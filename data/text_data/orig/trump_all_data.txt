SPEECH 1


...Thank you so much.
That's so nice.
Isn't he a great guy.
He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it.
It's just not fair.
And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party.
Also, also the people of Iowa.
They have something in common.
Hard-working people.
They want to work, they want to make the country great.
I love the people of Iowa.
So that's the way it is.
Very simple.
With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job.
The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused.
Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible.
In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray.
Very simple.
Politicians are all talk, no action.
They are all talk and no action.
And it's constant; it never ends.
And I'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and I'm a Republican.
And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians.
Because they let the president get away with absolute murder.
You see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to--.
Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.
You look at Obamacare.
A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster.
People are closing up shops.
Doctors are quitting the business.
I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.
He said, I have more accountants than I have patients.
And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business.
And he was very successful guy.
But it's happening more and more.
Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website.
I have many websites, many, many websites.
They're all over the place.
But for $10, okay?
Now everything about Obamacare was a lie.
It was a filthy lie.
And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted?
Does anyone do anything?
And what are the Republican politicians doing about it?
He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect.
You can keep your plan.
And you've all heard that hundreds of times.
That's like the real estate location, location.
I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location.
But you have heard this about Obamacare.
And it's disgraceful.
It's a big, fat, horrible lie.
Your deductibles are going through the roof.
You're not going to get--unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage.
And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore.
So it's a real, real disaster.
And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare.
And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it.
Now, we have to build a fence.
And it's got to be a beauty.
Who can build better than Trump?
I build; it's what I do.
I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings.
Fences are easy, believe me.
I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border.
They're walking.
The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country.
It is so terrible.
It is so unfair.
It is so incompetent.
And we don't have the best coming in.
We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks.
You can certainly have terrorists.
You can certainly have Islamic terrorists.
You can have anything coming across the border.
We don't do anything about it.
So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border.
Again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it.
Benghazi.
Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi.
Everything is Benghazi.
What happens?
Nothing.
IRS, e-mails.
I get sued all the time, okay.
I run a big business.
You know I've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful.
I have done so many deals.
Almost all of them have been tremendously successful.
You'll see that when I file my statements.
I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay.
But I've always said, and I said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president.
Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many--  Look, Obama, what did he do?
No deal.
He never did a deal.
He did one deal.
A house.
And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay.
He got away with murder.
But I can tell you, e-mails.
IRS, the e-mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost.
If you were in my world you would know that e-mails can't be lost; they can't be lost.
So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are?
They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it.
Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great.
But they talk about it.
And then you have a president that does an executive order.
Nobody even heard of an executive order.
He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.
Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.
Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it.
We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.
So we have to do something.
Jobs.
China.
I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese.
One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it.
And I know them.
And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with.
We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.
They tell me that.
Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.
But they tell me that.
And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries.
The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.
I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing.
They are devaluing down to nothing.
And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.
And they're getting away with it.
And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.
But you watch this devaluation of all of it.
I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.
And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.
You know it's one of those things, sounds good.
Be very careful.
Be very careful.
Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.
They have it set.
Don't forget another thing.
China became the number one economic power a year ago.
That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.
It was absolutely unthinkable.
So it happened and it's very, very sad.
Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.
We got nothing.
They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us.
Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.
We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.
By the way, you know how they formed.
They took the oil.
And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.
So now ISIS has the oil.
And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take.
So we get nothing.
We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.
I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.
And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.
But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.
We have incompetent people.
They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing.
It needs money.
We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security.
'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security.
I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid.
Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security.
And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.
It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things.
Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.
We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.
We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.
We can't do it.
Can't do it.
We cannot let that happen.
You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other.
Here we are in Syria.
We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.
Think of this.
We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government.
Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.
But think of it; think of it.
ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.
There are so many things; there are so many things.
But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.
Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.
You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.
The power.
And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.
We've never had this before.
We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there.
We're trying to do the right thing.
We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.
You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find.
The same thing is happening there.
And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.
And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals.
They're taking it out.
Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.
So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.
It's really, really crazy.
So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.
If we don't--  The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed.
Bridges are collapsing all over the country.
The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure.
I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai.
I go to various different places.
I go to China.
They are building a bridge on every corner.
They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff.
They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.
They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say "cutter" but I've always said "qatar" so I'll keep it "qatar" what the hell.
But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.
And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes.
The place is falling apart.
You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart.
And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.
So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.
This is inside, not outside.
And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.
In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor.
I said it's not an honor; they're just smart.
But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling.
You look at all of the things that are bad--  I'll give you an example.
And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.
You know the guard rails.
The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.
Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.
Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.
Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.
Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.
Somebody made a lot of money on that.
They don't know what is happening.
So we have to make our country great again.
We have to rebuild our country.
And we have a long way to go.
We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.
Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it.
We owe it to other countries.
They're the ones that hold the debt.
And then we give them money.
We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies.
I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know--  No American company comes to see and comes to bid.
It's South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them.
What are we doing; why aren't they paying us?
Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing?
I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's South Korea.
You know whether it's China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea.
Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on?
Now, we have a very important election coming up.
We have a presidential election coming up.
And we have some good people.
Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details.
We have some good people.
It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed.
He failed.
I mean I liked him.
Look--like him, dislike him--the 47% statement that he made, that's not going away.
The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away.
What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time.
It's not fair because it was a long t--  That doesn't work.
But more importantly, he choked.
Something happened to him in the last month.
He had that election won.
And let me tell you something.
That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal.
I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one-yard line, they go ah, ah I can't close it.
Or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament.
And there are many of them.
Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that.
You can't give somebody another chance, 'cause actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president.
I really do.
I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true.
So you can't have Romney.
He choked.
You can't have Bush.
The last thing we need is another Bush.
Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing--  You know they copied it.
I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing.
But I said it.
I was the one that said it first, and I mean it.
The last thing we need is another Bush.
Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that.
But he's totally in favor of Common Core.
He's very, very weak on immigration.
Don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love.
I say, what?
Come for love?
You've got these people coming, half of them are criminals.
They're coming for love?
They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love.
And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama.
I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama.
'Cause Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months.
And then he appointed Justice Roberts.
And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts.
And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes.
So you can't have Jeb Bush.
And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win.
So Mitt and--you just can't have those two.
That's it.
That's it.
It's so simple.
So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important.
And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters.
And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet.
He is reading it.
I mean give me a break.
Everything is read.
You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk.
And that's what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.
But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing.
No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that.
But we have to do something about these teleprompters.
But in looking at these situations--  I built an incredible company.
And you'll see that.
An incredible company; a wonderful company.
I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing.
And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix.
We have such great potential.
So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in:
creating jobs;
defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists--and you have to do that;
reducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it;
securing our Southern border--and I mean seriously securing it;
stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere;
saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it;
repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country.
And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody.
And everybody can be covered.
I'm not saying leave 50-percent of the people out.
Everybody can be c-- This plan is just a basic disaster.
Nobody knows.
As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is;
fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports.
And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump.
I just got the best hotel in North America.
I'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one.
I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress.
Right on Penn.--  The  Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama.
Do you believe that?
And everybody wanted it.
So, I can't believe it myself.
But it's going to be fantastic;
and so many other things.
I know what needs to be done to make America great again.
We can make this country great again.
The potential is enormous.
And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job.
Thank you all very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.
Beautiful.
Thank you.
SPEECH 2


Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation.
It truly is a great honor.
Id like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.
Its time to shake the rust off Americas foreign policy.
Its time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do.
The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle.
My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else.
It has to be first.
Has to be.
That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.
America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration.
But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back.
We have a lot to be proud of.
In the 1940s we saved the world.
The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists.
Then we saved the world again.
This time, from totalitarianism and communism.
The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big.
Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.
History will not forget what he did.
A very special man and president.
Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course.
We failed to develop a new vision for a new time.
In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense.
Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.
They just kept coming and coming.
We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obamas line in the sand in Syria.
Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.
Very bad.
It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.
We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed.
Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted.
Horribly wasted.
Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result.
The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill.
Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.
They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us.
Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster.
No vision.
No purpose.
No direction.
No strategy.
Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.
First, our resources are totally over extended.
President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy.
Hes crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders.
Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.
Were rebuilding other countries while weakening our own.
Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength.
I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.
Im the only one  believe me, I know them all, Im the only one who knows how to fix it.
Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and Ive been talking about this recently a lot.
Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden.
But many of them are simply not doing so.
They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us.
In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense.
We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.
The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.
We have no choice.
The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security.
A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.
Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they cant depend on us.
Weve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that weve never seen before in the history of our country.
He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry.
Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed.
Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.
And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.
All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Irans treatment of our ten captured sailors  so vividly I remember that day.
In negotiation, you must be willing to walk.
The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.
When the other side knows youre not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win  you just cant win.
At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them.
Youve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place.
President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic.
He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.
Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity.
Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.
President Obama has not been a friend to Israel.
He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power.
Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what weve done.
All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.
Weve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now theyre starting to look elsewhere for help.
Remember that.
Not good.
Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us.
In fact, theyre just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they dont take us seriously anymore.
The truth is they dont respect us.
When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.
Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One.
Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia.
Its called no respect.
Absolutely no respect.
Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth  fourth place?
The president of the United States making this trip  unprecedented  comes in fourth place.
He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment.
We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.
The list of humiliations go on and on and on.
President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach.
Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea.
We have the leverage.
We have the power over China, economic power, and people dont understand it.
And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.
He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies.
Weve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do.
They do at will.
It always happens.
If President Obamas goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.
Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals.
Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, weve lacked a coherent foreign policy.
One day, were bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians.
The next day, were watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart.
Lives lost, massive moneys lost.
The world is a different place.
Were a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess.
Weve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before.
We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.
We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action.
Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and were in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama wont even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.
Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country.
After Secretary Clintons failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans.
Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep.
Incredible.
Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie.
Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation.
And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 oclock in the morning.
And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil.
And you know what?
We dont blockade, we dont bomb, we dont do anything about it.
Its almost as if our country doesnt even know whats happening, which could be a fact and could be true.
This will all change when I become president.
To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again.
America is going to be reliable again.
Its going to be a great and reliable ally again.
Its going to be a friend again.
Were going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.
Were getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world.
Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the waters edge.
We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties  Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.
This is how we won the Cold War and its how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.
First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam.
Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world.
Events may require the use of military force, but its also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.
In this, were going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else.
It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.
We should work  thank you.
We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam.
But this has to be a two-way street.
They must also be good to us.
Remember that.
They have to be good to us, no longer one way.
Its now two-way.
And remember, us and all were doing, they have to appreciate what weve done to them.
Were going to help, but they have to appreciate what weve done for them.
The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland.
There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism.
For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more.
We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.
We have no idea where these people are coming from.
Theres no documentation.
Theres no paperwork.
Theres nothing.
We have to be smart.
We have to be vigilant.
A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse.
All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at whats happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked  one of the true great catastrophes.
And then theres ISIS.
I have a simple message for them.
Their days are numbered.
I wont tell them where and I wont tell them how.
We must...






... we must as a nation be more unpredictable.
We are totally predictable.
We tell everything.
Were sending troops.
We tell them.
Were sending something else.
We have a news conference.
We have to be unpredictable.
And we have to be unpredictable starting now.
But theyre going to be gone.
ISIS will be gone if Im elected president.
And theyll be gone quickly.
They will be gone very, very quickly.
Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy.
The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at whats happened to us.
Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal.
And it has to happen immediately.
Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today.
The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time.
The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991.
Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today.
These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.
And what are we doing about this?
President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011.
Our military is depleted and were asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.
We will spend what we need to rebuild our military.
It is the cheapest, single investment we can make.
We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind.
Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.
But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely.
In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem.
But I do.
No one dollar can be wasted.
Not one single dollar can we waste.
Were also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again.
And to put Americans first again.
This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again.
So, so important.
We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.
This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare.
A great country also takes care of its warriors.
Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute.
A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve.
And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life.
Our veterans...






Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly.
These are our great people and we must treat them fairly.
We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.
Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests.
Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries.
Look at what happened in the 1990s.
Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania  and this was a horrible time for us  were attacked.
and 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S.
Cole.
And what did we do?
It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States.
Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda.
We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didnt do it


And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Again, the worst attack on our country in its history.
Our foreign policy goals must be based on Americas core national security interests.
And the following will be my priorities.
In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change.
We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.
And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.
: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them.
And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.
We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China.
We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries.
We should seek common ground based on shared interests.
Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism.
I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible.
Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon.
Good for both countries.
Some say the Russians wont be reasonable.
I intend to find out.
If we cant make a deal under my administration, a deal thats great  not good, great  for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table.
Its as simple as that.
Were going to find out.
Fixing our relations with China is another important step  and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time.
China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.
We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance.
A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now.
Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea.
Theyre not supposed to be doing it.
No respect for this country or this president.
We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.
If need be, thats whats going to have to happen.
After Im elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies.
In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges.
For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATOs outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.
I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative.
But if America fights, it must only fight to win.
I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.






Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction.
The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy.
With President Obama and Secretary Clinton weve had the exact opposite  a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.
After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before.
I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton.
It has been a complete and total disaster.
I will also be prepared to deploy Americas economic resources.
Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.
Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules.
In other words, if they do not treat us fairly.
Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand.
Believe me.
However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct.
You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy.
A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength.
Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East.
Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.
And now, to top it off, we have ISIS.
My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations.
Thats why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect rsums but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.
We have to look to new people.
We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly dont know what theyre doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.
Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions.
Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.
These are my goals as president.
I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome.
The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, thats what we want.
We want them to be our allies.
We want the world to be  we want to bring peace to the world.
Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons.
The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.
To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership.
Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own.
Americans.
Americans must know that were putting the American people first again on trade.
So true.
On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy.
The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.
No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first.
Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same.
We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony.
I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.
And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.
NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states  literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs.
And Ive just gotten to see it.
Ive toured Pennsylvania.
Ive toured New York.
Ive toured so many of the states.
They have been cleaned out.
Their manufacturing is gone.
Never again, only the reverse  and I have to say this strongly  never again; only the reverse will happen.
We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones.
There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later.
They fire the people.
They take advantage of the United States.
There will be consequences for those companies.
Never again.
Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.
I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests.
I will be Americas greatest defender and most loyal champion.
We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.
The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest.
America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker.
We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.
And always  always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again.
We must make America truly wealthy again.
And we must  we have to and we will make America great again.
And if we do that  and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known.
Thank you very much, everybody.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
SPEECH 3


A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem.
Like, little.
Look at my hands.
Theyre fine.
Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that.
My hands are normal hands.
During a debate, he was losing, and he said, "Oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means."
This was not me.
This was Rubio that said, "He has small hands and you know what that means."
Okay?
So, he started it.
So, what I said a couple of days later ... and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, "Mr. Trump, you have strong hands.
You have good-sized hands."
And then another one would say, "You have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea."
I said, "What do you mean?"
He said, "I thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands."
I had fifty people ... Is that a correct statement?
I mean people were writing, "How are Mr. Trumps hands?"
My hands are fine.
You know, my hands are normal.
Slightly large, actually.
In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay?
No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, "Oh, your hands are very nice.
They are normal."
So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say ... now I was hitting him pretty hard.
He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didnt work out.
Obviously, it didnt work too well.
But one of the things he said was "He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else."
You can look it up.
I didnt say it.
I dont want people to go around thinking that I have a problem.
Im telling you, Ruth, I had so many people.
I would say 25, 30 people would tell me ... every time Id shake peoples hand, "Oh, you have nice hands."
Why shouldnt I?
And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem.
Nobody questions ...
I even held up my hands, and said, "Look, take a look at that hand."
I dont know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not.
He said, Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.
I didnt say that.
And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint.
And everybody took it fine.
Whether it was presidential or not I cant tell you.
I can just say that what he said was a lie.
And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did.
And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand.
You know, when Ive got a big audience.
So yeah, I think its not a question of presidential ...
SPEECH 4

We love Nevada.

I said, "Phil I dont want your money.
I dont want to do it.

Every time I see him.
Its hard for me to turn down money because thats what Ive done in my whole life.
I grab and grab and grab.
You know I get greedy.
I want money, money.
Ill tell you what were going to do, right?

"Donald I think you should do this and that."
His advice I like to listen to, Ill be honest.

So we won the evangelicals.
We won with young.
We won with old.
We won with highly educated.
We won with poorly educated.

Were going to have our borders nice and strong.
Were going to build the wall, you know that.
Were going to build the wall.
And I have a lot of respect from Mexico, and you just heard we won Hispanics.
But let me tell you Mexico is going to pay for the wall, right?
Its going to happen.
Its going to happen.
They know it.
I know it.
We all know it.
We have a tremendous deficit.
We have a trade deficit with Mexico.
Theyll pay for the wall.
Theyll be very happy about it.
Believe me.
Ill talk to them.
Theyre going to be very, very thrilled.
Theyre going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall.
Were going to be the smart people.

SPEECH 5


Wow.
Whoa.
That is some group of people.
Thousands.
So nice, thank you very much.
Thats really nice.
Thank you.
Its great to be at Trump Tower.
Its great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
And its an honor to have everybody here.
This is beyond anybodys expectations.
Theres been no crowd like this.
And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
They didnt know the air-conditioner didnt work.
They sweated like dogs.
They didnt know the room was too big, because they didnt have anybody there.
How are they going to beat ISIS?
I dont think its gonna happen.
Our country is in serious trouble.
We dont have victories anymore.
We used to have victories, but we dont have them.
When was the last time anybody saw us beating, lets say, China in a trade deal?
They kill us.
I beat China all the time.
All the time.
When did we beat Japan at anything?
They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo?
It doesnt exist, folks.
They beat us all the time.
When do we beat Mexico at the border?
Theyre laughing at us, at our stupidity.
And now they are beating us economically.
They are not our friend, believe me.
But theyre killing us economically.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody elses problems.
SPEECH 6


Thank you.
Its true, and these are the best and the finest.
When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best.
Theyre not sending you.
Theyre not sending you.
Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems with us.
Theyre bringing drugs.
Theyre bringing crime.
Theyre rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people.
oh And it only makes common sense.
It only makes common sense.
Theyre sending us not the right people.
Its coming from more than Mexico.
Its coming from all over South and Latin America, and its coming probably  probably  from the Middle East.
But we dont know.
Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we dont know whats happening.
And its got to stop and its got to stop fast.
Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
Theyve become rich.
Im in competition with them.
They just built a hotel in Syria.
Can you believe this?
They built a hotel.
When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
They dont have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we shouldve taken.
So now ISIS has the oil, and what they dont have, Iran has.
And in 19  and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said  and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that weve ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
But I said, "Dont hit Iraq," because youre going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
Think of it.
Iran is taking over Iraq, and theyre taking it over big league.
We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love  theyre great  all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
And we have nothing.
We cant even go there.
We have nothing.
And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees  these are big vehicles  were left behind for the enemy.
2,000?
You would say maybe two, maybe four?
2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product  a sign of strength, right?
But not for us.
It was below zero.
Whoever heard of this?
Its never below zero.
Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
Dont believe the 5.6.
Dont believe it.
Thats right.
A lot of people up there cant get jobs.
They cant get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
They all have jobs.
But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because its a statistic thats full of nonsense.
Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
Even our nuclear arsenal doesnt work.
It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
They dont know if it worked.
And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
They dont know what theyre doing.
They dont know what theyre doing."
We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare.
Obamacare.
Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, its virtually useless.
Its virtually useless.
It is a disaster.TRUMP: And remember the $5 billion Web site?
$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesnt work.
A $5 billion Web site.
If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISISs ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.
ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.
The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.
The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didnt see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States.
He doesnt see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.
For a religious leader to question a persons faith is disgraceful.
I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President.
No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another mans religion or faith.
They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.
I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
I hire people, they do a Web site.
It costs me $3.
$5 billion Web site.
Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
Nothings gonna get done.
They will not bring us  believe me  to the promised land.
They will not.
As an example, Ive been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
And theyre wonderful people.
I like them.
They all want me to support them.
They dont know how to bring it about.
They come up to my office.
Im meeting with three of them in the next week.
And they dont know  "Are you running?
Are you not running?
Could we have your support?
What do we do?
How do we do it?"
I like them.
And I hear their speeches.
And they dont talk jobs and they dont talk China.
When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
Theyre devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldnt believe.
It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
Theyre killing us.
But you dont hear that from anybody else.
You dont hear it from anybody else.
And I watch the speeches.
Thank you.
I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
And people are saying, "Whats going on?
I just want a job.
Just get me a job.
I dont need the rhetoric.
I want a job."
And thats whats happening.
And its going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in 16, 2016.
Obama is going to be out playing golf.
He might be on one of my courses.
I would invite him, I actually would say.
I have the best courses in the world, so Id say, you what, if he wants to  I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
If hed like to play, thats fine.
In fact, Id love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
Really big league.
It is going to be amazingly destructive.
Doctors are quitting.
I have a friend whos a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
I have more accountants than I have nurses.
Its a disaster.
My patients are beside themselves.
They had a plan that was good.
They have no plan now."
We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be  and  and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
Let it be for everybody.
But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
And we can do it.
So Ive watched the politicians.
Ive dealt with them all my life.
If you cant make a good deal with a politician, then theres something wrong with you.
Youre certainly not very good.
And thats what we have= representing us.
They will never make America great again.
They dont even have a chance.
Theyre controlled fully  theyre controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
Yes, they control them.
Hey, I have lobbyists.
I have to tell you.
I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
Theyre great.
But you know what?
it wont happen.
It wont happen.
Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, its destroying our country.
We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
Our vets have been abandoned.
And we also need a cheerleader.
You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think hell do well.
I think hell be a great cheerleader for the country.
I think hed be a great spirit."
He was vibrant.
He was young.
I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
Hes not a leader.
Thats true.
Youre right about that.
But he wasnt a cheerleader.
Hes actually a negative force.
Hes been a negative force.
He wasnt a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
Its not great again.
We need  we need somebody  we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
We can do that.
And, I will tell you, I love my life.
I have a wonderful family.
Theyre saying, "Dad, youre going to do something thats going to be so tough."
You know, all of my life, Ive heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
Just cant happen.
And yet thats the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
So ladies and gentlemen...
I am officially running...






... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
It can happen.
Our country has tremendous potential.
We have tremendous people.
We have people that arent working.
We have people that have no incentive to work.
But theyre going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
And theyll be proud, and theyll love it, and theyll make much more than they wouldve ever made, and theyll be  theyll be doing so well, and were going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
It can happen.
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
I tell you that.
Ill bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
Ill bring back our jobs, and Ill bring back our money.
Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
We owe Japan more than that.
So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deals even better.
How stupid are our leaders?
How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
How stupid are they?
Im going to tell you  thank you.
Im going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because Im totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
Number one, the people negotiating dont have a clue.
Our president doesnt have a clue.
Hes a bad negotiator.
Hes the one that did Bergdahl.
We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
We get Bergdahl.
We get a traitor.
We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
Thats the negotiator we have.
Take a look at the deal hes making with Iran.
He makes that deal, Israel maybe wont exist very long.
Its a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
But...
So we need people  Im a free trader.
But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
If you dont have talented people, if you dont have great leadership, if you dont have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
We have people that arent smart.
And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
And its just not going to work.
So, heres a couple of stories happened recently.
A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything  everything, they got away with it again.
And its impossible for our people here to compete.
So I want to tell you this story.
A friend of mine whos a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
Hes very upset.
I said, "Whats your problem?"
He said, "You know, I make great product."
And I said, "I know.
I know that because I buy the product."
He said, "I cant get it into China.
They wont accept it.
I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
I said, "Oh, wait a minute, thats terrible.
Does anyone know this?"
He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
I said, "They send it back?"
"Yeah.
So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.
Theyre not supposed to be doing that.
I told them."
Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
Ask Boeing.
They wanted Boeings secrets.
They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
Hey, Im not saying theyre stupid.
I like China.
I sell apartments for  I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
Am I supposed to dislike them?
I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
Very valuable.
I love China.
The biggest bank in the world is from China.
You know where their United States headquarters is located?
In this building, in Trump Tower.
I love China.
People say, "Oh, you dont like China?"
No, I love them.
But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we cant sustain ourself with that.
Theres too much  its like  its like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
Thats the difference between Chinas leaders and our leaders.
They are ripping us.
We are rebuilding China.
Were rebuilding many countries.
China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
And theyre all over the place.
We have all the cards, but we dont know how to use them.
We dont even know that we have the cards, because our leaders dont understand the game.
We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
Now theyre going militarily.
Theyre building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
A military island.
Now, our country could never do that because wed have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldnt let our country  we would never build in an ocean.
They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
Theyre building up their military to a point that is very scary.
You have a problem with ISIS.
You have a bigger problem with China.
And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
I say, "Thats a terrible story.
I hate to hear it."
But I have another one, Ford.
So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
Everybody thought the deal was dead.
Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
Everybody thought it was a done deal.
Its going in and thats going to be it, going into Tennessee.
Great state, great people.TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces theyre not going to Tennessee.
Theyre gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
Not good.
Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
$2.5 billion, its going to be one of the largest in the world.
Ford.
Good company.
So I announced that Im running for president.
I would...






... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in  and I wouldnt even use  you know, I have  I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
I know the good ones.
I know the bad ones.
I know the overrated ones.
You get a lot of them that are overrated.
Theyre not good.
They think they are.
They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
But theyre not good.
But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
Believe me, folks.
We will do very, very well, very, very well.
But I wouldnt even waste my time with this one.
I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
If I was president, Id say, "Congratulations.
I understand that youre building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that youre going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
"How does that help us?
Where is that good"?
Its not.
So I would say, "Congratulations.
Thats the good news.
Let me give you the bad news.
Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, were going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and thats it.
Now, heres what is going to happen.
If its not me in the position, its one of these politicians that were running against, you know, the 400 people that were (inaudible).
And heres whats going to happen.
Theyre not so stupid.
They know its not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
But then theyre going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You cant do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you cant do that to Ford."
And guess what?
No problem.
Theyre going to build in Mexico.
Theyre going to take away thousands of jobs.
Its very bad for us.
So under President Trump, heres what would happen:






The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
But it could be hed want to be cool, and hell wait until the next day.
You know, they want to be a little cool.
And hell say, "Please, please, please."
Hell beg for a little while, and Ill say, "No interest."
Then hell call all sorts of political people, and Ill say, "Sorry, fellas.
No interest," because I dont need anybodys money.
Its nice.
I dont need anybodys money.
Im using my own money.
Im not using the lobbyists.
Im not using donors.
I dont care.
Im really rich.
I (inaudible).
And by the way, Im not even saying that in a  thats the kind of mindset, thats the kind of thinking you need for this country.
So  because we got to make the country rich.
It sounds crass.
Somebody said, "Oh, thats crass."
Its not crass.
We got $18 trillion in debt.
We got nothing but problems.
We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
Weve got nothing.
Weve got Social Security thats going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesnt bring money into the country.
All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
Im not going to cut it at all; Im going to bring money in, and were going to save it.
But heres whats going to happen:


After Im called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after Im called by all of the special interests and by the  the donors and by the lobbyists  and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero  Ill get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
Hell say.
"Please reconsider," Ill say no.
Hell say, "Mr. President, weve decided to move the plant back to the United States, and were not going to build it in Mexico."
Thats it.
They have no choice.
They have no choice.
There are hundreds of things like that.
Ill give you another example.TRUMP: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
$1 billion a day.
I love the Saudis.
Many are in this building.
They make a billion dollars a day.
Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
We say "were gonna protect."
What are we doing?
Theyve got nothing but money.
If the right person asked them, theyd pay a fortune.
They wouldnt be there except for us.
And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
Everybody got out  and they kept our equipment.
They always keep our equipment.
We ought to send used equipment, right?
They always keep our equipment.
We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be  we ought to send our surplus.
Were always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
They;re gone.
And Im the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
You know, all of these politicians that Im running against now  its so nice to say Im running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
Im running.
But all of these politicians that Im running against now, theyre trying to disassociate.
I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
He couldnt answer the question.
He didnt know.
I said, "Is he intelligent?"
Then I looked at Rubio.
He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
He didnt know.
He couldnt answer the question.
How are these people gonna lead us?
How are we gonna  how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
We cant.
They dont have a clue.
They cant lead us.
They cant.
They cant even answer simple questions.
It was terrible.
But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
They were smarter than our leaders.
There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
Because we need money.
Were dying.
Were dying.
We need money.
We have to do it.
And we need the right people.
So Ford will come back.
Theyll all come back.
And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, thats based on competence.
So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, youre not a nice person.
How can you get people to vote for you?"
I said, "I dont know."
I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
I think Im actually a very nice person."
But, I said, "This is going to be an election thats based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
And theyre tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
And theyre tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
And some of them are like third world countries.
But were becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what Ill do.
Ill do it.
Because a lot of people said, "Hell never run.
Number one, he wont want to give up his lifestyle."
Theyre right about that, but Im doing it.
Number two, Im a private company, so nobody knows what Im worth.
And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
So I said, "Thats OK." Im proud of my net worth.
Ive done an amazing job.
I started off  thank you  I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said  and I love my father.
I learned so much.
He was a great negotiator.
I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
But I learned a lot.
But he used to say, "Donald, dont go into Manhattan.
Thats the big leagues.
We dont know anything about that.
Dont do it."
I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
I gotta build those big buildings.
I gotta do it, Dad.
Ive gotta do it."
And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals  the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
And now Im building all over the world, and I love what Im doing.
But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is hes private and hes probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
So I said to myself, you know, nobodys ever going to know unless I run, because Im really proud of my success.
I really am.
Ive employed  Ive employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
That means medical.
That means education.
That means everything.
So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because its big and complex, and theyve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we dont extensions or anything.
Well be filing it right on time.
We dont need anything.
And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
So I said (ph), "No, thats the wrong number.
Thats the wrong number.
Not assets."
So they put together this.
And before I say it, I have to say this.
I made it the old-fashioned way.
Its real estate.
You know, its real estate.
Its labor, and its unions good and some bad and lots of people that arent in unions, and its all over the place and building all over the world.
And I have assets  big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected  9 billion 240 million dollars.
And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
Thats long-term debt, very low interest rates.
In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you dont have enough borrowings.
Could we loan you $4 billion"?
I said, "I dont need it.
I dont want it.
And Ive been there.
I dont want it."
But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, itll be well-over $10 billion.
But here, a total net worth of  net worth, not assets, not  a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets  Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York  many other places all over the world.
So the total is $8,737,540,00.
Now Im not doing that...






Im not doing that to brag, because you know what?
I dont have to brag.
I dont have to, believe it or not.
Im doing that to say that thats the kind of thinking our country needs.
We need that thinking.
We have the opposite thinking.
We have losers.
We have losers.
We have people that dont have it.
We have people that are morally corrupt.
We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
So I put together this statement, and the only reason Im telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years  you know, were at $8 trillion now.
Were soon going to be at $20 trillion.TRUMP: According to the economists  who Im not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what theyre saying  that $24 trillion  were very close  thats the point of no return.
$24 trillion.
We will be there soon.
Thats when we become Greece.
Thats when we become a country thats unsalvageable.
And were gonna be there very soon.
Were gonna be there very soon.
I will immediately terminate President Obamas illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
Now, its very interesting.
Today I heard it.
Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
I didnt want guns.
And now since this happened"  its up in the prison area  "my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns.
We now have a gun on every table.
Were ready to start shooting."
I said, "Very interesting."
So protect the Second Amendment.
End  end Common Core.
Common Core should  it is a disaster.
Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
I dont see how he can possibly get the nomination.
Hes weak on immigration.
Hes in favor of Common Core.
How the hell can you vote for this guy?
You just cant do it.
We have to end  education has to be local.
Rebuild the countrys infrastructure.
Nobody can do that like me.
Believe me.
It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
You know, were building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, were converting it into one of the worlds great hotels.
Its gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
The Obama administration.
We got it.
It was the most highly sought after  or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
We got it.
People were shocked, Trump got it.
Well, I got it for two reasons.
Number one, were really good.
Number two, we had a really good plan.
And Ill add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
And they wanted to make sure it got built.
So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
You come into La Guardia Airport, its like were in a third world country.
You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
You have all of these disastrous airports.
We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
Have to do it.
Get rid of the fraud.
Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
People have been paying it for years.
And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money thats being lost.
Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, were in a bubble.
We have artificially low interest rates.
We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see whats happening.
We have a stock market that is so bloated.
Be careful of a bubble because what youve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
So be very, very careful.
And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
So, so important.
SPEECH 7




Chris, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
This has been an amazing evening.
Already, weve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine.
Its really been  its really been great.
I want to congratulation Ted on the winning of Texas.
He worked hard on he  I know how hard he worked actually, and so I congratulate Ted Cruz on that win.
That was an excellent win.
Were going to make America great again, folks.
Were going to make it great again.
And, you know, I watched Hillarys speech and shes talking about wages have been poor and everythings poor and everythings doing badly, but were going to make it  shes been there for so long.
I mean, if she hasnt straightened it out by now, shes not going to straighten it out in the next four years.
Its just going to become worse and worse.
She wants to make America whole again and Im trying to figure out what is that all about.
Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again.
So I just want to say that this was an exciting evening.
Its so great to be in Florida.
Its so great to be at Mar-A-Lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.
I know it was a very tough night for Marco Rubio.
He had a tough night but he worked hard.
He spent a lot of money.
He is a lightweight, as Ive said many times before.
But you know what?
Were going to go to Florida, were going to spend so much time in Florida.
Weve got about a 20-point lead.
I know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, theyre going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires.
And frankly, I think thats fine.
As far as Im concerned, its fine.
And if he wins, theyll have totally controlled  total control.
But hes not going anywhere anyway, but well see what happens.
But were going to spend a lot of time in Florida.
The Virginia one was just a great win because its a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in Florida.
Remember, we have thousands of employees in Florida, all along Miami, Doral and Mar-A-Lago and so many other places.
And its been an amazing place to invest.
Its been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on.
And you know, I have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, well just say all over the country.
And its been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly.
Recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation.
I mean, our nation is in serious trouble.
Were being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed.
China is just taking advantage of us.
I have nothing against China.
I have great respect for China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders.
Our leaders dont have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much.
No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit.
It wont be that way for long.
We have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, were going to redo those trade deals and its going to be a thing of beauty.
You look at countries like Mexico, where theyre killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border.
Theyre destroying us in terms of economic development.
Companies like Carrier Air Conditioner just moving into Mexico.
Ford, moving into Mexico.
Nabisco, closing up shop in Chicago and moving into Mexico.
We have to stop it, folks.
I know how to stop it.
Were going to create jobs.
Were going to create jobs like youve never seen.
Were going to lower taxes.
I have a plan that Larry Kudlow and so many others think is the best plan theyve seen.
Were going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class.
The middle class has been forgotten in our country.
It really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and were all so proud of, but weve forgotten the middle class.
So were going to lower taxes.
Were lowering taxes on business.
You look at all the companies that are moving out.
When you see Pfizer moving to Ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now theyre leaving.
They used to move from New York to Florida, or theyd move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris.
But now theyre moving from here    not that many people are leaving New Jersey.
But Chris understands the problem, fully understands.
Now theyre leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world.
We cant let that happen.
Weve lost our manufacturing jobs.
Weve lost our manufacturing.
Millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses.
I mean, we are losing so much.
We cant let it happen.
I tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders Caterpillar.
And recently, he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because theyve cut the yen.
Theyve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete.
And I dont want that to happen.
Thats not going to happen.
They shouldnt be allowed to do it.
We have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source.
We have great, great power.
The problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly dont know what theyre doing.
So were going to work very, very hard.
Im so honored by this evening.
If you wouldve told me on June 16th, when I was with my wife, Melania, and we came down the escalator in Trump Tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this.
You have a lot of cameras here tonight.
It looked, literally, like the Academy Awards.
I never saw so many cameras in my life.
And it takes courage to run.
Ill tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president.
Ive never done this before.
Ive been a job-producer.
Ive done a lot of things but this is something Ive never done, but I felt we had to do it.
When you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing.
When you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted.
Were going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.
So its just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight.
And if you want, press, I think we told you before wed be okay if you want to ask a few questions.
Yes, go ahead.
Well, they can always do that and then theyll  then theyll just lose everything and that would be the  that would be the work of a loser.
But let me just explain something.
If youve seen whats happened, whether you go to South Carolina, where I had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in New Hampshire, tremendous in Nevada, you look at whats happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all.
I mean, right now, theyre projected I guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states.
Its Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts  (CHEERS)  Tennessee, Virginia.
And you know, these are amazing states and were going to probably get a lot more.
In fact, were projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.
But I will say this.
Look, we have expanded the Republican Party.
When you look at whats happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in.
They came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and theyre Democrats and theyre long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched.
And they were independents.
And weve actually expanded the party.
Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example.
Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes.
We doubled it.
We were almost 800,000.
Whereas the Democrats went down.
Theres much less enthusiasm for the Democrats.
So I  look, Im a unifier.
I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unifier.
Once we get all of this finished, Im going to go after one person, thats Hillary Clinton, on the assumption shes allowed to run, which is a big assumption.
I dont know that shes going to be allowed to run.
And I think thats, frankly, going to be an easy race.
You see the polls.
I beat Hillary in many polls.
I know one thing.
I dont think Marco is going to be able to beat her.
I dont think  in all fairness, I think Teds going to have a very hard time.
But Ted at least has a shot because at least hes won a little bit.
So I just tell you this.
We are going to be a much finer party, a much  were going to be a unified party, I mean, to be honest with you.
And we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening.
Were going to be a much bigger party.
Our party is expanding.
And all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where Ive won and just look  weve gone from X number to a much larger number.
That hasnt happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades.
So I think were going to be more inclusive.
I think were going to be more unified and I think were going to be a much bigger party, and I think were going to win in November.
OK, yeah?
Im just doing whats right.
Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some  for many, many  for millions of women.
And Ill say it and I know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say thats really  because Im a conservative, but Im a common-sense conservative.
But millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood.
But were not going to allow and were not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and Ive said it loud and clear.
But  and well see what happens.
But Planned Parenthood  millions of people  and Ive had thousands of letters from women that have been helped.
And this wasnt a setup.
This was people writing letters.
Im going to be really good for women.
Im going to be good for womens health issues.
Its very important to me, very important to me.
And maybe thats not a perfect conservative view, but I can tell you one thing.
Im more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of Obamacare and coming up with something much, much better, and certainly, getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that youre going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education.
So Sarah, I mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but I am a truth-teller and I will tell the truth, OK?
Yeah, go ahead, finish it.
I feel awfully good.
I mean, Im watching your people  Im watching your people on  and Im going to be very nice, Im going to be very nice  Im watching your people on CNN and Im watching the Fox people and Im watching the MSNBC people, too, OK?
See?
Im becoming diplomatic.
And they are certainly being very nice to me tonight.
I mean, you know, theyre being very strong.
And they are, theyre declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night, which is true.
He didnt win anything.
He hasnt won anything, period.
And by the way, and I have to tell you  and he was very, very nasty.
Ive never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but hes got a right to be nasty.
He hasnt won anything and hes not going to win very much.
But I do congratulate Ted because I know how hard Ted worked on Texas and its a big get.
Now I also did very well in Texas.
I came in second.
And one of the things my son, Eric, told me, which I didnt even realize, is that not only did I win most of the states  and some are coming in and Im expected to win them  but I came in second  I came in no worse than second.
So it wasnt like I won and then I disappeared.
The worst I had was a second.
So Im very, very honored by the turnout, OK?
Yes, go ahead.
Right.
Oh, theyre totally wrong.
Look, I disavowed.
I disavowed when I  in fact, Chris is my number one  Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign.
He called me.
He said, "Donald, what youve got is a movement."
We spoke today in Kentucky.
Youve never seen a crowd like that.
That had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible.
And every place were speaking, if we have 10,000 people its like a small group.
We had 35,000 people the other day in Alabama.
And when Chris called, he said this is a movement; this is something like Ive never seen.
And in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing.
Theyve never seen whats happening right now.
Theyve never seen anything like it.
And Im just honored by it.
Now, when Chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question.
I said I disavow.
Now, right after the program that were talking about  and I thought it was clear, but you know, were talking about groups, groups, groups.
I do have to know the name of the group because, who knows?
I mean, they have to give me the name of the group.
But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow.
Now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that.
It was right after.
And I disavowed then; I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, I disavowed again.
I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow?
But I disavow and hopefully its the final time I have to do it.
But if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter, right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure.
Yes, go ahead.
No, its not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and its going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation.
Its going to be a negotiation where well start at certain levels and hopefully I will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the American people.
So you know, look, you cant go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, hes done executive order, executive order.
Its almost like, I dont even know.
Does he ever go a deal with Congress anymore?
Does he ever speak to the Senate?
Does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done?
You know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that I  is very, very important to me; corporate inversion.
Carl Icahn, whos a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he  it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where were losing companies.
And were losing for two reasons.
Were losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high.
We have the highest  were the highest taxed nation in the world.
And very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country.
The Democrats agree it should be brought back in.
The Republicans agree it should be brought back in.
Everybody agrees it should be brought back in.
I could sit in a room  or the Oval Office  for a period of, literally, a half hour and I really believe I could get everybody  every single  you know, its one thing they dont agree on health care or they dont agree on common core or they dont agree on other things and theyll fight.
Heres something every single  I mean, almost everybody agrees.
These trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country.
The president cant make a deal.
The reason is he doesnt know how to make a deal, probably doesnt work at it, probably doesnt care, but youre talking about tremendous number of  tremendous amounts of money.
So when you have something that everybody wants and you cant make a deal, theres something going on thats really wrong.
And what it means is you have the wrong leader.
Yes?
Well, look, everything  we are going to have a wall.
I can tell you we are going to have a wall.
I watched the ex-president of Mexico, the arrogance of this man.
And I get along great with Hispanics.
You saw in Nevada, I won in the poll, the Hispanic vote.
I have thousands of people that work for me right now that are Hispanic.
Ive had thousands and thousands over my lifetime.
These are great people.
The Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it.
Vincente Fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have  if I ever used that word you folks wouldve never, ever, ever let me get away with it.
Nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word.
But he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall.
Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year  $58 billion.
The wall is going to cost $10 billion.
Its so easy.
Ive had these guys that Im on the stage with go you dont really mean Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
One  as sure as youre standing there, 100 percent, Mexicos going to pay, 100 percent.
And the reason is Im a businessman.
I know how to do this.
Politicians are all talk, no action.
Its not going to  except for Chris Christie, of course.
Its not  look, its not going to happen.
Its not going to happen with these people.
So when you think of it  and then they say youll never be able to build a wall.
Well, its 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles.
The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didnt have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere.
I buy a lot of equipment from John Deere.
I love John Deere, too.
But they didnt have tractors.
They didnt have cranes.
They didnt have excavation equipment.
The wall is 13,000 miles long.
We need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials.
We can do that so beautifully.
And this is going to be a serious wall.
This is going to be high wall.
This is going to be a very serious wall.
Were going to stop drugs from coming into New Hampshire.
You know, when I won New Hampshire, those people were so incredible to me.
And when you go, you wouldnt believe it because its so bucolic, so beautiful.
You look at the fields and you look at everything, its so beautiful.
And yet, you go to a meeting in New Hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine.
The heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted.
And I told them Im going to stop it.
Im going to stop it.
Were going to have a strong border, and I mean strong.
And by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and theyre going to come into this country, but theyre going to come in legally, OK?
Ive got to find out whats going on.
Weve got a big problem.
We have a big, big problem.
Ill tell it like it is.
We have a big, big problem.
Weve got to figure it out.
Were going to figure it out.
Radical Islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us.
You take a look at Germany, you take a look at Sweden, you take a look at Brussels.
You look at some of these places, its like a disaster.
And were not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, theyre young and theyre strong.
You look at that migration line; theyre young, theyre strong, theyre powerful.
And you say why arent they back fighting for their country?
Now, with all of that being said, I feel strongly  I have a bigger heart than anybody.
Were going to build a safe zone.
Its going to be in Syria.
And Im going to get the Gulf states, who have more money than anybody  weve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit.
Were going to get  but theyre not accepting people.
Were going to get  wait, wait, wait.
Were going to get the Gulf states to pay for it because they should.
Oh, were going to bring them back.
Were going to bring them back.
Look, Im telling you  you know how Im going to bring them back?
First of all, were going to do great with the African- Americans, and you see that in the polls where I had in one poll where Im 25 percent.
And one of the commentators, who I think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if Donald Trump gets 25 percent of the African-American vote, this election is over.
You watch.
And the reason Im getting that  and Im going to do great with the Hispanics.
Im going to do great with virtually every group.
The reason is Im going to bring jobs back.
Im going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China.
How does it help us when they make it in China?
Well, look, I always liked Marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile.
He decided to become Don Rickles, OK?
But Don Rickles has a lot more talent.
Honestly, I did, I always liked him but he became  you know, somebody told him youre losing very badly.
The only way you can possibly win, take the hail Mary, they called it a hail Mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile.
Its hurt him.
In fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent.
Its really hurt him.
But look, Im not going to tell him what to do.
Im not going to tell anybody what to do.
You have to run.
He had a bad night, according to CNN, Fox.
I watched their broadcasts.
They say the loser of the night was Marco Rubio and its true.
He didnt win anything.
He hasnt won.
I mean, at least you can say that Ted has won something, and you know, Marco has not won.
Youve got to be able to win.
You cant talk.
You know, these politicians, all talk, no action.
Youve got to be able to win something.
He hasnt won anything.
And he actually hasnt come very close.
So well see what happens.
Yes, go ahead.
Im going to be a good president for the world but we have a country thats in big trouble.
Our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports.
I go throughout the world.
I mean, you go to Qatar, you go to  some people say Qatar, but you go to Qatar, you go to any of  so many places.
You go to different places in China, different places in Asia, different places in the Middle East, you look at some of the airports they have.
You look at the roadways they have.
You look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have.
Were like a third world country.
So I am going to be very good for the world.
Im going to get along with the world.
Youre going to be very proud of me.
Even you will be very proud of me as a president.
But we have to rebuild our country.
Our country is going to hell and people dont understand that.
And Hillary Clinton doesnt have a clue.
She cant do that.
Shes talking about  I mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, I think one of the reasons I have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today  less money than they made 12 years ago.
And in her speech, she just said theyre making less money.
Well, shes been there with Obama for a long period of time.
Why hasnt she done anything about it?
Practically everything that she was complaining about  shes picked up what I say.
The difference is shes been there for a long period of time.
Why havent they done anything about it?
Then you look at her record as secretary of State.
Its abysmal.
You look at whats going on with Syria.
You look at whats going on with everything.
Its a disaster.
So were going to have an interesting period of time.
I dont know that shes going to be allowed to run.
What she did is a criminal act.
If shes allowed to run I would be very, very surprised.
But if shes allowed to run, honestly, itll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong.
And what she did  (CHEERS)  let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.
OK, one or two more questions.
Yeah, go ahead, Jeremy


At this moment, absolutely not, no.
We either have a country or we dont.
We have a country, or we dont.
We have borders or we dont have borders.
And at this moment, the answer is absolutely not.
Well, look, I dont expect  I have a lot of respect for Reince and for the group and I like the RNC and I dont know that Ive been treated fairly or not.
I really dont know.
I cant tell you that.
But I can tell you that I do respect them.
What I really have is a great number of people.
I have millions and millions of people.
And when I was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before I came in here because I wanted to see exactly where we were before I started speaking, I was amazed at the kind of numbers.
The Republicans have tremendous energy.
The Democrats dont.
They dont have any energy.
Their numbers are down.
Our number are through the roof.
And people are making the statements theyve never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized.
I think if somebody is doing as well as Im doing  and Im not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else  but if Im going to win five  Ive already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine.
It could be nine, could win nine states tonight.
If Im going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if Im going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that I might not win, I think, you know, were a democracy.
I think its awfully hard to say thats not the person we want to lead the party, right?
You know, its very hard.
But I really think that  I think its a great question, David, because I really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening, and everybody, is the Republican Party has become more dynamic.
Its become more diverse.
Were taking from the Democrats.
Were taking from the independents.
We have a lot more people.
We have a lot more people.
I mean, take a look at South Carolina.
Look at the numbers.
Look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote.
And then you look at  I was there and you had lines that went a mile long.
And it was virtually more than doubled.
So we have a very, very dynamic party and I think were going to be able to unify the party.
I hope to be able to get along with everybody.
I dont know Paul Ryan well but I hope to be able to get along with him.
I do know Mitch McConnell a little bit but I hope to be able to get along with him.
But remember this.
I have millions and millions and millions of people.
This isnt like its a close match.
I mean, its only too bad that winner didnt take all, because if winner took all, this thing is over.
Were just having a celebration.
You know, were having a celebration.
So anyway, I would like to  look, I just want to end by thanking everybody.
This has been an amazing period in my life.
My wife just called and Ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and shes a special person and its going to be great and we look forward to that.
Shes back in New York.
She wanted to be here.
They all wanted to be here but theyre with Ivanka now and that could be, certainly, within the next week.
But this this has been an amazing period of time.
Its been amazing for me, even from an educational standpoint.
And I think, honestly, weve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and Im very proud of it.
And I just want to leave you with this.
I am a unifier.
I would love to see the Republican Party and everybody get together and unify.
And when we unify, theres nobody, nobody thats going to beat us.
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
SPEECH 8


This is so  so incredible.
We  we have had, no matter where we go  you know, its a movement, folks.
This is a movement.
No matter where we go, its amazing.
We go to Dallas.
We go to Oklahoma.
We go all over.
We went to, the other night, Iowa  packed.
Every place  New Hampshire, packed.
Every place we go to, its like this.
Its amazing.
And just great, great people.
And they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, "go home."
Well come back.
Well do another one.
But they had to go home.
Would you like to leave and well let them come in?
No?
I dont think so, but we  they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually.
So maybe next time.
I dont know.
I think this is the largest room.
I know its a record for the room.
You know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and theyre standing.
Theyre not sitting.
So thats great.
I love  we love setting records.
We want the country to set records, right?
So, you know, I  I do this, and I love to do it.
And I talk about our success because thats ultimately what its all about.
I think were going to do fantastically well in Iowa.
I really think were going to do great there.
And I could say, "Oh, gee, if we came in the top four of five."
Im not  Im looking to win everything.
We want to run the table.
We want to run it, because that sends a signal.
And, you know, weve been a little bit  we had to respond to Hillary.
She came out with that  she came out  remember, she wrote  she said, "Hes got a  hes demonstrated a penchant"  I demonstrated  "a penchant for sexism."
Can you believe it?
Me?
Nobody respects women more than Donald Trump.
That I can tell you.
And, you know, when she said that, I had no choice, because I didnt start it.
I had no choice.
And I did have to mention her husbands situation.
OK?
(Laughter)


And that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10.
So, we have to do it.
You cant let people push you around.
You cant let people tell lies.
You cant do it.
You know, its interesting.
One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if its Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country.
I can see that.
I can see it.
And they said all of these people that are going to come in new, that never vote  they never vote, they dont care  theyre going to mostly  Ill tell you what, theyre going to vote for Trump.
Thats why theyre coming in, because theyre so fed up with the system  this corrupt, horrible system.
Theyre fed up with it and theyre fed up with those guys back there, the media.
TRUMP: They are the worst.
No, no, no.
Theyre fed up.
Theyre fed up with the media.
I mean, Ive got  and you know, not all bad, but theres so much dishonesty in the media.
And I like to call it out.
And one of the things thats really been amazing to me, and such  its been so beautiful to watch  the level of genius in the public.
They get it, you know?
They really get it.
They want to marginalize us, they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, "Oh, gee."
The level of genius  they fully understand.
They know theyre crooked, they know theyre dishonest and they really  otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me?
(Laughter)


And yet, I see a poll at 42 percent.
And you know, youre talking about 15, 16 people, started with 17.
How are you?
Started with 17 people.
And you know, Id be happy with 42 if we had three, OK?
Not thrilled, Id like to be that  over that 50 mark, but I think were doing really well.
And you know, its interesting, but the debates  OK.
So the debates  thank  I love you too, darling.
(Laughter)


I love you.
I do.
I love you.
I love every  you know what?
The rooms, no matter where, whether its stadiums or big ballrooms like this one, its amazing, and theres love in the room.
And I told  the other night, I said and a friend of mine, very, very successful guy who I would love to have negotiating against China.
Thats what we need, not these hacks that we have.
No, no.
I have guys ...






Carl Icahn endorsed me.
Great business man.
We have  I have great, great business people that want to be involved.
And were going to use  we have the best.
We have the best in the world.
We dont use them.
We use political hacks, we use special interest people that really dont care about the country, they care about their deals.
This is going to change so fast.
You know, last year, $500 billion trade deficit with China.
Think about it.
You know what $500 billion is?
You do  you do $100 bills, you would fill the room to the ceiling, $500 billion deficit  trade deficit with China.
What are we?
Are we  yes, I guess the answer is certainly lets not blame us.
Our leaders are stupid and  and/or  you have to say and/or they have deals, because whats happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do  our leaders, can you believe our leaders?
This is what  but they make the leaders of our country do things that they dont even want to do because theyve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.
I look at this guy Jeb Bush.
He spent $59 million on his campaign and he is down in the grave.
He is nowhere.
No, no.
Think of it.
Its got to be much more than that.
It was actually $59 million a while ago.
Every time I turn on an add, I see an ad about Trump.
I mean, its not that bad an ad either.
Its like  you know.
If youre going to do an ad, do an ad.
But hes a low-energy person.
Lets face it.
We dont need low-energy.
We need lots of energy.
But he spent  think of it.
Think of it.
He spent $59 million.
I spent nothing, right?
Nothing.
Now, Im going to be spending.
You probably saw Im going to spend  now, were going to start spending a lot of money because I dont want to take any chances.
You know, its  I love getting up  and for the last couple of months, I have been leading from practically the time I announced, right?
And for the last  and leading a lot.
Im going to go over that because I go over (ph) polls.
I love polls.
I love polls.
Now, when they  if they turn negative, I dont like them.
And I promise, if they turn negative, Im not going to be talking about them.
In fact, I get criticized all the time.
Youre always talking about your polls.
One of these guys just got two.
Hes at two.
Im at 42.
And one of these guys whos at two said, "He always talks about his polls and I dont."
I wouldnt either if I had two, I swear I wouldnt.
I wouldnt.
I wouldnt do it at all.
But you know, I love to tell the story where I have spent nothing and Bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that.
Thats just  you know, because I see since then  I mean, just  you cant turn on this television without these commercials.
And Fox  every two minutes its a commercial on Trump.
You know what he did?
Its false advertising.
So I killed him in the debate.
According to Reuters, according to everybody, Drudge, whos an amazing guy, by the way.
If you dont know Drudge  Matt Drudge.
Right?
Hes a great guy.
But Drudge, 46 percent.
At 46 percent, you have 15 people.
Now, if you noticed a couple have dropped out.
A couple or more.
But 15, 16 people  46 percent.
Time magazine, 49 percent.
Think of it.
Slate, 51 percent.
U.S. News and World Report  69 percent said I won the debate.
I wont the debate, right?
PBS, Public Broadcasting System  69 percent said Trump won.
No, you know, it is amazing.
We have Washington Times at 62 percent.
CBS, 59 percent.
Fox, 62 percent  Fox Las Vegas, 62 percent.
So, they all say  then they go back home, after the debate.
I like to see how did I do?
Did I look good?
Looking good is very important, right?
Sometimes, it is not as much like what you say, its how did you look?
Oh, I looked good, didnt sound too good, but that is OK. You wonder if that is a good trait.
But I go home, and I watch, and the pundits will say  and they cant totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know whats happening  well, Mr. Trump was OK tonight.
He was  I won every single online poll, I won.
And then, heres Bush.
So, Bush does an ad.
And he takes me  and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage  and then I killed him.
I mean, he  by the way, I met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got.
He came in last.
He takes the ad  and I shouldnt even talk about him.
Hes down to two or three  I  but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right?
I say, why is he doing this?
Doesnt he have something better, he should go home.
Just relax.
You know, honestly, he should go home and relax.
He shouldnt be wasting his time.
But it does.
I say, why is this guy spending all this money?
Now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys, they were also very weak and somewhere  but here is my ad.
So, he made a statement, and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great.
He took on Trump, he took on Trump.
Im standing here, hes over here.
Took on Trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster.
You know?
So, he would remember (ph) it.
He said, "Mr. Trump, why dont you this?"
I said, OK. Then I gave him an answer.
I said, "Jeb, Im at 42, you are at 2.
Right?
It is a simple answer.
You started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage.
Right?
No, no, its true.
And then  and then  and that was it.
And so I responded.
So, he asked me a question, question was fine.
You know, professionally written.
So, he asked me a question, good.
I give him an answer, I blow him away.
Right.
Everyone says Trump won the debate.
Everybody.
And hat is it.
So, the ad is him asking the question and Im standing there like this, because I havent  in fact, you see in one of them, Im just about ready to open my mouth.
But he doesnt let me respond.
That is almost false advertising, isnt it?
You know?
So, I mentioned it, Hillary is a disaster.
I mean, Hillary.
Hillary is controlled by her money.
So is Jeb.
So is  by the way, Im the only one self-funding my campaign.
Im self-funding.
You know, one of the things that makes me happy.
I heard one of my commentators this morning, said, "you know, Ive been watching this stuff for 50 years and Ive never seen anything like what has happened with Trump.
One of them actually said  one of them  Im special.
Youre special.
I like you.
Im special.
Isnt that nice?
Thats a very  every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you.
Where are you?
Who said that?
Wow.
So nice.
Thank you.
That is a nice one.
Thats like, you know, very once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal.
I think low-energy was a brutal statement, right?
Low-energy can be applied to Hillary.
I just dont like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies.
Right?
Because I consider them enemies.
We view this as war.
Dont we view this as war?
Its war.
Its war.
And so, you dont like to use it.
I hate to give it up.
What?
How are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?
Oh, we are going to help your daughter.
We are going to help the country, thats called helping the daughter.
We are going to help your country.
So, here is the story.
So, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared.
General Odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember.
And I think he went back tot he beginning, but lets say second World War.
OK?
Thats enough.
And we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us.
She has done a terrible job as secretary of State.
Think of it.
Putin comes out, he said, Donald Trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack.
OK, thats nice.
And she and my opponents  oh, isnt it terrible that Putin said  wouldnt it be nice if we could get along with the world?
Wouldnt it be?
Seriously.
No, no, wouldnt it be nice?
I mean, they want me to refute his statement.
How dare you say Im brilliant?
How dare  thats  whos going to do that?
And by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy.
But the point is, we have to get along.
The world has blown up around Barack Obama.
Now, I dont know if you saw his recent release.
They were talking about the Department of State, State Department, and they said very strongly, you know, the things that theyve done.
Well, they couldnt find it because what have they done thats good?
And they said bringing peace to Syria.
Did you see that?
So instead of saying they made a mistake  call it a typo, they made a mistake  theyre trying to justify it.
Well, we meant were working on it.
Can you believe  bringing peace to Syria.
The world is blowing up, the migration in Syria  they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to Syria, and the whole worlds talking about it.
Its  the level of stupidity is incredible.
Im telling you.
I used to use the word incompetent, now I just call them stupid.
I went to an Ivy League school, Im very highly educated.
I know words, I had the best words.
I have  but theres no better word than stupid.
Right?
There is none.
There is none.
Theres no  theres no  theres no word like that.
So we are going to turn things around.
But  and if we have Hillary  Ive got to tell you.
I just saw where for the last week shes been hitting me really hard with the women card, OK?
Really hard.
And I had to say OK, thats enough, thats enough.
And we did a strong number.
Shes not going to win.
Any by the way, I love the concept  I love, love, love having a woman president.
Cant be her.
Shes horrible.
Shes horrible.
And you know really dont  Ill tell you who does not like  yeah, well get Ivanka.
Good.
Lets do Ivanka.
But Ill tell you who doesnt like Hillary are women.
Women dont like Hillary.
I see it all the time.
And always so theatrical; Mr. Trump said this and that and this.
And you just  I actually  I shouldnt do it.
I just have to turn off the television so many times.
She just gives me a headache.
But you know  although I think last night I gave her a big headache.
I can imagine  I can imagine those discussions.
But you have to hit back hard, and you cant let them push you around.
And today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name.
You know, in the debate I was mentioned nine times, I mean everything.
All of them.
But her.
I was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned.
And then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense.
And  but shes playing that card.
And then I had to hit her back, so I hit her back and I talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse  no, its tremendous abuse.
I mean, you look at it, its tremendous abuse.
And I talked about that.
And now today, the television is going crazy, and she gets up, makes a speech and doesnt even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else.
I wonder why  I wonder why.
And remember this; its really important.
A poll just came out where were tied, another one came out a couple of weeks ago, Fox, where Im leading by four or five points against her individually.
Were doing great.
I havent even focused on her yet.
Look at the people Ive focused on.
I dont want to really knock them, I dont want to mention their names.
But, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me.
Wouldnt it be nice if our country could have that same thing?
You attack and theyre, boom, gone.
And if we could do it verbally 






 you know, if we could do it verbally thats even better, right?
You know, who wants to use our military?
By the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever.
Ever.
Ever.
And were going to take care of our vets, were going to take care of our vets 






 And it will cost you much less money, and it will be great.
I mean, you are signing in programs, things that you will never, ever use, You know that.
And you are paying for it.
And you will never ever use them.
So we will get that straightened out.
We are going to straighten a lot of things.
We are going to straighten out Common Core.
Common Core is dead.
Its going to be dead.
When I look at parents and I see local parents in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, I went to a school and I saw the parents, they love their children.
They want that  they want education.
They love  they dont care about money, they dont care about anything.
They love their children and its local.
And they get together and they do wonderful programs.
They are smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big, fat checks in Washington.
I mean, we have such talent in this country and we dont use it.
So, Obamacare, dead.
Common core, gone.
We are going to get rid of it.
Department of Education, we are going to get rid of it.
We are bringing education to a local level.
One thing on education.
So, in the world, we are ranked number 28.
There are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things.
And yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far  there is nobody close.
Number two isnt even close.
So we spend more money for pupil than any country in the world and we are ranked number 28 which is way down at the bottom, essentially.
I mean, its  can you imagine we are ranked number 28 and we are number 1?
And thats what I do like saying about my campaign, I spent less money than anybody else and I have the best results.
Im number one by a lot and I spent no money.
I mean, my plane cost me some money, but I spent no ads.
Took a little radio ad in Iowa.
But I didnt do that  I took  I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth.
But I spent essentially no money.
And then you have all these other guys spending vast  and they like the way the United States is run.
Now, why would we put a guy like Jeb, like some of the others.
Its not only Jeb Bush.
They spend money.
I see Rubio on the ads all day long.
You know, the black background.
Hes got like a black thing.
He should have put something like that behind him, right?
Right there, the flag.
No, no.
And I like him.
I think he is a nice guy.
But I see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber.
Its not  I dont think its good.
So, think of it.
I spent no money and Im number one.
Others spent  they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not even in the race.
Thats what we need for our country.
What?
OK. Ive got 15,000, I dont know what the hell he means by that but thats OK.
So, but I think hes a fan.
I dont think hes a  are you a protester?
No.
OK. No body likes Trump.
OK. Hes not a protester.
I love you.
You know, the only time  dont worry about it.
The only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester.
Cause I always have  like, look at this room, packed.
I always have the biggest crowds.
And I go home and my wife said were there many people?
I watched you on television tonight.
I said, I had 20,000 people.
She said, they didnt show it.
They have it right on your face.
So I have 20,000 people.
I have 20,000 in Oklahoma, 35,000 in Mobile, Alabama.
Nobody knows.
Because those cameras stay right in your face and I think they cant move.
You know, I think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe  except every time there is a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they are on drugs or something, cause some of those guys, its like.
They dont even know what the hell they are doing there, all the sudden, the cameras swerve and make perfect shots.
And I like it because then it shows how big the crowds are.
So, you know.
Some time I think Im going to put in some false protesters.
Ill put in some friendly protesters.
Its the only way Im going to be able to get the crowd in.
So when we started, I talked about trade.
I talked about the border.
I talked about a lot of things.
And I started on June 16th and  in Trump Tower, the famous escalator ride.
And it takes guts to run for president.
Ill tell you, you know, its like, Ive never did this before.
And, you know, then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate.
We have the largest audience in the history of cable television.
Then CNN a couple of weeks later had 23 million.
Fox had 24 million.
CNN had 23 million  the largest audience in the history of CNN.
Now, theyre there  the cameras are on live right now.
I mean, you know.
So, the largest audience in the history of (inaudible).
Now, the debates used to be, if you go back four years or eight years, you know, whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted  they didnt want the debates.
I think they were forced to take them for licensing.
Nobody wanted the debates.
They drew nothing, but now theyre drawing 24 million.
Now they want to have more debates  "Oh, can we have more?
Can we have more?"
Can they go three hours?
Do you remember when they had the one go three hours?
I said, no, Im not doing three hours.
Its too long.
Who wants  I could stand up here for 50 hours, but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff, right?
"Mr. Trump, you have 30 seconds.
What would you do about ISIS?"
Oh, great.
And by the way, that question  I hate those questions.
You know why?
Because I want to be unpredictable.
I dont want to tell ISIS what Im going to do to knock the hell out of them.
Remember, I said very strongly  (inaudible) the oil for what, four years?
Youve been watching.
I mean, four years.
Ive been "get the oil, get the oil, get the oil."
Because whos going to get the oil?
Iran is taking over Iraq.
We made a deal for Iran, done by some of the dumbest people on earth, on our side.
We gave them everything.
They  we dont even get our prisoners back.
And now Iran wants to start negotiating separately for them.
Can you believe it?
I go crazy.
We would have gotten them back.
All you had to do was say, "We want our prisoners back."
They would have said no.
I would have said, "I want them back; you dont understand me.
I want them back."
They would have said, "No, we wont do that."
I would have said, "Bye-bye," and I would have left.
Then I would have doubled up the sanctions.
And I guarantee you...






...
I guarantee you that within 24 hours, they would have called back and theyll say, "Youve got your prisoners; can we talk?"
And I would have never given them $150 billion.
I would have never given them the money.
I would have never give  theyre using it  they dont have to make nuclear.
They can buy it.
Why are they going to make it?
Then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections.
How about the area  you know, the big area?
They dont want us there.
Oh, I wonder why.
They dont want us there.
So they self-inspect, OK?
Then they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty.
"We think youre making nuclear weapons here."
"Well, let us go check, Mr. President, well check."
"No, sir, were not making nuclear weapons.
Nobody  no, were not; we would never do a thing like that."
These are people that have deceived us.
Theyve lied to us.
Theyre a terrorist state.
But  and I used to say its the worst deal that Ive ever seen negotiated.
And by the way, just to finish prisoners.
So theyd come back; we get our prisoners.
But then when I hear the other day that now this deal is done.
Its all done.
And now I hear they want to negotiate to get  and what do they say?
They said very strongly, they said, "We are going to want a lot for the prisoners.
Thats out  were starting off; were going to want a lot."
Now, weve already taken off the sanctions.
Theyre already rich as hell.
What  whats going on there?
Thats why I say, I mean, some people say its worst than stupidity.
Theres something going on that we dont know about.
I mean, honest.
And you almost think  Im not saying that, and Im not a conspiracy person.
As you said, "We are; were saying it."
Half the people in this room are saying it.
Im trying to be  you know, Im just hoping theyre just stupid people, OK?
Which they are.
Or theres something going on.
Because its  its inconceivable.
You know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it cant be  that nobody can do what they did, right?
Nobody.
So, Iran now wants to negotiate separately for the (inaudible).
In other words, that deal is done; now we want to start all over again.
And they want a lot.
"We want a lot."
And I just  I want to just shoot the television, you know?
Because they would have had it just by saying.
And, you know, when they asked Kerry and Obama, the deal was made.
Everybody knows its a horrible deal.
Its going to need to  its going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation, and theyre so rich now.
You know, they became  $150 billion  they became so rich.
And many other things that you dont even know about.
Most people dont even know what the agreement says.
But Ill tell you what, when you look at what were doing, were not going to have  if we keep going like this, folks, were not going to have a country left.
Were not going to have a country.
Were not going to have a country.
And were like a dumping ground for the world.
Were a dumping ground.
They want to take these migrants  the migrants, you know, and I feel terrible about the migration, caused by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
Theyre the ones that caused it.
They go into Libya.
They knocked the hell out of Gadhafi.
OK, so Gadhafi  they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people.
You know the ambassador was riding in a jeep, one of our jeeps, of course, a military jeep, holding the Libyan flag and you know, freedom, freedom, freedom.
And then gets killed by the same people.
So, we backed people that turned out to be far worse than Gadhafi.
Look at what we did in Iraq.
Look at what we did in Iraq.
I mean, what the hell did we get?
We spent $2 trillion, and that was as a year and a half ago.
I keep saying two or three, its a lot more than that.
We spent $2 trillion, we have thousands of deaths, and Im not even talking other side.
You are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions.
You have thousands of deaths.
We have wounded warriors, who I love, all of.
These guys are the toughest  these are the greatest people.
You know, these are the greatest people.
And then what happens?
We leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving.
So, I said, man, if Im the enemy, Im just going to go wait for 18 months right?
He gave a date.
We are leaving Iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time.
I said, Im just sitting there watching and Im saying, man, thats really stupid.
Because, believe me, the enemy doesnt want to be killed.
You know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?
They dont.
They want to live.
And they want to take care of their families, always their families.
You remember that, because their families know whats going on OK?
You think their wives dont know what they are planning?
You think their kids dont know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the World Trade Center?
You think they dont know?
They know exactly whats going on.
Remember that.
And frankly, I think they have more love for their familys lives than they do for their own lives, OK.
But they still want to live.
So here is Obama, gives an exact date.
He gives an exact date and so they pull back.
And everyone says, oh, we are doing so well.
Look, were doing so well.
Why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place?
So what happens?
So we have ISIS taking a lot of oil.
I said take the oil.
Remember when we left, I was opposed to going in because I said youre going to destabilize the Middle East.
Because you had Iraq and you had Iran.
And I said, they fight, theyre always fighting for decades and decades, for generations.
They fight, thats what they do.
They fight.
How we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe.
They fight and they were equal militarily.
They go this way, 10 feet.
They go this way, 10 feet.
Then they rest a couple of years, then they start fighting again.
Then Saddam Hussein throws a little gas.
Everyone goes crazy.
Oh, its because (ph) of gas.
They go back and forth.
Its the same.
And they were stabilized.
And I said, if you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, youre going to destabilize the Middle East.
Thats what going to happen.
Youre going to destabilize the Middle East.
And thats exactly what happened.
We totally destabilized the Middle East.
We have now migrations ,largely because of whats happened afterwards.
You know Iraq was horrible.
It was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in.
But we shouldnt have gotten out the way we went out.
And we shouldnt have given dates.
I mean, I would have probably said we are going to stay forever.
And they would have said, oh, man.
And then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy.
I mean, hes never going to leave and youll make a deal.
But when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back.
And then as soon as we left, they come in OK?
So they have the oil.
You know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right?
China.
Always China.
I love China.
I love Mexico.
Their leaders are too smart for us.
We have no border.
We will build a wall.
Mexico will pay for the wall by the way.
Were building a wall, we are going to have a border.
And people are going to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a legal process.
Theyre not coming in the way theyre coming in now, just walking in like nothing.
They are going to come in, but they are going to come through a legal process.
So, with Iraq, so we give them the date and they take over.
We didnt take the year.
So for four years, I have been talking about it.
Then because of Paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil.
But I didnt want to just bomb the oil.
I wanted to take oil.
Theyre bombing.
You know, we are bombing.
Great.
Whats going to happen after that?
So were bombing.
And, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it.
I said, how could they keep selling it?
Obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere.
No, this is serious.
Now think of it.
He talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old Air Force one, an old Boeing 747, with the old engines and you know, spewing stuff.
So, hes got a problem with the carbon footprint.
You cant use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone.
Im trying to figure out.
Lets see, Im in my room in New York City and I want to put a little spray so that I can 










 right?
Right?
But I hear where they dont want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which I really like better than going bing, bing, bing 






 and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you  its stuck in your hair and you say oh my God, Ive got to take a shower again.
My hairs all screwed up, right?
I want to use hair spray.
They say dont use hair spray, its bad for the ozone.
So Im sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit  you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right?
But its sealed, its beautiful.
I dont think anything gets out.
And Im not supposed to be using hair spray.
But think of it.
So Obamas always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK?
No, no, think of it.
I mean, even if youre a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russias a problem, Chinas a problem.
Weve got a lot of problems.
By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem.
He actually has nuclear weapons, right?
Thats a problem.
Weve got a lot of problems.
Weve got a lot of problems.
Thats right, we dont win anymore.
He said we want to win.
We dont win anymore.
Were going to win a lot  if I get elected, were going to win a lot.
Were going to win so much  were going to win a lot.
Were going to win a lot.
Were going to win so much youre all going to get sick and tired of winning.
Youre going to say oh no, not again.
Im only kidding.
You never get tired of winning, right?
Never.
But think of it.
So Obamas talking about all of this with the global warming and the  a lot of its a hoax, its a hoax.
I mean, its a money-making industry, OK?
Its a hoax, a lot of it.
And look, I want clean air and I want clean water.
Thats my global  I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air.
And we can do that, but we dont have to destroy our businesses, we dont have to destroy our 


And by the way, China isnt abiding by anything.
Theyre buying all of our coal; we cant use coal anymore essentially.
Theyre buying our coal and theyre using it.
Now when you talk about the planet, its so big out there  were here, theyre there, its like theyre our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe.
Miss Universe, by the way, I made a great deal when I sold  oh did I get rich.
That was a great deal.
You know, they broke my choppers on that.
They said he talks about illegal immigration, were not going to put him on television.
First of all, Univision is being sued like crazy; you wouldnt believe it.
And NBC, I made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal, far more than I would have ever gotten  I mean, I made an unbelievable deal  far more than I ever would have gotten if I said I think Im going to sell it if times were normal, right?
Isnt it amazing the way that stuff can work out?
But I love Miss Universe and I love the universe.
But think of it.
So China is spewing up all this stuff and were holding back.
And with China  you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years.
I dont think theyre going to be doing it.
Its like Japan.
If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III, OK?
If we get attacked, Japan doesnt have to help us.
Somehow, that doesnt sound so fair.
Does that sound good?
So South Korea  I order televisions, I order thousands of televisions a year.
I order televisions because I have a lot of stuff and I like nice brand new  theyre all made in South Korea, most  other than Sony, and Sony, in all fairness, has lost its way.
But a lot of them  Samsung, all of them.
I mean, theyre all pretty much  all of them, right?
I think just about.
But I order thousands of televisions, theyre all from South Korea.
So we have 28,000 people on the border separating South Korea from this maniac in North Korea, we get nothing.
What do  we get nothing.
Theyre making a fortune.
Its an economic behemoth.
A lot of you dont know we protect Germany.
Germany!
Mercedes Benz, how many people have a Mercedes Benz?
We protect Germany.
Its an economic behemoth.
We protect Saudi Arabia.
They were, during the good oil days  now its probably half, which is fine.
But during the good old  they were making a billion  listen to this  a billion dollars a day, and we protect them.
Our military  they pay us peanuts, like nothing.
And then if we want to buy  we want to move to another location, well, thats very expensive if we do that.
We want  they charge us rent?
I mean, look.
We are run by people that are so bad, theyre so out of their league  and I see it, I see it on the stage.
You know, theyre  a lot of them are nice people.
You know, a lot of people think I dont like these people.
I do like them.
But they dont have business sense, they dont have business ability, they dont have common sense.
Theyre politicians, theyre all talk, theyre no action.
When I say...






... folks, when I say, "Were going to build a wall."
Most of them say, "You cant build a wall  build a wall."
In China 2,000 years ago, they built the Great Wall of China, which is bigger than any wall were thinking about, OK?
The Great Wall of China goes 18,000 miles.
We have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles, because you have a lot of natural barriers, right, that are extremely tough to get across.
We have 1,000 miles.
So, China has 18,000 or 13,000 miles, and we have 1,000 miles.
We have modern cranes.
We have Caterpillar tractors  I want to use Caterpillar; I dont want to use Komatsu.
Made in America.
Even my hats, theyre made in America.
It wasnt easy to find a guy that could do those hats.
You know what Im talking about.
I see so many knock-offs of my hat, right?
"Make America Great Again."
I see these things that are out of plastic.
Theyre out of all sorts of crap.
Mine are made in America.
And honestly, they do a great job, but they dont produce as many as Id like because, frankly, theres a big  I mean, its amazing.
Those hats are amazing.
But I wanted to have it made.
And you know why I wanted it  I wanted it, anyway, but I also knew that as soon as the hats came out, and other things  we have a website  as soon as the hats came out, I knew the press would be calling.
And its true.
First hour when the hats were announced, I get a call from the New York Times.
"Mr. Trump, where are those hats made?"
I said, "America."
I knew it.
I knew it.
Because as you know, if I would have said China, I would have been in big, big trouble.
But theyre being knocked off all over the world.
I mean, I see hats  theyre like helmets.
I see them all.
But what are you going to do?
But heres the story.
Weve got to build a wall.
So when I talk and when Im up on the stage with these guys, these people  wonderful people  and a very nice woman, Carly.
Shes a nice woman.
When Im up on the stage with them, they think Im crazy when I say "Mexico"  Im saying, "Were going to build a wall; its going to be a great wall; its going to be real wall.
See this ceiling?
This ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall Im talking about."
Im talking about a van to get up there.
Theyre not coming down because its too dangerous.
All right?
Did you ever see what they do now?
We have these little walls.
They build ramps.
They build a ramp.
I say, "Wouldnt it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just..." And then they drive over it with jeeps loaded up with drugs.
Do you see this?
They build ramps.
There was a picture in Time magazine.
Its a ramp  a little ramp that goes over the wall.
So, they have a jeep  over, down, bump, make money.
We get the drugs.
Think of it.
We  "build a wall" is right.
Youve got to build a wall.
We get the drugs.
They get the cash.
No so good, right?
We dont like that deal.
Our politicians dont know  they dont know.
So when I say "Mexicos going to pay for it," these guys on the stage with me, theyre not business people.
They dont understand.
Mexico makes a fortune off the United States.
Number one, we give them a lot of money.
But in addition to that, theyre taking our businesses.
Theyre making  you talk about a trade deficit.
Ill tell you what, Mexico in a certain way is in a mini-version the new China.
Mexico is making an absolute fortune  peanuts, compared to the cost of the wall.
Lets say the cost of the wall is $10 billion.
Thats a good  I can do great job at $10 billion.
I think well have a lot of money left over.
Somebody else would  and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall.
People that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall.
You know one of the reasons they didnt build the wall?
Because of the Environmental Protection Agency, they couldnt get an environmental impact study approved.
Can you believe it?
Because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way.
Now, think of it.
In China, in the South China Sea, there were these low-level land masses that were covered by water, but pretty close to the top.
China sends in massive excavators and theyre (inaudible).
Theyre building military fortresses in the South China Sea.
And a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in China  hes a great guy.
Theyre great people.
Theyre fine.
Theyre just too smart.
I mean, the leaders are too smart for our people.
They wont be too smart when I put my people there.
When they call up, "Wed like to speak to the donor that is negotiating it."
"No, no.
The donor now is Carl Icahn.
Youre going to speak to Carl Icahn."
You know Carl  great businessman.
You have so many people  they call all these business people  call.
So, a friend of mine, so I call him, I say, "Youre actually doing that."
And then jokingly, I said, "How long did it take to get started?
Did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?"
He looked at me, goes, "I  I hope youre kidding when you say that.
They conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later, OK?
There is no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you are going to hurt the snail.
Youre going to hurt this.
You are going to  they are doing a big thing.
They excavated  massive, massive  take a look, massive.
The biggest excavation.
They are ripping the hell out of that ocean.
They are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it  and theyre building air fields and theyre building forts.
We couldnt do it because, just like I said for the law.
Legitimately, they could not get an environmental impact statement.
Now, thats probably not the only reason it didnt happen.
I heard their costs were too high.
With me, thats easy.
You know, Im doing the old post office or watch (ph) you (ph).
Im under budget, Im ahead of schedule.
Hey, look at the campaign.
The guys at $59 million and hes down at the bottom.
Im nothing and Im at the top.
Its the same thing.
I actually said  its funny.
The other day I got this great review.
They said trump is a great speaker.
The crowd is spellbound.
But he has one problem.
And Im reading, and I want to see.
The problem is, he speaks through the Applause.
In other words, like I say that, you applaud, I start talking you finish your Applause.
And you know why?
Because Im so excited, because we have so much potential.
Its true.
I dont want to wait for your freaking Applause.
We have  I have so many  we have so much potential.
There are so many things to do.
I dont really sort of want to wait.
I want to do it.
And I just noticed, I did it again.
You were getting ready to give a big Applause, because you like that, and Im speaking.
I killed the Applause.
But he is right.
But except, Im not a speaker.
What I am is a doer.
I get things done.
So, when the people up on the stage with me  and Hillary, Hillary doesnt have a clue.
By the way, you talk about low energy.
She has lower energy than Jeb Bush, which is hard to believe.
She does.
And Ill tell you and Ive been saying it.
And maybe its rude, maybe it is not.
But it doesnt matter.
We have a much bigger problem.
We have to save our country.
So, if Im rude and if people think Im rude  Im actually a nice person.
I have a big heart.
I want to help people.
I want to help the migration.
I want to do a safe zone in Syria.
I dont want them coming here.
We dont know who these people are.
They are undocumented.
And we should do a safe zone over there.
We should have the Gulf states  Saudi Arabia and these states they are not spending.
They have got to spend.
They have to pay.
You know, we are protecting them.
Were doing  they wouldnt be there for two minutes if we werent protecting them.
They have to start paying.
They are not taking anybody, OK?
How about Germany taking millions of migrants.
Can you believe what she is doing to that country?
And she was the person of the year and I wasnt.
Everybody said Trump was supposed to.
(BOOING)


Hey, what are you going to do.
I think she has made a terrible mistake.
We will find out.
Time will tell.
They have tremendous crime problems.
I think she has made a tremendous mistake.
But what I like is in Syria, with other peoples money, meaning the Gulf states and others and Germany and others.
Because, look, Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people.
Theyll give us the money.
We do a massive safe zone.
And then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I will probably be able to get it straightened out, I understand this now.
But once its straightened out, they could go home to their country, you know, to their area.
It is interesting, I have thousands of people that work for me.
Thousands.
And I have people that come from far  they are all here legally, dont worry about it.
I use E- verify.
But I have people  oh, they go and check.
These guys go check.
They went into the old post office checking everybody who walked their dog, are you hear illegally?
They said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds.
I dont believe it.
But, you know, it is possible somebody slipped  hey, we do have 11 million people in the country.
And it is probably a much higher number than that, OK?
It is probably a much higher number.
But we have to do something about it and we are going to.
So, I just want to finish by saying this.
Look, we have a situation that is out of control.
Our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world.
We are laughed at by the rest of the world.
And when I started this journey, and it is a journey, and I do love you people.
Youre amazing people.
And by the way, you are so smart.
A lot of times, they will say, well Mr. Trumps people are blue-collar.
I love blue-collar.
Im honored by that.
But they are not blue-collar.
We have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people.
They say the audience is old.
Its not older.
The audience is young.
The other night in Iowa, I told that, and I said, we have so many young people and the place erupted.
They are all young people.
We have an amazing thing happening, its just...






 Look, thats their way of marginalizing, not even me, they are marginalizing you.
It is disgusting.
But when I started this journey and thats what it is, its a journey and its a movement thats taking place.
Its a movement.
Remember the old days?
Silent majority?
Its not right.
Its a noisy majority.
People are angry.
Its a noisy majority.
These arent silent people anymore.
I go to people  you cant even hear.
This is an amazing thing thats happened.
I received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal, but thats OK. (inaudible) a couple of them, right?
But, a guy whos really respected, recently, and he said, "How does it feel?"
I said, "How does what feel?"
He said, "What you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States."
I mean, even CNN said, "Number one political story of the year is Trump."
You know what number two was?
ISIS  ISIS was two.
Id rather reverse it.
Let ISIS be one; let me be two, because I want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year.
Make me number one next year.
But this reporter, who is a great intellect, actually, and a very smart guy, very good guy.
He said  he said, "What youve done has never been done before in the history of this country."
Newt Gingrich was on a television show the other say, and said, "This is one the great phenomenons (ph) Ive ever seen in politics; nobodys ever seen it."
Crowds like this?
Forget it.
I mean, its only confined to this (inaudible).
Again, they sent 3,000 people home.
Can you believe it?
More than 3,000.
Its  its unbelievable whats happening.
Its beautiful whats happening.
Its beautiful whats happening.
But Newt Gingrich said hes never seen anything like this.
But he said to me, the reporter, he said, "never been done before."
I said, "Well, you know, its fine, but if I dont win, its just a waste of time."
He goes, "No, no, no.
What youve done is incredible."
He said, "Even if you dont win, what youve done is incredible; youve totally changed the landscape of politics."
No, dont applaud, dont applaud, dont applaud.
He said, "Youve totally changed the landscape of politics; its forever going to be different.
Your campaign  theres never been anything like it."
OK, he was very nice.
I said, "You dont understand.
You dont understand.
If I dont win, I will consider this"  and I mean this  "a total and complete waste of time."
I really do.
So  because were not going to do anything.
Its wonderful.
Oh, good, I had nice crowds.
Theyll write about me every once in a while; every two years Ill have a story, "Trump ran this rather good campaign."
If we dont win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we dont win, its a terrible waste of time, because youll have somebody else in there.
They wont be able to do what I do.
Theyre not going to be able to.
And even if you get one of these Republicans in, like, I didnt finish the  so, the wall.
When I say "Mexico is going to pay," they all laugh.
They all go "heh, heh, heh."
They think its funny.
Honestly, these are people  they think its funny.
Theyre laughing.
You know, lightly, like "Oh ho, thats so funny; ha, ha, ha."
Theyre going to pay for the wall, folks.
Theyre making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico.
The wall is peanuts.
Theyre going to pay for the wall.
But I mention it, now they dont laugh because theyre starting to agree with me.
And then the other day, one of the people said  it was Ted Cruz, who is a nice guy.
But he said, "Were going to build a wall at the southern border."
I said, "Look"  and my wife is sitting (inaudible)  where did that come from, right?
No, Teds a good guy.
But he said on one of  I think it was on Fox, he was being interviewed.
And he said, "Were going to build a wall at the southern border."
He didnt say Mexico was going to pay was going to pay.
He hasnt gone that far yet, but believe me thats going to happen.
See, theyre all trying to catch up with me.
Because when I did this stuff, it was very out there.
Now, Im the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to.
But what happens is  so Teds up and hes talking.
And, you know, routinely were going to have the border; were going to have this and that.
And were going to build a wall.
My wife is sitting there.
She says, "Darling, did you hear that?
He just said theyre going to build a wall.
Thats the first time Ive  you know, thats what you say."
She hasnt heard that from any other candidate.
OK.
So were going to build a wall.
Mexico is going to pay for it.
There are so many things were going to do.
But when I  when I started the journey, it was amazing.
I came down  it took courage.
I went down in to the lobby of Trump Tower, on the escalator with Melania.
I have never seen  it looked like the Academy Awards, the press.
We have a lot of press here today.
Theyre all live  look at all those live cameras.
So when I came down  when I came down on the escalator, we came down.
And I said, "Were going to do things."
And I mentioned illegal immigration.
You wouldnt even be talking about illegal  it wasnt even on the radar.
Nobody was talking about illegal immigration.
Is that right?
Now, its one of the big subjects.
And thats why  and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and Im so proud of it, CNN just came out with a poll a couple of, I guess a week ago  36 percent for Trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12.
So theyre way down.
But on the economy, they give me 55  55 percent.
Thats with 16 people at the time.
On the budget, I mean, I understand  the budget, the economy, I win  I win it hands down, all right.
But listen to this.
On illegal immigration, Im almost at 50 percent.
And on ISIS, likewise, almost at 50 percent.
So people want to be protected, they want to feel safe.
They need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts.
I dont want to be tough  you know, I know a lot of tough guys but theyre not smart, and theyre the  theyre the easiest.
You can be tough, youve got to be smart.
Lets start smart first.
Youve got to be smart-tough.
Youve got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us.
So what happens is this.
I came out, I started  I did it, I was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and Mexico and all of this stuff.
Then Kate was killed in San Francisco and Jamiel was killed in Los Angeles.
Jamiel Shaw, an unbelievable young man, was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant.
Kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back.
So many great people.
And thats  these are two, so many.
And then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people arent paying taxes and all of this stuff, right?
And all of a sudden, people are coming over, and I say the wall and now theyre starting to say the wall.
We have to be progressive in our thinking.
When I say progressive, I mean like smart.
Im not talking progressive like a Bernie Sanders would say, the guy want to tax you.
Think of it.
Think of it.
This guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent.
No, no, think  youll have to move out of this  I love this area, by the way.
Ive been here many times.
Great golfing area, right?
We love it.
No more golf if Bernie Sanders  no more golf.
No, no, you wont have any golf anymore.
There wont be  you wont have any money left to be  youll be paying it in taxes.
This guy is a total disaster.
And Im not saying that  Ill tell you why.
You know, Hillary said well, Id like to run against Trump, believe me.
This poor Chuck Todd, Meet the Press.
His show is dying and he keeps saying do it, do it, but I never liked it.
You know, I just  he never treated me fairly.
So I do his show, he gets the highest ratings hes had in years.
He went from, like  believe me, I wont even give you the numbers, they were massive, the numbers, right?
I saved his life, and then he goes Hillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump.
And yes  and theyre looking forward to it.
Trust me, the last person  shes already gotten a dose last night, do you agree?
She had a tough night.
She had a tough one.
She had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant, OK?
So Hillary Clinton said  and heres Chuck Todd  and hes a nice guy.
Im not trying to knock him.
Please dont be insulted, Chuck.
But she says she doesnt like him.
But he doesnt treat me right.
So he goes the Clinton campaign said theyd most like to run against Trump, like Im some kind of a sap.
So I call him and I say Chuck, let me explain something.
When they say they want to run against me, that means they dont want to run against me, do you understand that?
Do you understand its reverse psychology.
They say they want to run against me  first of all, Im winning and tied in the polls now and I havent even hit her yet.
But look at what happened to all the guys I hit.
Theyre gonzo, theyre gone or theyre failing badly, OK, and theyll be gone soon.
But Hillary Clinton  think of it.
I say so Chuck, report it like properly.
Trust me, they dont want to run against Trump.
The last thing she wants in her whole life is  this was only  I did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husbands one of the great abusers of the world?
Give me a break.
Give me a break.
Give me a break.
So the last person she wants to run against is me.
Now heres the story.
Look, heres the story.
Its very simple.
So I announced  and I was talking about trade, I was talking about the wall, I was talking about the borders, I was talking about Obamacare, I was talking about the 2nd Amendment will be saved, by the way.
The 2nd Amendment.
It will be saved.
The 2nd Amendment is going to be with us if Im president.
You know, theyre doing everything.
They want to get rid of the bullets now, theyre doing everything they can 


Think of Paris, think of Los Angeles.
Think if you had some guns in Paris on the good side, right?
They had no guns.
Paris has the toughest guns in the world, folks.
And France  I mean, you get caught with a gun, its  the only one that has guns are the bad guys.
So they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind.
Hes a moron.
I mean, this guy was a moron.
I call him the guy with the dirty hat, right?
They got him so good.
By the way, the French police did a great job and our Los Angeles police did a phenomenal job.
They did a great job.
Wouldnt it be wonderful if, lets see, this guy right here in front of me, hes a tough guy.
This guy with the hat, with the lousy head of hair, but hes a strong-looking guy right here.
This guy right there, see?
And that one.
Wouldnt it be nice if they had a gun on their waist?
Somebody.
Him, him, him, so that when they  you know what they were doing in Paris?
Get over here, boom.
Get over here, boom.
Your turn, get over here, boom.
One hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals.
Other people are going to die.
Same thing over there.
These are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage.
Theres something going on, folks.
Its wrong.
They gave them a party.
They worked  they gave them a party.
She came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized.
And people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs  who the hell doesnt know?
Youre their next door neighbor.
And they didnt want to talk about it.
Youve got to report these people.
Weve got a real problem.
Youve got to report them.
No more nonsense.
They didnt report them, and the reason they didnt is because they dont disagree with them so much.
OK?
Believe me.
Its not because they were afraid.
You saw the one who wasnt politically correct to (ph) report them.
They didnt want to report them.
I mean, give me a break.
So we have to change.
So it started off with me where I was going to talk about trade, I was going to talk about all the things, I was going to talk about the military, building it up.
I was going to do all of this, but after Paris and California, and there will be others because they have no fear of us, but after Paris and California, it has totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points.
Its amazing.
They went up 10 points.
I said, "What, you think it was the debate?"
Because I did good in the debate.
They said, "No.
People view you as a tough cookie thats not going to take this crap."
Thats what it is.
And now I talk about protection.
I talk about  trust me.
The trade  thats so easy for me.
Ive got the greatest guys in the world.
Theyre going to come in, theyre going to do a great job.
Im going to do some myself.
I always talk about Ford.
Theyre going to built a plant, $2.5 billion in Mexico.
Thats not going to happen with me.
That stuff is  those deals are no good.
Fords leaving.
Theyre closing plants all over Michigan to build a plant in  in Mexico.
How the hell does that help us?
OK. Who are the people that think this is a good thing for us?
And in the meantime, in Michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place and theyre spending  think about a $2.5 billion  then theyre going to sell cars, trucks and parts into the United States, no tax, no nothing.
Ill say you dont have to pay a tax, folks.
And you know what?
Ford will say "If I (inaudible) pay a tax, were going to stay in the United States."
I mean, its very simple.
Its very simple.
How about two weeks ago, Nabisco announced a big  Chicago.
They announced theyre going to leave Chicago with one of their big plants and theyre going to move it to Mexico.
Whats my statement?
Were not eating oreos anymore, right?
No more.
But I dont want this.
Its not going to happen.
Then theyre make  theyre going to make product and theyre going to sell it into the United States?
Not going to happen.
Its not going to happen.
And by the way, Im a free trader.
I believe  weve got to be smart.
I mean, weve got to get something.
We dont get anything out of anything.
We dont get anything.
We lose on everything.
That Iran deal was a disaster.
By the way, think of the Iran deal for one second.
I always  and this came to me two weeks ago.
I dont know why I didnt think of it sooner.
Very disappointed with myself.
The Iran deal is the worst deal Ive ever seen negotiated, OK?
Im wrong.
You know what the worst deal is?
Irans a part of that one too.
We gave them Iraq.
Thats even better.
Think of it.
We gave Iran Iraq.
Iran has the biggest  think of it.
Theyre going to have the richest oil  if you go to Iraq, take a look.
Among the largest oil reserves in the world.
We gave them, by decapitating Iraq and then leaving, because frankly, once we did it we should have kept 20,00 troops or something, we give Iraq.
So not only did they make a great deal in terms of the Iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them Iraq.
We gave them Iraq, that theyve been after for 100 years.
We handed it to them.
So now, they have the largest oil reserves among  in the world.
Thats even better than the original deal.
I mean, whoever is representing Iran is doing a hell of a job.
OK?
If that was a stock, youve got to buy some.
So we are not going to have deals like that with me.
Its not going to happen.
Were going to become rich again, we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again.
And...






And youre going to remember this moment.
This is going to be an important moment for all of us.
The one thing I have to say and I have to ask you to do, go out and vote.
Its going to be your turn.
Number three.
Remember, it starts on February 1st with Iowa.
We go to New Hampshire, then we go to the finals (ph), so three weeks.
Weve got four weeks to go, and then we have three weeks after we start.
No matter what is going on in your life, you have got to out and vote.
Because if you dont, its not going to happen.
Dont sit back and say, oh, Trump is going to do well.
The more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense, because it is like a mandate.
But you have got to go out and vote.
And I will tell you this.
It has been an honor to be here, I love this area, I love the people here.
Its been an honor.

We're making a big speech tomorrow in Atlanta and then we're going right to Nevada.
And I think we're going to do terrific and the SEC's (ph) going to be very, very exciting.
We expect to do very, very well.
Very well ...
I want to just say thank you to my family.

It was so important to Ivanka to insist on being here so thank you.
Really good and Jared, Vanessa, Don.

He's very tough.
Tiffany, Eric, Lara and Melania.
Melania, say something.

M. TRUMP: Just want to say an amazing place -- South Carolina.
Congratulation to my husband.
He was working very hard and he loves you.
We love you and we're going ahead to Nevada.
And we will see what happen (sic).
He would be the best president ...






 And representing some very, very wonderful children, Ivanka.
Just say a few words.
I. TRUMP: Thank you, South Carolina.
This is an amazing, amazing night.
The momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that's because my father's message resonants so deeply with so many people.
So as our family we're incredibly proud.
We're incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us.
And I will say this, my father is an incredibly hard worker and he'll be working for each and every one of you.
So together we'll make America great again.
Thank you ...
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
So I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching.
And some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much.
But a number of the pundits said, "well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it's going to equal Trump."
But these geniuses -- they're geniuses -- they don't understand that as people drop out I'm going to get a lot of those votes also.
You don't just ...






 You don't just add them together.
So I think we're going to do very, very well.
I think we're going to do very well.
I want to also congratulate the other candidates.
In particular I have to say Ted and Marco did a really good job and they got -- they did quite well as I understand.
No, come on.
Just one minute.
Come on.
One second, right?
Good.
OK. We go back to war tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning we'll be back but I just want to congratulate the other candidates.
There's nothing easy about running for president, I can tell you.
It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious, it's beautiful.
(LAUGHTER)


 When you win it's beautiful and we're going to start -- we are going to start winning for our country.
We're going to start winning.
Because our country doesn't win anymore.
Doesn't win.
We don't win with the military, we can't beat ISIS.
We have great military but we can't beat ISIS.
We don't win on trade.
You look at what China's doing to us, what Japan does to us, what Mexico is just killing us at the border -- at the border and with trade.
Mexico is killing us -- absolutely.
We'll do the wall.
Don't worry.
We're going to do the wall.
We're going to do the wall and by the way, who's going to pay for the wall?
Mexico's going to pay for the wall and it's very easy.
The other politicians come down, "you can't get Mexico to pay for the wall."
I said, "100 percent."
We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico.
The wall is going to cost $10 to $12 billion, OK?
Believe me, they will pay.
One of the officials -- actually, one of the ex-officials from Mexico had a news conference.
And he announced that we will not be paying for the wall.
Who does Mr. Trump think he is?
They came to me -- the press.
These people -- look at all those cameras back there.
The press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall.
Do you have a comment?
I said, "yes.
The wall just got 10 feet taller."
It's true.
And I love Mexico.
I love Mexico, I love China, I love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incomptent and don't know what they're doing.
I love these countries.
They're great.
I have thousands and thousands of Hispanics.
We're going to Nevada.
I lead -- I lead with the Hispanics.
I'm leading in every poll with the Hispanics.
They love me, I love them.
The problem is -- the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it's Mexico or Japan or Viet Nam which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or China in particular -- that's the big one.
The greatest abuse of a country that I think I've ever seen financially -- China.
What they've done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world.
They've taken our jobs, they've taken our money, they've taken everything.
We're bringing our jobs back, folks.
We're bringing our jobs back.
We're going to bring them back ...






 And I know how to do it.
We've had so many -- we've had so many incredible endorsements and to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important.
Carl Icahn endorsed me, so many others have endorsed me.
And we're going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when China wants to come and negotiate, they're going to negotiate not with a political hack which is what they have now.
They're going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country.
So we're going to do a lot of beautiful work.
We're going to terminate Obamacare.
It's going to terminated.
It's going to be over ...
It's going to be repealed and it's going to be replaced.
And you're going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because Obamacare -- if you look -- look at the increases in your Obamacare.
Twenty-five, 35, 45, even 55 percent.
It's dead.
It's not working.
We're going to go to a plan that's going to be so much better and so much less expensive.
So second amendment by the way -- this is a room loves the second amendment.
Thank you, fellows.
This is a room loves and cherishes the second amendment.
We are going to protect our second amendment.
Totally ...






 Common core is gone.
We are getting rid of common core.
We're brining education to a local level.
The people in this community -- every time I see them they want education locally.
The parents, the teachers.
They want to do it -- they don't want bureaucrats in Washington telling them how to educate their children.
We spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world.
Not even close.
More per pupil -- second place doesn't even exist it's so different.
And yet out of 30 countries we're ranked number 30.
You have China, you have Norway, Swenden, Denmark and then you have number 30, the United States.
So we spend the most and we're at the bottom of the heap.
It's not going to happen anymore, folks.
It's not going to happen anymore.
We are going to build our military which I thank because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits in Washington I -- we love our military.
We love our military.
And by the way we love our police.
Our police are terrific.
We love our police ...
They are not being treated properly.
We're going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks.
And we're going to buy -- we're going to buy the equipment that our generals, our soldiers, that everybody that's in the know want.
We're not buying equipment that sells because they have political pull (ph).
Because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions.
We are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they're told to have by senators and congressmen in Washington.
We're going to have great equipment.
And the reason I can say that is I'm self-funding my campaign.
I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these ...
I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want.
That's not going to happen.
And we're going to take care of our vets.
We love our vets and they're being treated terribly.
We're taking care of our vets.
So we're now off to Nevada and it's a great state.
We have great people.
We have great people in our nation.
No matter where we go -- I went to Mobile, Alabama -- 35,000 people.
We went to Oklahoma recently twice -- 20,000 people, 20,000 people.
No matter where we go we fill up the arenas.
Over here the other day we had a 9,000 -- we had a 10,000 -- we have people.
The only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we can't get them in.
We have to send thousands of people away.
Time Magazine -- Time Magazine last year did an incredible cover story.
They said "it's a movement."
And that's what it is.
It's an incredible movement with incredible people.
Incredible people.
It's an incredible movement with incredible people.
I tell you.
And whether we go -- honestly whether we go to Dallas or whether we go anywhere you say -- you go to L.A. -- you go anywhere you say.
Our people are incredible.
And our theme -- what's our theme?
You know it, right?
Our theme which I love may be the greatest theme of all time, right?
And the word again eventually is going to come off.
We're going to get rid of the whole theme because what's going to happen -- make America great again, right?
And the last two weeks because I've gotten to see so many -- I guess millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches.
And I've met so many people.
But the people are so incredible that I've been saying make America great again and it's going to be greater than ever before.
That's the kind of potential we have.
Greater then every before.
I dont see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech.
Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:


"When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, theyre not sending their best.
Theyre not sending you (pointing to the audience).
Theyre not sending you (pointing again).
Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems to us.
Theyre bringing drugs.Theyre bringing crime.
Theyre rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people!
But I speak to border guards and they tell us what were getting.
And it only makes common sense.
Theyre sending us not the right people.
Its coming from more than Mexico.
Its coming from all over South and Latin America, and its coming probably from the Middle East.
But we dont know.
Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we dont know whats happening.
And its got to stop and its got to stop fast."
What can be simpler or more accurately stated?
The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States.
They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.
This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didnt want him in Mexico.
This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States.
In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican
government.
The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs.
The Border Patrol knows this.
Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border.
The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.
On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it.
But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally.
I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicansmany of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.
The Mexican Government wants an open border as long as its a ONE WAY open border into the United States.
Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.
I have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples great spirit.
The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours.
To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade.
I have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something Mexico doesnt want me to say.
In actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that Univision, previously my friend, went ballistic.
I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security.
I have lost a lot during this Presidential run defending the people of the United States.
I have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for President.
Macys, NBC, Serta and NASCAR have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country.
Univision, because 70% of their business comes from Mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the Mexican Government.
The last thing Mexico wants is Donald Trump as President in that I will make great trade deals for the United States and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.
Interestingly, Univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful IPO or high stock pricenot to mention that I am currently suing them for breach of contract.
Remember, Univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of Hillary Clintons biggest backers.
After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave "reviews"there was very little criticism.
It wasnt until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words.
If there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.
The issues I have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to Make America Great Again!
Additionally, I would be the best jobs President that God ever created.
Lets get to work!
TRUMP: (OFF-MIKE) This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know whats going on, and especially how poor shed do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism.
TRUMP: Even her former Secret Service agent, whos seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president.
There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech very, very soon.
But today, theres only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.
The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our countrys history.
So many people  its just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.
The horror is beyond description.
The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever.
Likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated.
We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.
We mourn as one people for our nations loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it.
I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack.
Thank you.
Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlandos LGBT community.
They have been through something that nobody could ever experience.
This is a very dark moment in Americas history.
A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.
Its a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.
Its an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity.
Its an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.
We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination.
But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly.
Were not acting clearly, were not talking clearly, weve got problems.
If we dont get tough, and if we dont get smart, and fast, were not going to have our country anymore.
There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left.
The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States.
His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who dont share its radical views, and they murdered plenty.
The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan.
The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.
That is a fact, and its a fact we need to talk about.
We have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly.
We have an incompetent administration.
And if Im elected president, that will not change, I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years.
We have an administration that will not change.
But if I get in there, its going to change, and its going to change quickly.
Were going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.
TRUMP: Thank you.
With 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore.
We have to address these issues head-on.
I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and I have to say many years but many are saying that I was right to do so.
And although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on.
We have to do it.
It will be lifted  this ban  when and as a nation were in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country.
Theyre pouring in and we dont know what were doing.
The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons.
Now, any class  it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States.
And its as he or she deems appropriate.
Hopefully its he in this case.
Thank you.
I will use this power to protect the American people.
When Im elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where theres a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.
After a full ...
Thank you.
And by the way we have no choice.
After a full and partial and long  really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.
We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.
Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.
Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American.
I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.
This is not just a national security issue.
Its a quality of life issue.
If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans  women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now.
We need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores.
And its coming ...


With these people, folks, its coming.
Were importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president.
Even our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people were letting into America.
All of the September 11th hijackists were issued visas.
Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.
The Boston bombers came here through political asylum.
The male shooter in San Bernardino again whose name I will not mention was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.
TRUMP: Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold  five fold in just one year.
According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law.
We admit many more, and thats just the way it is.
We admit many more from other countries in the region.
And Ill tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values.
We want to remain a free and open society.
Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders.
We have to control, and we have to control them now, not later.
Right now.
Thank you.
Yet Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday.
And, guess what, she will probably say them.
She sort of has said them, but lets see what happens.
She really has no choice, but she doesnt want to.
However, shes really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words.
She supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and whats going wrong with our country and our borders.
She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is and she wont speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know.
Shes in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world  true weakness.
I dont know if you know this, but just a few weeks before San Bernardino, the slaughter, thats all it was was a slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words "radical Islam."
Here is what she said, exact quote, "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."
That is Hillary Clinton.
So, she says the solution is to ban guns.
They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood.
Her plan is to disarm law abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.
No good.
Not going to happen, folks.
Not going to happen.
Not going to happen.
Thank you.
She wants to take away Americans guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.
Let them come into the country, we dont have guns.
Let them come in, let them have all the fun they want.
I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.
I will be always defending the Second Amendment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into American and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing.
In fact, Hillary Clintons catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life.
When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss.
Its deadly  totally deadly.
The Obama administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information.
We need this information so badly, and he stopped it.
We dont have the support.
We dont have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their job.
They are not being allowed to do their job.
And, they can do it well  better than anybody.
We need a new leader.
We need a new leader fast.
TRUMP: Thank you.
They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.
I refuse to be politically correct.
I want to do the right thing.
I want to straighten things out and I want to make America great again.
The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if Im elected.
As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.
They dont have those tools now.
We need an intelligence gathering system second to none.
Second to none.
That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly.
I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense wholl know how to fight a war on radical Islamic terrorism.
And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now.
Its not right.
We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.
The Senate subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.
Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obamas Department of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.
These Departments refused to comply.
Nobody even knows why.
They refused to comply.
President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since September 11th.
So important.
The public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land, why are they here?
We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs, very simple.
We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.
Not complicated.
Every  and just think of this.
Take a look.
Every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases.
Just a single event.
And just one person.
Can you imagine what theyll do in large groups, which were allowing now to come here.
Truly our President doesnt know what hes doing.
Hes failed us and hes failed us badly.
Under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse.
And Ive been saying that for a long time.
Each year the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East.
Our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security.
In fact, Clintons State Department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.
Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country.
Tell me, tell me  how stupid is that?
This could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was.
Altogether, under the Clinton plan, youd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children.
Not only their children, by the way, theyre trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is and we dont know whats happening.
TRUMP: The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to screen.
Were not screening people.
So why dont we have an effective screening system?
We dont.
Were being laughed at all over the world.
The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.
The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term.
Wouldnt this be money better spent rebuilding America for our current population including the many poor people already living here.
We have cities, we have inner cities...


We have poverty all over and this is how were spending billions of dollars.
We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States.
We dont know who they are, they have no documentation and we dont know what theyre planning and we wont unless we have proper supervisor and proper leadership in which case theyre out of here.
What I want...


What I want is common sense.
I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.
Thats a choice I put before the American people.
A mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clintons radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests.
Thats all it is.
Weve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and weve got to do it now because later is too late  going to be too late for our country.
The media talks about home grown terrorism but Islamic radicalism and thats a very, very important term  a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you dont like it.
Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past.
But the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we dont keep on bringing people who add to the problem.
And thats what theyre doing.
Were letting all of these people  hundreds of thousands of people come in and all theyre doing is adding to this incredible problem we have.
For instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.
This shooter and amazingly in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth.
Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?
Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesnt share their views or values.
She cant have it both ways.
She cant claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress these same communities.
How does this kind of immigration make our lives better?
How does this kind of immigration make our country better?
Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values?
Why?
Explain.
Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?
TRUMP: I will tell you who the better friend is and some day I believe that will be proven out bigly (ph).
And by the way the LGBT community is just  whats happened to them is just so sad and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is a disgrace to that community, I will tell you right now.
Clinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country.
They enslave women, and they murder gays.
I dont want them in our country.
Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesnt support our communities.
All of our communities, every single one of them.
Americans already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on Earth, anybody in the world.
Four times more.
At least, because we dont even know whos coming in.
And we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.
Not surprisingly, wages for our workers havent budged.
In almost 20 years.
You wonder why we get the crowds, you wonder why we get this tremendous support, you wonder why Ive gotten more votes than any Republican in any primary in the history of the Republican Party?
Take a look at that.
Take a look at your security, take a look at the wages.
For 18 years theyve been stagnant, theyve even gone down.
So whether its a matter of national security, or financial security, we cant afford to keep on going like this.
Cannot afford it.
We owe $19 trillion in debt.
And no longer have any options.
Our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief.
This is not an act of offense against anyone.
Its really an act of defense.
I want us all, all of us, to work together.
We have to form a partnership, with our Muslim communities.
We have Muslim communities in this country that are great, and we have to form that partnership.
Now, the Muslim community, so important.
They have to work with us.
They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.
They know it.
And they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith.
I want to fix our schools.
I want to fix our bridges.
And our jobs market, were going to have it rocket again, were going to make great trade deals.
But I want every American to succeed including Muslims.
But the Muslims have to work with us.
They have to work with us.
They know whats going on.
They know that he was bad.
They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad.
But you know what?
They didnt turn them in.
And you know what?
We had death, and destruction.
Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens.
I want to protect our citizens, all of our citizens.
The terrorist attack on Pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault.
In San Bernardino, as an example, people who knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.
They said oh, "We thought so but we didnt want to use racial profiling."
Which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer, so they dont get in trouble.
We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.
We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.
We have to know, and we have to know fast.
We need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with.
We need to know, and we need to make sure, every single last person involved in this plan, including anyone who knew something but didnt tell us, is brought to justice, so when people know whats going on and they dont tell us, and we have an attack, and people die, these people have to have consequences.
Big consequences.
America must do more  much more  to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in Orlando.
TRUMP: It also means we must change our foreign policy.
The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before.
These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.
That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism not nation building.
No more nation building.
Its never going to work.
And by the way weve spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the Middle East and it has been complete and total disaster.
Were further away now than we were 15 years ago.
For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clintons war in Libya.
That mission helped to unleash ISIS on a new continent.
Ive said NATO need to change its focus and stop terrorism.
We have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism.
Since Ive raised that criticism and its OK. Ive gotten no credit for it but these are minor details  NATO has since announced a new initiative  front page of the Wall Street Journal four days ago focused on just that.
America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism.
Pretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War.
We tried it President Obamas way, doesnt work.
He gave the world his apology tour.
We got ISIS and many other problems in return.
Thats what we got.
Remember the famous apology tour.
Were sorry for everything.
Id like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solitarily with the people of Orlando who have come under this horrific attack.
When Im president I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside our borders.
Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, I dont care.
All Americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Were going to be tough and were going to be smart and were going to do it right.
America will be a tolerant and open society.
America will also be a safe society.
We will protect our borders at home.
We will defeat ISIS overseas.
We have no choice.
We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.
We will make America rich again.
We will make America safe again.
We will make America great again.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Good evening.
Thank you very much.
I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel.
I am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state.
In late 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City, and on Washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims.
I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.
In Spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the Grand Marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state.
It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel, many people turned down this honor.
I did not.
I took the risk and Im glad I did.
But I didnt come here tonight to pander to you about Israel.
Thats what politicians do.
All talk, no action, believe me.
I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother.
The only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.
My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.
I have been in business a long time.
I know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for America, for Israel, and for the whole of the Middle East.
The problem here is fundamental.
We have rewarded the worlds leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.
Ive studied this issue in great detail.
I would say actually, greater by far than anybody else.
Believe me, and its a bad deal.
The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has.
The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock.
And of course, theyll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.
The deal doesnt even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability.
Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years.
But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad Irans behavior is.
Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.
When Im president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran.
First, we will stand up to Irans aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.
Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if Im not elected President, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, thats why Im going to be elected president folks.
And we are leading in every poll, remember that please.
Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia.
Literally every day, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states.
Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and Ill tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets.
like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have.
Now theyre in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.
In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
And in the West Bank theyre openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorists home thats been destroyed.
A deplorable, deplorable situation.
Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East, and its absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.
Secondly, we will totally dismantle Irans global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.
Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world.
During the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents.
Theyve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home.
Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.
Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold Iran totally accountable.
And we will enforce it like youve never seen a contract enforced before folks.
Believe me.
Iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times.
Those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe, and maybe someday hit even the United States.
And were not going to let that happen.
Were not letting it happen, and were not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.
Do you want to hear something really shocking?
As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi, were the words "Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."
You can forget that!
What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew?
And heres, you talk about twisted, heres another twisted part: testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made!
The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate United Nations Security Council resolutions.
The problem is, no one has done anything about it.
We will, we will, I promise we will.
Which brings me to my next point.
The utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations.
The United Nations is not a friend of democracy.
Its not a friend to freedom.
Its not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know, it has its home.
And it surely is not a friend to Israel.
With President Obama in his final year, yay!
He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me.
Believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody.
So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Let me be clear.
An agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.
The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president, 100 percent.
When people ask why, its because thats not how you make a deal.
Deals are made when parties come together.
They come to a table and they negotiate.
Each side must give up something it values, I mean we have to do something where theres value in exchange for something that it requires.
Thats what a deal is.
A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something.
Thats not going to happen with the United Nations.
It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel.
It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel.
Its not going to happen folks.
And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day theyre stabbing Israelis, and even Americans.
Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenol young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian.
You dont reward behavior like that.
You can not do it!
There is only one way you treat that kind of behavior.
You have to confront it!
So, its not up the United Nations to go with a solution.
Its really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves.
You have no choice.
They have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway.
The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that dont even really know whats happening to Israel, to anything in the area.
Its so preposterous.
Were not going to let that happen.
When Im president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state.
It will be vetoed 100 percent.
You see, I know about deal-making.
Thats what I do.
I wrote The Art of the Deal.
One of the best-selling, all-time, and I mean seriously, Im saying one of, because Ill be criticized as though I say the, so Im going to be very diplomatic.
One of... Ill be criticized.
I think it is number one, but why take a chance.
One of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making.
To make a great deal, you need two willing participants.
We know Israel is willing to deal.
Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years.
You had Camp David in 2000, where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous.
Arafat rejected it.
In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer.
The Palestinian Authority rejected it also.
Then John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didnt even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America.
They didnt even respond.
When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One.
And when I say something, I mean it.
I mean it.
I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately.
I have known him for many years and well be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region.
Meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and hate the Jews.
It has to stop.
When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heros, little kids want to be firefighters.
When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars.
In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews.
we cant let this continue.
We cant let this happen any longer.
You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs.
Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace.
It is a horrible, horrible way to think.
Its a barrier that cant be broken.
That will end, and itll end soon, believe me.
In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, youve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, theyve got to go out, and theyve got to start this educational process.
They have to end education of hatred.
They have to end it, and now!
There is no moral equivalency.
Israel does not name public squares after terrorists.
Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians.
You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.
And you see that happening all the time.
That pattern practiced by the President and his administration, including former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way.
She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.
But its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America.
We saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community.
It didnt happen.
President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but its precisely the opposite that happened.
Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so its a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the United States.
Well get it solved, one way or the other.
We will get it solved.
But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially.
Thats what will happen when Donald Trump is President of the United States.
We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.
And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.
The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable.
They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel.
They must do that.
And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish State and it will forever exist as a Jewish State.
I love the people in this room.
I love Israel.
I love Israel.
Ive been with Israel so long in terms of, Ive received some of my greatest honors from Israel.
My father before me, incredible.
My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby.
In fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as Im concerned.
So I want to thank you very much.
This has been a truly great honor.
Thank you everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wow.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
Id like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey and California.
We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers.
Im truly honored by your support.
Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and were only getting started and its going to be beautiful, remember that.
Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another.
Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes.
This is a great feeling.
Thats a great feeling.
This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible.
Youve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.
Were going to do it.
Were going to do it, folks.
Were going to do it.
I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down  too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears.
Im never going to let you down.
I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and thats what it is, is a movement.
Now recent polls have shown that Im beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that shes made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially.
To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you.
I want to thank you very, very much.
To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support.
To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.
And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against and hes right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and thats what I do.
We are going to have fantastic trade deals.
Were going to start making money and bringing in jobs.
Now I know some people say Im too much of a fighter.
My preference is always peace, however and Ive shown that.
Ive shown that for a long time.
I built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always.
My goal is always again to bring people together.
But if Im forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.
Thank you.
Ive fought for my family.
Ive fought for my business.
Ive fought for my employees.
And now, Im going to fight for you, the American people like nobody has ever fought before.
And Im not a politician fighting, Im me.
Youre going to see some real good things happen.
Just remember this: Im going to be your champion.
Im going to be Americas champion because you see this election isnt about Republican or Democrat; its about who runs this country  the special interests or the people and I mean the American people.
Every election year politicians promise change.
Obama promised change and it didnt work out too well.
And every year they fail to deliver.
Why would politicians want to change a system thats totally rigged in order to keep them in power?
Thats what theyre doing, folks.
Why would politicians want to change a system thats made them and their friends very, very wealthy?
I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support, the only way you couldve done it  landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win; 37 primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.
After years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned  we cant fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently.
We cant solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.
Theyve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.
Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server.
Something about how shes getting away with this folks nobody understands.
Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a President in a corrupt system is totally protecting her  not right.
I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and were going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.
I think youre going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.
I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows.
Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund  the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese  all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return.
Its a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.
I didnt need to do this.
Its not easy, believe me.
I didnt need to do it.
But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family.
Ive traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in peoples eyes.
Ive visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and its horrible.
Ive embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldnt have been in the country  remember it, folks, remember it.
I visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.
Ive seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and Ive compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours its really not to be believed, hard to imagine whats happened to our country.
America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder.
Were broke, were broke.
We owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion.
Our infrastructure is a disaster.
Our schools are failing.
Crime is rising.
People are scared.
The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.
What a crowd, what a crowd.
Thank you all very much.
We love our country, we love our country.
But we can turn this all around.
Were going to do it by putting America first.
That commitment is the foundation for change thats been missing and its been missing for a long time.
Its important to understand what America First means.
It means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation.
It has to make us safer as a nation.
This is the opposite of Hillarys foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks.
We have made them that way.
You better hope Im President.
On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition.
Whats happening there is absolutely a disgrace.
No PPP, youre right about that and you mean no PP.
We are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, OK. We are only going to have that.
Were not going to approve, as somebody just said, the TransPacific Partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular Mexico.
If its not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it.
Its got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and were suffering bigly and its getting worse.
On energy policy, America First means opening up Americas great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this Administration.
On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and business; likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level.
We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.
On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or tenth generation.
No matter who you are, were going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like were babies.
The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together.
Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; its got to be that way.
Now, the people in charge say things cant change.
Im here today to tell you that we have to change.
We have no choice.
We have to change.
Were going to put America back to work.
Were going to make our own products.
Were going to put America back to work.
Were going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad.
Were going to take care of our African American people that have been mistreated for so long.
Were going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again.
Together, we will put the American people first again, first again.
We will make our communities wealthy.
We will make our cities safe again.
We will make our country strong again.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again, remember.
Thank you.
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you for joining me today.
This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.
Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.
There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.
But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.
The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our countrys history.
So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.
The horror is beyond description.
The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated.
Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.
We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.
We mourn, as one people, for our nations loss  and pledge our support to any and all who need it.
I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.
[SILENCE]


Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.
This is a very dark moment in Americas history.
A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.
It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.
It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.
It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.
We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people  with force, purpose and determination.
But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.
If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart  and fast  we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.
The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States.
His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who dont share its radical views.
The father even said he was running for President of that country.
The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.
That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.
We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.
We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.
With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.
I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on.
The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.
The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.
I will use this power to protect the American people.
When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.
After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.
We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.
Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.
Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.
I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.
Its not just a national security issue.
It is a quality of life issue.
If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans  women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people  then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.
We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.
We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.
Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.
All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.
Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.
The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.
The male shooter in San Bernardino  again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife  the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.
Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year.
According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.
We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.
If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.
Yet, Hillary Clinton  for months and despite so many attacks  repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical Islam," until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.
However, Hillary Clinton  who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage  still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and wont speak honestly about what it is.
She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.
In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam.
Here is what she said: "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."
Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns.
They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood.
Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.
She wants to take away Americans guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.
I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.
The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.
In fact, Hillary Clintons catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.
When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss  it's deadly.
The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement.
They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.
I refuse to be politically correct.
I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.
The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.
As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.
We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none.
That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials  and with our allies.
I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism  and who will have the support they require to get the job done.
We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.
The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.
Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.
These Departments refused to comply.
President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.
The public has a right to know how these people got here.
We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.
We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.
Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando.
Can you imagine large groups?
Truly, our President doesn't know what he is doing.
He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.
Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East.
Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.
In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.
Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.
This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.
We can't let this happen.
Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.
The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.
The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.
The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it.
Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.
Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?
We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States  we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.
What I want is common sense.
I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.
That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.
We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.
The media talks about "homegrown," terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.
Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past.
But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we dont keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.
For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.
This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.
Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?
Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesnt share their views.
She cant have it both ways.
She cant claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.
How does this kind of immigration make our life better?
How does this kind of immigration make our country better?
Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people herein vast numberswho reject our values?
Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words?
Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our countrythey enslave women, and murder gays.
I dont want them in our country.
Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesnt support our communities  all of our communities.
America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.
Not surprisingly, wages for our workers havent budged in many years.
So whether its matter of national security, or financial security, we cant afford to keep on going like this.
We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.
All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief.
This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.
I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities.
But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad  and they do know where they are.
I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market.
I want every American to succeed.
Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.
I want to protect our citizens  all of our citizens.
The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.
In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.
We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.
We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.
We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.
We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan  including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us  is brought to justice.
If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .
America must do more  much more  to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.
It also means we must change our foreign policy.
The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.
These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.
That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.
For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya.
That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.
I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism.
Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.
America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.
We've tried it President Obama's way.
He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.
I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.
When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders.
Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.
America will be a tolerant and open society.
America will also be a safe society.
We will protect our borders at home.
We will defeat ISIS overseas.
We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.
We will make America rich again.
We will make America safe again.
We will make American Great Again.
Thank you.
...Were doing really well.
Iowas been amazing.
Its been amazing.
Were doing so well and I love this place and Im back here all the time and Im going to be here a lot in January.
Youre going to be so sick of me.
Youll probably say, "We cant give  the caucus, just forget it.
We cant stand the guy any more."
No, youre going to like me and were going to be back and were going to do a great job for you.
Most importantly, were going to get to that office and were going to do the right thing.
Were going to do the right thing.
So, a few things.
A lot  so much has happened.
You know, when we first came out, we were all talking together.
And we were talking border security, which were just doing so great with the border security.
Were going to build a wall.
Mexicos going to pay for the wall.
We all know that.
But were going to have security.
And the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but theyre going to come into the country theyre going to be legal, theyre coming in legally, and thats the way.
Thats the way.
And it affects Iowa so much.
So we were talking about.
So we were talking about that.
We were talking about repealing Obamacare.
Boom.
Its going to be repealed.
Its going to be replaced.
I dont know if youve been seeing whats happening but Obamacare is a total disaster.
Its dying of its own weight.
And by 17, meaning hell be playing golf and Ill be working very hard.
But 17 instead youre not getting the people signed up.
Theres been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it.
Obamacares dead but well terminate it quicker than that.
And we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better.
Premiums are going through the roof.
Deductibles are so high that unless youre close to death, youll never going to get to use.
And even then I dont think youre going to get to use it really.
So, were going to take care of that.
And by the way, we have a lot of good people.
We have ethanol.
Nobody is really  we have the ethanol  where are the ethanol people?
Right?
I was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job.
I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but its so important.
And its another form of lets stay away from OPEC and lets stay away from that Middle East stuff.
Its so important...
Actually what I dont understand because the one guy thats doing pretty good with me in Iowa is Ted Cruz and hes a nice guy.
I mean, everything I say he agrees with me.
No matter what I say.
I was going to do one really wild but he agrees.
But with the ethanol, really, hes got to come a long way because hes right now for the oil.
But I understand it.
Oil pays him a lot of money.
Hes got to be for oil, right?
The oil companies give him a lot of money.
But Im with you.
Im with everybody.
Look, Im self funding.
I have no oil company.
I have no special interest.
I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, theyre representing countries that are ripping off the country, theyre representing companies that are ripping off our country.
All I do is Im going to be working for you folks.
Were going to do this thing together.
Were going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before.
So important.
So when we first started, I talked about China how theyre ripping us and Japan and Mexico.
Mexico both at the border and in trade.
Theyre taking so many of our companies.
Nabiscos moving there with their big plant.
Ford is moving there with a big plant.
They took a big plant away from Tennessee  a great state  they took it away at the last moment.
Im not going to let that stuff.
Were going to do what we have to do, okay?
But I talked about that...and I talk about it a lot.
The fact is that about 2.5 weeks ago with Paris, Im speaking a little bit differently now.
Believe me, I can take care of China in my back pocket.
Thats easy for me.
Thats what I do.
And we have all the cards.
A lot of people dont know.
You know, these politicians they dont understand we have the cards.
You know, with China, our people pay tax.
They pay no tax.
Its not supposed to be that way.
They call it a tariff because it sounds better.
But well take care of that.
Well take care of all of that.
What happened is with Paris, theres a different mindset.
And when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me.
Now, maybe it had to do  who knows why?
Who knows?
But my poll numbers went up.
And do you ever notice whenever theres something that I do thats proper but controversial, theyd say "Oh, now hes gone.
Thats it.
Thats the end."
I wont go over all of the different things because maybe youll change your minds.
But theyd say, "Thats it.
Its over."
And then theyd come in, "Sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week."
I said, "They did?"
Because I have to do whats right.
I have to do whats right.
And you know what?
If I dont make it, I dont make it.
I have a good life.
We all hopefully have a good life.
I have a great family, nice people, wonderful people.
They love me.
I think.
I hope.
I think.
But I have a great family and I built a great business.
...Theres such spirit...Theres such spirit no matter where I go.
You know, I go to Dallas.
We have 20,000.
35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama.
20,000 people in Oklahoma.
Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds.
You know this is supposed to be...for like a record.
It is big and yet it feels intimate.
It feels good...
...So I changed a couple of weeks ago.
When I saw Paris I changed.
And a big, big part of what Im doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness.
Sort of interesting.
You know, the slogan is "Make America Great Again" and Im adding "Make America Great Again and Safe Again" because we dont feel safe anymore.
And the problem we have now that weve never had to this extent is the power of weaponry.
Its the power.
Its the tremendous power.
You know, 100 years ago, I would have said "Lets not go."
I said "Dont go there" anyway.
And I said it strongly "Dont go.
Youre going to destabilize the Middle East."
But the fact is right now, were going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates.
And the press  look at all those cameras going all live, all  you know, nobody else has cameras like this.
They can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares.
Look at this.
And dont worry, they never pan the crowd.
You know, they never; they have me.
Thats why Im walking around.
I figured Ill walk around maybe theyll get the crowd.
They never pan the crowd.
I tell them "Pan the crowd", they never do.
...I had a crowd 7,000 people last week.
More.
7,000 people and in a confined space.
They had 3,000 people outside that couldnt get in.
My wife says, "Darling, the speech was excellent.
Did you have many people there?"
I said "What?"
She said, "Well, they never leave your face."
They keep it purposely.
But Ill tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you cant move them, right?
But every time theres a protester "Well, Im protesting" and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there.
Its true.
Its true.
Its true.
No, I used to think they couldnt move.
You know, maybe theres something with the crazy computers.
You know, in the old days everything was better right?
The car seats.
Youd sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button.
Bing, bing.
Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes.
Well, the same thing I figured with cameras.
I didnt think they moved.
I figured they were fixed for certain reasons.
And then I saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldnt believe possible.
So, theyre very dishonest people.
What can I say?
Not all of them but most of them.
Ill tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard.
The Des Moines Register is the worst.
They are the worst.
The worst.
No, theyre very dishonest.
You have some reporter named Jacobs.
She is the worst.
She will write  so  its such misrepresentation.
And so I dont care.
I mean, who cares?
So Im saying it right in their backyard.
Theyre failing anyway.
They probably wont be in business in two years.
I think theyre losing a fortune.
I think.
You know, its funny.
Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly.
...Im only doing this so they dont sue me but I dont mind if they do.
I hope they sue me because they dont have enough money to sue me.
Thats the good thing.
But I believe and I may be wrong  in fact, Ill say Im sure Im wrong but its my opinion that they dont do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people.
Ill explain it...You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket.
"Oh, Trump?
Oh, forget that one.
Forget that one."
Now, I dont know that they do that.
Do you do that, Des Moines Register?
But every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly.
I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls.
I dont know why.
But we had a great poll come in  CNN last couple of days  where were leading I think by 13 points in Iowa.
In Iowa.
And then we have another coming where were doing well.
But I think Des Moines Register has somebody says its coming out sometime.
Ill just tell you, watch  "Trump disappears!"
I think were going to do so well.
I think were actually going to even do better.
You know, were leading in most of the poll.
Were leading in every poll.
Except Iowa there was one poll  there was one poll, Monmouth  Id never even heard Monmouth.
What the hell is Monmouth?
What is Monmouth?
Explain it.
I dont like Monmouth.
You know why I dont like it?
Because they always treat me badly also.
But I only like polls that treat me well.
But were doing so well.
Nationwide, were leading every poll by tremendous.
We just had one in Georgia  44%.
44%.
Think of that.
Thats 44% with 15 people.
Id take 44% if we had three people.
I dont think Id take it if we had two people but I think Id take if we had three.
But 44%.
CBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and were at 35% to a small number.
Were killing everybody in every poll.
Just one little outlier here.
...Again, Im sure when Des Moines comes out itll be a negative because I dont believe that poll.
But we are going to win.
And Ill tell you what.
Honestly, Iowa is so important to me.
I could say, "Oh, lets not do"  I am an evangelical.
I am a Christian.
Im a Presbyterian.
Im a Presbyterian.
I love Billy Graham.
Franklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements.
Franklin Graham.
He was so incredible.
He came out  I dont know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump...He was so incredible.
Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, theres nobody, nobody that Ive ever seen  Billy Graham was unbelievable.
If anybodys gone to his crusades, they were incredible.
But so I think were going to do  were doing really well with the evangelicals...
And by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness.
Its true.
Not a lot come out.
But I like him nevertheless.
I think were going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals.
Were doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party.
And were doing fantastic with all the young and middle.
Were doing great with everybody.
And so its very important for me to win Iowa.
Now, I could put less pressure on myself and I could say, "Oh, I dont care about Iowa.
I dont care."
But I do care.
I do care so much about it.
Thats why were here all the time.
And then the lies happened.
You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much.
I said, "The people of Iowa cant be that stupid or the people of the country cant  ".
Im trying to make a point, right?
So I said, "The people of the country cant be that stupid."
Well, they cut the "country" out so its referring to Iowa.
I love you people.
Remember that.
Remember that.
I was talking about something, and I wont even mention what Im talking about because the guy Im talking about and was actually a very good guy.
But I will say this.
We want to win Iowa so bad.
Because if I win Iowa, I think wed run the table.
I really do.
I think wed run the table.
Wed go right through.
Because were leading big in New Hampshire  every poll.
Big.
Big in New Hampshire.
Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there.
Its the weirdest deal Ive ever seen.
And you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, "Are you sure about that?
Nobody ever called us."
They cant believe it.
And we can get into that but its irrelevant.
But were leading New Hampshire big.
Were leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers.
Were leading...Nevada.
Were leading in Texas.
Were leading everywhere.
Were leading big in Florida.
Now, you have Rubio  nice guy, by the way.
You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but youve got to vote.
When people put you in a position to be a Senator, youve got to go and vote.
You cant be the number one person that doesnt vote in the Senate.
Youve got to say, "Hey, Im a young guy.
I want to go and vote."
You should stay there a little longer.
Hes a good guy.
Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record.
But I dont know.
Hows he doing in Iowa?
Not too good.
Right?
Hes not doing well.
Hows Rubio doing?
Not good.
I mean, it seems like a two-person race right now...and its an important race to me.
So I just want to let you know its very important.
So with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say wed just go through.
I think well win virtually every state in the Union and its over quickly.
Over quickly.
...What about the Republican establishment?
The establishments got a problem, you know.
Its sort of like the fighters.
You know, the great champions.
Sometimes theyll go into the hometown of a guy theyre fighting and theyll say, "You know, wed never want to get a decision.
We go for the knock-out.
The knock-out is the knock-out."
Because you get a lot of bad decisions.
I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and its a decision and they say, "Uh, were in a problem" and theyd lose the fight that they won.
The only way they win the fight definitely  knock out.
So, if we win Iowa, I think were going to win everything after that.
So I think its going to show how important Iowa is.
...Ill pledge this to Iowa.
Even if I lose, Ill pledge it, okay?
I dont think Ive ever said that in my life.
If we go and win, Iowas staying right where it is in the chain.
Its not moving.
You know, theres a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment.
Folks, I win its not happening, okay?
Youre staying right here because its great.
Its great.
...Youve been paying into Social Security and Medicare, by the way.
Lets put them in.
Because Medicare does work.
With both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.
Were going to take care of that.
Okay?
But were not going to cut your Social Security and were not cutting your Medicare.
Were going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off.
Were going to become a wealthy country again.
And were going to be able to save your Social Security.
...I cant believe this number but I read it over  who is the man that told me the number  over 6 million people  I cant believe it  are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security...But I heard it.
I read it.
A tremendous  like 6 million people are getting Social Security.
Theyre dead.
Meaning somebody else is picking up...
...The press is going to have to check it because what do I know?
But can you imagine, we have 6 million  now, we know theres not 6 million, there may be one.
But theres not 6 million.
Anybody in this room 112 or over?
Because if they are, I want to shake your hand.
But  so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and thats the beginning.
So theres tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.
What were going to do is were going to save Medicare.
Were going to save Social Security.
Were not going to raise the age or were not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing.
Theyre all talking about doing it, and you dont have to.
Were going to bring our jobs back.
Were going to make our economy incredible again.
My tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and its gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups.
But we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated.
And when that happens, youre going to see an economy that takes off.
Were going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it.
But were going to get rid of it  you know, were at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right.
You know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasnt even a word anybody knew and now its like routine.
So we are going to save your Social Security without cuts.
Were going to bring the economy back.
Were going to make ourselves rich again.
A woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, "Mr. Trump, Im voting for you.
I love you.
But its very crude when you say youre going to make our country rich again."
I said, "I know its crude.
It sounds bad.
But many things I say are crude.
It sounds bad.
But we cant make our country great again unless we make our country rich again.
We cant let everybody in the world rip us off.
...We just did a big interview with CNN just before this.
And you know, Hillary  was Hillary missing today?
What happened?
She was two hours late.
No, did you hear?
Now, I may be wrong.
If Im one minute off, theyll call me because they love Hillary.
They love her.
You know why.
I dont know why.
Why?
Im trying to figure it.
No, I heard she was a couple of hours late.
Everybody left.
You know what happened?
She was sleeping.
Im telling you.
She couldnt get out of bed.
She was sleeping.
She was sleeping.
Was right.
...
Remember, we built China.
The money they took out of country, we rebuilt China.
You go there, they have bridges all over the  they have bridges like the George Washington Bridge.
Maybe I shouldnt mention that particular bridge.
But like bigger like the George Washington Bridge.
Only a few people got that one; thats okay.
But they have bridges going up.
We have rebuilt China.
Theyve taken our jobs.
Theyve taken our base.
Theyve taken our manufacturing all over the place.
Theyve taken our money.
Theyve taken our money.
Not going to happen anymore folks.
Not going to happen anymore.
Not going to happen.
I know the great business people.
We have the greatest business people in the world.
Guys like Carl Icahn.
He calls me, "Donald, I want to help.
I want to help."
The smartest people call.
Were not going to use the special interest guy  a donor.
We use donors to negotiate with China because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be.
Because again, Im the only one thats self-funding my campaign.
Everybody else isnt.
These guys  when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians.
They will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want.
Thats not going to happen with me.
So, Social Security  were saving it.
Medicare  were saving it.
Were going to make our country rich.
Okay?
Thank you, sweetheart.
...Yeah, its called the statute of limitations, right?
And you know its a six-year year statute.
Maybe five but its probably six.
But its a six-year statute.
Yeah, you have to look at it.
Look, Hillary Clinton  you know this story.
Its a crime.
She committed a crime.
Now, perhaps  perhaps  somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps...well have some really good Attorney General thats going to say "Well, you know".
Look, we want to be fair to everybody.
Okay?
Including Hillary Clinton.
But she committed a crime in my opinion.
Now, she shouldnt be allowed to run.
Shes being protected absolutely.
I have little doubt that theyre going to find anything.
But theyve already found it.
I mean, you watch television.
You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, "Yes, she violated section so and so".
Just one after another.
I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here.
Many laws.
You mentioned General Petraeus.
His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did.
Over nothing.
So I think shes going to be their nominee definitely.
The only question is whether or not shell be allowed to run.
Shes being protected by the Democrats.
Shes being protected by the President.
And thats why  why do you think shes going along with these insane policies of his?
Okay?
I mean, she goes along with everything.
I dont even  honestly in all fairness to her, I dont think she believes it.
But I think shes afraid hes going to say, "Listen, I dont like her anymore.
Go take care of her.
Im going to get somebody else."
Im telling you.
So, the question is statute of limitations.
Its a five year statute of limitations.
Shes got a problem.
Shes got a problem.
In one way, shes running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins thats the end of that.
Right?
But if she loses she could have a very serious problem.
...


...Well, I said right at the beginning.
Were going to build a wall thats going to be a real wall.
Thats going to be a real wall.
Its not going to be  you see that ceiling?
That ceiling is nothing compared to the wall.
And we can build it and we can build it right.
And it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look.
Its got to be beautiful because someday theyre going to name it the Trump Wall.
I know that.
Its going to happen.
Going to happen.
And its going to work.
And walls do work.
You know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago.
You know they couldnt get environmental impact statements.
Thats just shows you.
China is building in the South China Sea massive military bases.
Right?
Why?
Theyre not supposed to.
They have no respect for Obama or our country.
Theyre not supposed to be doing that.
And you could get them to stop just by saying "Were not doing business with you anymore."
Their whole economy would  you dont have to go to war.
Its economics.
The whole country would collapse in two seconds.
Believe me.
We have such power and we dont know it.
But theyre building massive  now, they had little islands.
They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars.
I think theyre using Komatsu from Japan...They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine whos Chinese from China  very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay?
I said jokingly "How long did it take them to do these massive islands theyre building right out of the sea?
Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything.
How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?"
He laughed.
He said, "What are you kidding me?
Nothing."
They say "We will build there."
About two seconds later, you have escavators digging.
So we had a problem with environmental  look, Ive won many environmental awards.
Im a big believer especially in clean air and clean water.
Im a big believer.
Just so you know.
Big.
And Ive gotten so many awards for the environment.
So I understand the environment; Ive won many, many awards.
But when you look at how were impinged and hurt.
But the wall was stopped because they couldnt get an environmental impact statement among other things.
They couldnt get an environmental impact statement.
Now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something.
You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake.
I dont know.
But they actually had people  a lot of people  people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldnt get it done.
...You know, I said bomb the oil, right?
Ive been saying that for three years.
Now finally they started  after Paris they started bombing the oil.
Ive been saying it for years.
You know one of the reasons we didnt bomb the oil?
Obama didnt want to hurt the environment.
Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding.
I thought a comedian was saying it.
It turned out to be true.
He didnt want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere.
This is the way we fight today.
Im telling you, folks, were being led by stupid people.
Were being led by stupid people.
Ive been saying not really bomb  Ive been saying take the oil.
I didnt want to go into Iraq.
But once we were there, I said "Look, we shouldnt have been there.
But then when we left, we left the wrong way."
First of all, we have a president who told them a date.
"Were going to leave on such and such a date."
What was it like 18 months later?
So the enemy all of sudden said, "Wow", cause dont believe it.
They dont want to be killed.
Okay?
They dont want to be killed.
So the enemy said "Theyre going to leave on a certain date?"
So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened.
Its a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq.
So anyway, I couldnt believe it when they said that.
When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces "We are sending 50 soldiers."
Okay, first of all, he thinks its a good press announcement.
Its not.
50 soldiers  thats not a lot even though theyre the elite.
But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart.
They have a target on their heart.
Why does he have to say that for?
Why cant he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth?
Why cant he just do that?
Why cant he do that?
Those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably dont even know that but everybody is looking for them and thats the way it is.
We have people that dont know what theyre doing.
We used to have General MacArthur  Douglas MacArthur  General George Patton.
I mean, these were real people.
These were real people.
Today, we have generals that go on talk shows...I saw a general the other day on a talk show.
He said  and this was serious and hes a good man.
Theyre good men.
But youve got to lead these men.
Even the generals have to have some power over them.
He said, "We are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that weve been in in decades."
And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us.
And he said we are in the worst shape weve been in many, many decades.
Now, number one, he shouldnt be saying that because youre telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that.
Right?
We shouldnt be saying it.
We shouldnt be saying it.
I mean, even if its true, you dont say it.
You get it fixed and you do the opposite.
One thing Im going to do Ill tell you, Im going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful  so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us.
Nobody is going to mess with us.
You know in many ways, its the cheapest thing you can do.
Everyone is toying with us right now.
Its the cheapest thing you can do.
The absolute cheapest thing you can do.
...Im a big Second Amendment person by the way.
...My sons are really great marksmen.
Theyre big believers.
And Im a member of the NRA but Im not such a good shot.
But theyre great shots so its one of those things.
But if you think about that question.
So you know theres tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets.
How about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine?
...So the people will put three bullets in.
I dont think the bad guys are going to say, "Well, I dont want to break the law.
Im going to go kill people today but Im going to put three bullets in."
Right?
These people  and you know I have arguments with them all the time and Im a practical guy.
Honestly, if I didnt believe this, I couldnt say it.
So in France or in California, I have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in New York.
Its very hard to get.
I have a license to carry.
But in France or in California or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in France hundreds of people in that room  Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world.
France has the toughest gun laws in the world.
Nobody has guns.
Except the bad guys.
So they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, "Over here  boom.
Over here  boom."
So they killed 128 but many more are dying right now.
Theyre in terrible shape in the hospitals.
They just wipe the place out and they couldve stayed there for longer.
They wiped it out.
Then you had those two sleaze bags from California.
The married couple.
I saw the press  "The young married couple that did the shooting".
Theyre not a young married couple.
Theyre the worst.
Theyre sleaze.
...They say "The young married couple".
Thats no young married couple.
So they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people.
But if somebody had guns in there  nobody had a gun...How would you have done if you had a gun?
Would you have been firing back a little bit?
Theyd been in trouble.
Right?
They would have been in trouble.
Believe me.
That guy.
So, you know, I went to like an Ivy League college and I have a lot of friends that are against guns and I argue with them.
I talk to them.
I said, "Okay, were in Paris.
You have all these places and theres hundreds of people.
Guys walk in with guns and you have no gun.
Dont you think they wouldve been better if they had?"
They cant  they lose the argument but they never change their mind.
So we have to fight for the Second Amendment.
Its so simple.
Its so simple.
And believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and theyre going to have them more so than ever before.
So were going to protect the Second Amendment if Im president.
That I can tell you.
And by the way, were going to be saying Merry Christmas again.
Do you ever notice?
...And by the way, Merry Christmas everybody.
Merry Christmas.
And happy holiday.
Frankly, I have a lot of friends that arent Christian.
They like Christmas.
Everybody likes Christmas.
Its politically incorrect to say Merry Christmas.
But when Im president, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, enjoy yourselves, dont eat too much turkey.
Right?
Okay, so were going to say Merry Christmas again folks.
Were going to bring that spirit back.
...I really do.
I like Ted Cruz a lot.
And hes doing well.
Im doing well.
I mean, its not a contest between the two of us, just so we understand.
We have to make that  but I do like him.
And I would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted, to be honest with you.
I mean, hes somebody that I can certainly see that because I like him, he likes me.
He actually put out a tweet tonight.
He said "Donald Trump is"  I think he used the word  "terrific".
Thats a nice word.
I mean, whoever hears that?
I can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me.
Right?
...
...So the Super PACs are horrible and I had many set up for me by people I didnt know.
I mean, Id see them on television talking about  somebody named one "The Art of the Deal PAC".
Two young guys.
They look good.
I mean, I dont know.
But then I got to be, you know, started going around and I see the corruption with these Super PACs, with the stuff towards money.
People that put the money in are dealing with the candidates.
The whole thing is wrong.
And I see it.
I mean, Bush has $125 million.
Think of it.
$125 million.
By the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldnt make any difference.
Okay?
But Bush has $125 million.
And honestly, hes a nice person.
He is.
I dont want to do that but hes a very nice person.
But its $125 million.
And youd say to yourself, "People give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million.
You know whats happening."
But some of the Super PACs are running campaigns.
Theyre actually running the campaign.
Another thing and its sort of interesting, one of the Super PACs I believe has $6 million.
Of the $6 million  this was reported on the front page of the Los Angeles Times  one of the candidates whos a nice person so Im not going to mention the name.
You know, when I like people I like them.
Im a very loyal person.
Of the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers  can you believe this?
they had $140,000 left for the campaign.
Thats better than being a real estate broker.
Id rather do that than sell houses.
$140,000 left.
That was in the newspaper.
I dont know.
I think I believe it.
But Ive seen it.
I saw it with the Romney campaign.
Guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for Romney.
I said what the hell is this?
I mean, you give money and they get a cut.
Look, our laws are so corrupt.
Our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt.
Its so horrible.
So horrible.
And I dont necessarily want to stop people from giving because I think thats a good thing but you have to get away from these PACs.
What you have to have is people have to know who it is.
So you have to open up the process.
Let people know.
If somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like Brad who raises hundreds of millions.
Puts a little pressure.
But the concept of the PAC is no good.
Its no good.
Its a very dangerous, terrible thing.
So we will change our laws because you really have no choice.
Its so out of control.
Its so terrible.
But the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this.
Theres so little money left over for the candidates, its one of the reasons why Im so happy Im doing my own.
We actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 PACs.
The Trump PAC, the Trump PAC, the this PAC.
First of all, Im sure that out of some of them they stole the money.
Some guy has no money.
He sets up a Trump something PAC.
Nothing to do with me.
Sets it up.
All of a sudden hes got $2 million sitting there.
Right?
People send in money.
And that guy has no money.
How much of that money do you think hes going to use to do what hes supposed to be doing?
Thats common sense.
So maybe all of it but I doubt it.
So we sent legal notices to every one that we could find.
We dont want their money.
We said "Dont do it.
We dont want it.
And we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you."
But the Super PAC concept is corrupt.
Its terrible and it should be ended.
And were going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific.
Okay?
Thank you.
...Well, look hes [referring to Cruz] from Texas.
To the best of my knowledge, theres a lot of oil in Texas.
Right?
So you know, he gets a lot of money from the oil companies and hes totally against ethanol and everything else youre talking about.
And Im not.
Im totally in favor.
And you know, its a big industry here.
Its a big industry.
You know, if that industry is upset, Iowas got problems.
I was amazed.
I was here three weeks ago with the group...They were such amazing people...And I learned so much about it.
I was in favor of it even before...
...Beyond even the fuel capacities, which we want to create as much as we can, tremendous numbers of jobs in Iowa.
And I said to myself, if Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa?
Because thats very anti-Iowa.
I dont know how he wins in Iowa.
I dont know.
No, but Im totally for it.
Okay?
Thank you.
...I was a member of the establishment six months ago.
I gave $350,000 to the RGA.
Thats the Republican Governors Association.
I gave tremendous amounts of money away.
I was like the fair haired boy.
Once I said Im running, they said "What?
Youre not supposed to run."
And then what happened  I ran against all these Senators and Governors.
And everyone said "Well, I dont know."
My wife said "If you run, youre going to win" because she understands that I like people  I love people and people love me.
And she said "You will run but you actually have to go and run.
You have to announce youre running because nobodys going to believe youre running."
And so I didnt want to announce because I didnt want to like announce and things didnt work out and Im like some of these guys where theyre zero.
Many of them zero.
And so finally I said, "Look, lets  were going to do it.
We have to do it."
Just too many things that I watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made  Bergdahl  where we get Bergdahl and they get five killers.
We get this horrible, dirty rotten spy  horrible traitor.
We get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that theyve wanted for nine years  the worst killers  and theyre all back on the battlefield.
You know, so many decisions.
The Iran deal.
The Iran deal.
How bad is that?
They self-inspect.
"Okay, good.
Were not building.
We promise were not building nuclear weapons."
"Oh, okay.
Thats okay."
And we give them $150 billion and we dont even get our prisoners back.
The whole thing is crazy.
So I saw this.
And I said to my wife, "Hey, I dont know if Ill do well or not.
Who the hell knows?"
And its a risky thing.
And Ive always heard if youre a very successful person you cant run for office, especially for president, and I see it all the time.
And the people go after me.
I dont even care at this point.
I said, "I have to do it.
Now, were going to have to do it."
And I look at it last time with Romney and I didnt do it and I probably should have because he let us down.
I mean, look, he let us down.
That was an election  we had a failed president.
Four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now.
Its true.
And Romney let us down.
That last month  it was like he wasnt even campaigning.
I said, "Why arent you on Jay Leno?
Why arent you on David Letterman?
Why arent you doing it?"
And he just didnt do it.
So he lost the election.
So I backed McCain, he lost.
I backed Romney, he lost.
This time I said Im doing it myself, okay?
Were going to win.
Were going to win.
But there is an establishment out there.
Its a real establishment.
Real people.
And theyre people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place.
And theyre people that are used to giving donations and having control.
And theyre people that, you know, look when they call me Ill treat them with respect but Im not going to be doing bad things if its bad for the country.
Im not going to let Ford build a plant in Mexico if I can keep it in Michigan.
And Im not going to let the car companies and Nabisco and all these people and all these companies  Im all for free trade.
I think its great.
Im for it.
But its got to be smart trade.
Im not going to let them move to Mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through.
How does that help us, folks?
I went to the best business school in the world.
Believe me, it doesnt help us.
Okay?
Trust me.
And were not going to make deals like that anymore.
We cant.
We owe $19 trillion.
We cant.
So the establishment is not ever probably  look, you know what?
In the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment theyll be saying "Okay, its a good thing" because theyll be beneficiaries also.
But we do have a real establishment and theyve never seen this happen before.
A writer called up and he said recently  I told this story.
I mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond.
And he said, "Mr. Trump, how does it feel?"
I said, "How does what feel?"
"How does it feel?
What youve done has never, ever been done before?"
I said, "What have I done?"
"Youve dominated the Summer of Trump."
Now they call it the Autumn of Trump.
Hopefully, theyre going to call it the Spring of Trump and I want the next Autumn of Trump.
But I said to the writer, "I dont know what youre talking about.
I havent done anything cause frankly if I dont win I consider this to be a total waste of time."
Ill be honest with you.
As much as I like being with you tonight.
Because we wont be able to do anything.
He said, "No, no.
Youve won even if you dont win.
Youve won already."
I said, "No, youre wrong.
If I dont win, I have wasted my time."
So you know, the point is that the establishment cant believe it because theyve never seen it happen before.
...I was on the cover of Time Magazine four or five weeks ago and Time Magazine was going to pick the Person of the Year.
Everybody  even my enemies  said "Trump is going to win."
I said, "I wont win."
They said, "Why?"
"I wont win.
Just like I should have gotten the Emmy for The Apprentice for the first three years.
I was nominated.
I should have."
And I said, "Ill never win."
I told everybody Ill never win because Im not Hollywood establishment.
And with Time Magazine, I said  Bill OReilly, whos a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than Trump, he should have won.
Now, Im not saying I should have  yeah, I probably should have in all fairness  but he said "Nobodys done more"  you know, taking over  what weve done has been amazing  all of us together not just me.
Its all of us.
Its all of us.
From Dallas and Mobile and Oklahoma.
All of us.
Because the spirit.
...Well, Merkel got it.
Now, Merkel, what did she do?
Shes destroyed  I mean, shes in the process of destroying Germany with the migration.
We have to help the people with the migration.
We have to create a safe zone some place in Syria.
But I dont want them coming into this country.
I dont want them because we dont know who they are.
We dont know who they are.
Them with their printing press that now do the forged passports.
Okay?
You heard about that.
So we dont know.
The bottom line on that  its such an interesting question.
Youll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly.
But the only thing I can say is this: If I win Iowa, I think its over.
I said before.
Because I think if I win Iowa, New Hampshire is amazing.
People are amazing.
You would love the people.
They would love you.
Youd love everybody.
The whole country is in love...I call it the noisy majority.
Its no longer a silent majority.
Its the noisy majority.
But if we win like I think were going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, its not going to matter.
They cant do anything.
I dont care about the establishment.
They cant do anything.
You know, the only way they can do is if Im a little bit short, if Im two votes short I have a problem because Ill have to go into that convention, Im dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and theyll make their deals and theyll have all their money guys around and theyll be in the backroom making deals.
But if I get the number of delegates, theres not a thing they can do.
And Ill end up doing fine with the establishment...


...Im such a believer in education.
You know, I had an uncle who was a professor at MIT who was a brilliant guy...In fact, I just retweeted an article about him today.
Youve got to read it.
Okay?
@RealDonaldTrump.
You have to read it.
When I see somebody like Jeb  no Ill tell you one thing I respect.
He didnt change his views.
He knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didnt change.
And I respect that to a certain extent.
But its so wrong.
Common Core is a total disaster.
We have people  bureaucrats in Washington  telling you how your child should be educated in Iowa and New Hampshire and all of the different places that we go to.
Its ridiculous.
And I go around and Ive seen the principals.
Ive seen so many students and teachers and professors and principals, and Ive seen some of the people and the love  even in Iowa at a school  Ive seen some of the love these parents give to those schools.
This is real love.
These are smart people.
And these are people that arent working for a paycheck.
These are incredible people...
Remember this: Our educational system is a mess.
We spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and were in 28th place.
And I mean like double what anybody else pays.
So I want to bring education back to the local areas.
Youre going to have parents and youre going to have unbelievably talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be well-educated because its so important.
And youre going to be very happy with it.
Okay?
Thank you.
Thank you.
...You people do it.
Were backing you 100%...We are backing you 100%.
Youre doing a phenomenal job.
There should be more people like you in this country.
You know, the whole grid is a disaster.
Right?
The whole country.
The infrastructure of our country is falling apart.
And nobody can build like me.
Its what I do.
I build.
I build.
Im building on  as you know  Pennsylvania Avenue a big tremendous hotel that I got from the government of the United States.
Can you believe it?
During the Obama administration a couple of years ago.
But we had the best plan.
The GSA is terrific.
Theyre very good.
Actually, theyre very talented people.
Were under-budget and ahead of schedule.
Thats what we do.
When you see these things where theyre building a bridge and its going to cost, you know, $1 billion and it costs $12 billion.
How about when they build a hospital and it costs $3 billion?
And I look at it  Im very good  I can look at a building and tell you how much its going to cost.
I say "$250 million."
"No, sir, $3 billion."
$3 billion?
Think somebody got rich on that one?
So were going to stop all this stuff.
Were going to make our country so strong and so wonderful.
And we all love it anyways.
We love it.
But its so sad to see whats happening.
Its so sad.
And were going to change it around.
...We have such a problem.
And the biggest problem I have, you know, it relates to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and youd see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans  they have student loans  and theyre going through nice colleges, theyre good students, they work hard, they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say, "Mr. Trump, we have no jobs.
We cant get jobs."
So theyre borrowed up to the hilt and they cant get jobs.
Were going to bring our jobs back from China.
Were going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs.
Were going to bring our jobs back from South America.
Were bringing them back from Mexico.
Were going to have jobs again.
Believe me.
Were going to be manufacturers again.
Were going to start making Apple computers in this country.
What the hell good does it do to make them in China?
I want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it.
So, were going to bring our jobs back.
Okay?
Wow!
Thank you very much.
Hello.
Id like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and California.
We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in.
Very big numbers.
Im truly honored by your support.
Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is.
Were only getting started and its going to be beautiful.
Remember that.
Tonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another.
Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history.
No matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes.
This is a great feeling.
Thats a great feeling.
This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible.
Youve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.
Were going to do it.
Were going to do it, folks.
Were going to do it.
I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down.
Too much work, too many people, blood, sweat, and tears.
Im never going to let you down.
I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and thats what it is  its a movement.
Now, recent polls have shown that Im beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that shes made and she has made tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially.
To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you.
I want to thank you very, very much.
To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support.
To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.
And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against  and hes right on that  will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible.
And thats what I do.
We are going to have fantastic trade deals.
Were going to start making money and bringing in jobs.
Now, I know some people say Im too much of a fighter.
My preference is always peace, however.
And Ive shown that.
Ive shown that for a long time.
Ive built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved  always.
My goal is always again to bring people together.
But Im forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.
Ive fought for my family.
Ive fought for my business.
Ive fought for my employees.
And now Im going to fight for you  the American people  like nobody has ever fought before.
And Im not a politician fighting.
Im me.
Youre going to see some real good things happen.
Just remember this: Im going to be your champion.
Im going to be Americas champion.
Because, you see, this election isnt about Republican or Democrat.
Its about who runs this country  the special interests or the people  and I mean the American people.
Every election year politicians promised change.
Obama promised change and it didnt work out too well.
And every year, they failed to deliver.
Why would politicians want to change a system thats totally rigged in order to keep them in power?
Thats what theyre doing, folks.
Why would politicians want to change a system thats made them and their friends very, very wealthy?
I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support  the only way you could have done it  landslides all over the country with every demographic, on track to win 37 primary/caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.
After years of disappointment, theres one thing we all have learned  we cant fix the rigged system by relying on very  and I mean this so, so strongly  on the very people who rigged it.
And they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently.
We cant solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.
Theyve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.
Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server.
Something that how shes getting away with this folks nobody understands.
Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk, and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her.
Not right.
I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and were going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.
I think youre going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.
I wonder if the press would want to attend.
Who knows?
Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into a private hedge fund.
The Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return.
Its a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.
I didnt need to do this.
Its not easy.
Believe me.
I didnt need to do it.
But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country, which has been so good to me and to my family.
Ive traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in peoples lives.
Ive visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana, and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs  they literally these jobs have virtually disappeared.
An embarrassment to our country and its horrible.
Ive embraced the victims of illegal immigration  moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldnt have been in the country.
Remember it, folks.
Remember it.
Ive visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.
Ive seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges, and Ive compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours.
Its really not to be believed.
Hard to imagine whats happened to our country.
America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder.
Were broke.
Were broke.
We owe $19 trillion.
Going quickly to $21 trillion.
Our infrastructure is a disaster.
Our schools are failing.
Crime is rising.
People are scared.
The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.
What a crowd.
What a crowd.
Thank you all very much.
We love our country.
We love our country.
But we can turn this all around.
Were going to do it by putting America first.
That commitment is the foundation for change thats been missing and its been missing for a long time.
Its important to understand what America First means.
It means on foreign policy, we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation.
It has to make us safer as a nation.
This is the opposite of Hillarys foreign policy, which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration, which is wrecking havoc all over the world and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East.
And they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks, we have made them that way.
Better hope Im president.
On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition  whats happening here is absolutely a disgrace.
No PPP [sic].
Youre right about that.
So and you mean no PP.
We are going  and remember this  we are only going to have great trade deals.
Okay?
We are only going to have that.
Were not going to approve as somebody just said the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a disaster  a disaster  for our country.
Almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular Mexico.
If its not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it.
Its got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and were suffering big league and its getting worse.
On energy policy, America First means opening up Americas great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers, including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration.
On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and businesses.
Likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.
On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of American workers.
Whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, were going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like were babies.
The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together.
Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges.
Its got to be that way.
Now, the people in charge say things cant change.
Im here today to tell you that we have to change.
We have no choice.
We have to change.
Were going to put America back to work.
Were going to make our own products.
Were going to put America back to work.
Were going to rebuild our inner cities, which are absolutely a shame and so sad, going to take care of our African-American people that have been mistreated for so long.
Were going to make you and your families safe, secure, and prosperous.
Prosperous again.
Together, we will put the American people first again.
First again.
We will make our communities wealthy.
We will make our cities safe again.
We will make our country strong again.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again!
Remember.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you very much everybody!
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you very much.
This has been a great period of time.
Its been really amazing.
Weve gotten the nomination.
Were going to have an incredible period in Cleveland.
We look forward to it.
Weve started working already on the convention.
And LeBron, good luck in the series because were going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but thats okay.
And its going to be very interesting to see what happens.
But as you know, theyre playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so I think it will be very exciting.
Itll add to the excitement in Cleveland and thats good.
Thats what we want because its going to be an exciting period of time.
We have  weve done some awfully good work.
I was just informed...that weve got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries and we still have I guess six or seven locations to go, states to go.
And in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, weve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions  by many millions more  than anybody whos ever run.
So thats a great.
You know, when you think Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far.
So thats something to me thats very exciting.
And overall, its just been a very exciting process.
I think were going to do very well.
We have no idea whats going to happen on the Democrats side but theyre certainly having difficulty.
I dont like to see people having difficulty.
But if anybody has to have it, let it be them.
And I think its going to be very interesting.
Im very proud to say that weve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, thats also a record.
So weve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters.
Our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know.
Were pretty much even and in some cases ahead of Hillary.
And I think were going to have a very, very successful number of months.
And I think it will all culminate in November and were going to make America great.
Okay?
So thats the way it is...






Im glad you asked the question because I have to tell you I have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets  almost $6 million.
And more money is going to come in I believe over the next little while too.
But Ive raised almost $6 million.
All of the money has been paid out and Im going to give it to you in just a second.
In fact, I brought a list just in case that question was asked.
But the money has been paid out.
I have been thanked by so many veterans groups throughout the United States.
One gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000.
I have been thanked by so many groups  great veterans groups.
And by the way, outside you have a few people picketing.
Theyre sent there by Hillary Clinton and theyre picketing that the money wasnt sent.
The money has all been sent.
I wanted to keep it private.
If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I dont think its anybodys business if I want to send money to the vets.
But I have to say this.
I raised close to $6 million.
Itll probably be over that amount when its all said and done.
But as of this moment, its $5.6 million.
When this started, it started with a speech in Iowa when I said lets raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million.
And it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again I think we can even do better than that.
But I will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves.
And behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves.
They are calling me.
They are furious because I sent people checks of a lot of money.
Were going to give you the names right now, which is what you want.
And instead of being like "Thank you very much, Mr. Trump" or "Trump did a good job", everyone said, "Who got it?
Who got it?
Who got it?"
And you make me look very bad.
I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.
So I will give the names because thats what you want.
Right?
Okay.
Are you ready?
I brought them here.
It takes  because you have to vet each company.
You know, much of this money was paid out fairly early.
But you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups.
You have to go through a process.
When you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that youve never heard of  charitable organizations.
You have to vet it.
You send people out.
You do a lot of work.
Now, most of the money went out quite a while ago.
Some of it went out more recently.
But all of this has gone out and Ill give you the names.
Are you ready?
Do you have your pad?
And again, I really think the press  look, the media, you know my opinion of the media.
Its very low.
I think the media is frankly made up of people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people.
But I think this is an example.
And I just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions, including myself; I gave $1 million, but I just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so thankful for what we did.
One other thing thats important to know.
Zero dollars have been taken out for administration.
You know, when you go to a lot of these different groups, in this case, zero dollars have been taken out for administration.
So a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff.
So no money  it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money.
Okay?
So you have 22 Kill and thats $200,000.
And you can call these people.
That was another thing.
A lot of the money when it was sent out, different people would call.
I could tell you, Im not going to mention anybody specifically, but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting.
Theyd call and these vet groups they dont get a lot of calls from the press.
And maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didnt know or they didnt want to talk to the press or they didnt feel comfortable.
So if they didnt say they got the money, which they all did, 100% got the money.
All certified checks.
If anyone wants to see the certified checks.
But rather than say why dont you  could I see a certified check?
They said "Well, they didnt say they got the money."
They all got the money.
But theyre not people that always talk to the press.
Many of them do talk to the press.
Many of them have  I guess you found $2 million or $2.5 million where they talked.
Well, the number is $5.6 million and its going to possibly go above that because I believe some other people are coming in.
Ready?
22Kill got $200,000.
Now, these are checks that have been delivered, that have been cashed, that are now being used to help the vets.
Achilles International  great organization  $200,000.
Much of this money was paid a long time ago.
American Hero Adventures  $100,000.
Americans for Equal Living  $100,000.
Americas Vetdogs  The Veterans K-9 Corps Inc.  $75,000.
AMVETS  $75,000.
Just so you understand.
When I didnt do the Fox debate...because I didnt think they treated me right but actually theyve been extremely fair over the last three or four months, I have to say that about Fox.
But when I didnt do that one event, the debate, I gave a speech.
I didnt have to do this with the money for the vets but I decided to because I thought it would be a good idea.
And I had some very generous people  Carl Icahn gave $500,000.
Phil Ruffin gave $1 million...Ike Perlmutter gave $1 million.
We raised a lot of money.
And I didnt have to do that.
It would have been easier just to give the speech.
And the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it, not to give money to different things because its a lot easier actually that way.
And I believe were going to have some more coming in.
Some friends of mine, some more coming in.
And that adds up to $5,600,000 total and were going to have some more coming in.
Now, every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to theyre getting a final approval from the government.
But every one of those has been passed.
This is my check for $1 million.
We have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didnt ask  I didnt ask people to be here today.
I could have asked every one of the group unlike Hillary who asks people to stand outside and say "Donald Trump didnt give the money."
Nobody gave this kind of money.
So I gave $5,600,000.
More is coming in.
Probably tops the $6 million number.
I never thought we were going to raise $1 million when we started.
And we end up doing almost $6 million.
I have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair.
A lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money.
And I just want to thank all of those people.
I wasnt too involved in picking the organizations other than to the Marine Law Enforcement.
They are fabulous people.
They honored me last year at the Waldorf Astoria.
I knew them.
I was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldnt vet them quickly.
And so I gave it to the Marine.
And if you look at number, the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation is a fabulous group and I didnt have to go through a big vetting process with them.
Because I was going to split the $1 million check up amongst...and in the end I just didnt want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups.
Because I wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart.
I didnt want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going "Where did it go?
Who did it go to?"
Then we said who it went to, then we said how much was it.
...Look, when this started...I said if we could raise $1 million that would be good.
And we ended up raising almost $6 million.
And Im going to have more coming in over a period of time.
Im totally accountable but I didnt want to have credit for it.
Actually though what I got was worse than credit because they were questioning me.
And this is money.
And by the way, most of that money went out very early just so you understand.
But a lot of these groups  getting vetted by, you know, when you pay the money out, they need government documentation.
They need a lot of different things.
Plus, we want to find out whos in the good group.
I had people  teams of people  reviewing statistics, reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money.
We have given to groups that are unbelievable groups.
And honestly, I wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters.
They are so happy.
And Im happy to do it.
I didnt want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly.
Well, generally speaking, thats 100% true.
I like scrutiny.
But you know what?
When I raise money  excuse me, excuse me, Ive watched you on television.
Youre a real beauty.
When I raise money for the veterans and its a massive amount of money  find out how much Hillary Clinton has given to the veterans  nothing.
And then I see a few guys standing out there.
They dont even know what theyre there for.
They have no idea.
Theyre there because Hillary Clintons campaign sent them.
And actually I think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with Hillary Clintons campaign, which was interesting but I wasnt surprised.
I dont want the credit for it but I shouldnt be lambasted.
And remember this: So out of the almost $6 million that was raised not one penny did I take for administration cost.
Thats unheard of.
How else am I going to raise the money?
How else am I going to raise the money?
I would have given  just so you understand.
Until I was criticized  so Im the only one in the world that could raise almost $6 million for the veterans, have uniform applause by the veterans groups, and end up being criticized by the press.
Yes, I made a speech and during the speech I said, "Lets raise a little money for the vets."
It turned out to be a lot of money, not a little money.
I thought if we could get to $1 million, it would be great, which it would have been.
Thats right.
I do raise millions.
No, I dont think so.
No, I raised almost $6 million.
Some of it didnt come through.
But more money is coming through than didnt come through.
The number probably is going to be  when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million.
I dont mind it coming from the opposition...What I do mind is when I raise all of these millions and when we started out nobody ever thought it was going to be over $5 million or close to $6 [million].
So, look, heres the story.
Heres the story.
I think and Ive been dealing with the press a long time.
I think the political press is among the most dishonest people Ive ever met, I have to tell you that.
Okay?
...But I think the political press...I think the political press  I see the stories and I see the way theyre attached.
For instance, I went down this weekend to do Rolling Thunder.
I was invited.
I didnt have anything to do with it.
We had a tremendous gathering of people  thousands  I dont know how many thousands  but many thousands of people.
And I joked "Oh, I thought we were going to go from the Jefferson Memorial to the  " I was joking.
They said "Donald Trump was disappointed".
Everybody knew I was being sarcastic and joking.
They said some of them.
Said Donald Trump was very disappointed that it didnt go from Jefferson to Lincoln.
You know, millions of people.
I was joking.
I said "Oh, Im used to watching it.
We had  " I was joking.
So they put it down as serious.
They know I was joking.
Ill give you another example.
We had a certain  same event  it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people.
I dont know  10,000, 15,000, maybe 25,000.
I dont know there was a lot of people.
Plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along.
Eugene Washington, a man I like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there.
There were many times that.
And you werent allowed to have any more people.
And all of these people were with their motorcycles in parking lots all the way.
They were waving to me as Im going.
But wait a minute.
The point is law enforcement  these people didnt allow you to have any more people.
...I had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had.
It was all cordoned off.
You werent allowed to have any more.
You werent allowed to have any more people than that.
So instead of saying Trump made a speech in front of a packed crowd, they said "Trump was disappointed" because I didnt have millions of people going from Jefferson to Washington.
I mean, give me a break.
...Honestly, its dishonest reporting.
Well, the veterans believe me.
Let me tell you, the veterans why they believe.
And I have group that I gave...[invites a veteran to speak]
...I could have asked all these groups  he just showed up.
I just saw him.
But I could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made  I didnt want to do that.
Im not looking for credit.
But what I dont want is when I raise millions of dollars have people say like this sleazy guy over here from ABC  hes a sleaze in my book.
Youre a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.
Veteran:
Thank you, Mr. Trump.
First of all for the record, Im a state representative from New Hampshire, 10 years on the veterans affairs committee, 22 years in the Marine Corps, retired First Sergeant.
What I want to clarify here first of all, I would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me hes concerned about veterans.
Thats Donald Trump.
I met him over a year ago.
Ive been involved in many fundraisers.
There are many scammers out there.
He did the right thing by vetting these groups there.
If you look at some of the groups, theyre given 20 cents, 40 cents on the dollar and theyre spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips.
He gave 100%.
The liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation.
All right?
Im a former chairman.
Ive been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans activist.
Stop using veterans as a political pawns.
Youve got a guy outside...go do a Google search on his Facebook.
Hes out there.
His pictures with Clinton.
They are using veterans as political pawns.
It must stop.
Donald Trump is doing this with a heart.
Youre all focused on the way hes raising money and youre not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday.
Youre not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists.
Look at his plans on his Trump website.
He talks about medical cards.
He talks about fixing the VA.
He talks about competition.
I think the liberal media and Ive been dealing with you a long time.
You need to get your head out of your butt.
Focus on the real issues.
Thank you.
What I did  I didnt ask Al.
Ive gotten to know Al a little bit primarily through New Hampshire where we had great victories.
But he showed up this morning because he was upset.
And many of the other groups were upset.
They received $100,000 in the mail.
They didnt even know what it was for.
It was from me.
Other groups received $200,000, $250,000.
They didnt know what it was for.
And again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying.
I have received letters  heartfelt letters.
...The bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore.
Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think Ill go over $6 million pretty easily.
Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building.
But nobody talks about that.
So we raised $5.6 million.
We have so many happy groups.
So many happy veterans.
And then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside.
Now, of course, they dont know the extent.
They probably figured based on reading the press that Trump didnt make, you know, didnt raise this kind of money.
But we raised a lot and Ill be raising more and well be sending it to other people as we get along.
Its a complicated process.
No, it doesnt...You know, the government sort of approves different groups for a lot of reasons.
So it really does  and more than anything else, its also speaking to other veterans.
We have a circle of veterans.
I dont want to send a $250,000 check to a group that doesnt do good work.
So its called vetting.
We vet the vets.
But its called vetting.
I think its bothersome because I love the vets and Ive worked hard for the vets.
And as you can see, Ive given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets.
And I think when the press portrays it differently, the press is being very dishonest.
So I dont like that.
I dont like dishonesty.
Jeff Sessions is a fantastic man.
Jeff Sessions is one of the most highly respected people in the United States Senate.
Jeff Sessions is a person that I believe that Ted Cruz has the most respect for and I think Ted thought that he would get an endorsement.
You know, Jeff Sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as hes been in the Senate.
So you know, Jeff Sessions is certainly somebody that I would consider.
Absolutely.
Hes a fantastic person.
I think it was a very tough call.
It was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla the way he held that child that almost like a mother holding a baby  looks so beautiful and calm.
And there were moments where it looked pretty dangerous.
I dont think they had a choice.
I mean, probably they didnt have a choice.
You have a child, a young child, at stake.
You know, its too bad there wasnt another way.
I thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 pound gorilla and the way he dealt with that little boy.
But it just takes one second.
Its one second  its not like it takes place over  well, hes going to do it 30 seconds from now.
It just takes one little flick of his finger.
And I will tell you they probably had no choice.
...




Im entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care.
VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country whats going on.
You look at whats happening in Phoenix and different places throughout the country where theyre catching people stealing and they dont even fire them, where people are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line.
Theyre dying while they wait on line.
And I am in favor of if they cant get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, theyre going to see a doctor and the countrys going to pay for it.
Theyre going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately.
Were losing thousands of people waiting on line.
And the Veterans Administration is run by Obama just as incompetently as hes running our country.
You look at the TSA, you look at whats going on at the airports and you look at that.
Okay?
Just take a look at that.
Thats like the Veterans Administration.
Nothing in our country works anymore.
Its a mess.
And maybe thats why Im doing so well in the polls.
No, it doesnt have to be privatization.
No, it doesnt have to be privatization.
What it has to be is when somebodys on line and they say its going to be a seven day wait, that person is going to walk over to across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of.
Were going to pay the bill.
And by the way, thats going to be a lot less expensive.
And well check it out and be careful.
But thats going to be a lot less expensive than whats going on.
These people are living in hell.
And Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Administration is working just fine.
And the head of it, [Bob] McDonald said last week that waiting in line is not bad  look at Disney World.
Okay?
These are the kind of people we have running things.
Its ridiculous.
...Thats their choice.
You have a party called the Democrats and theyre going to have to make that choice.
I think its probably going to be her because its rigged.
And I think if you people will say Im the one that came up with the term "rigged".
I used it for myself, except that I won by such big margins that the whole system is rigged on both sides.
With the Republicans its less obvious.
With Democrats with the whole super delegate thing, its ridiculous.
So I think that theyre going to have to make that determination.
If youre asking me who I prefer running against?
I think what she did was very bad and I think a lot of people have done a lot less than her and their lives have been destroyed.
The judge has been very unfair.
Has not done a good job.
Hes been a very bad judge.
Has been very unfair.
And I will win the Trump University case.
I already am as far as Im concerned.
But I will win the Trump University case.
Because I dont care...
I have a judge whos very, very unfair.
Well, youll see it in court documents.
But I have a judge whos very, very unfair.
He knows hes unfair.
And Ill win the Trump University case.
I can settle that case.
I could have settled it.
I just choose not to.
In fact, when I ran this, they said why didnt you settle up that case?
I dont want to settle the case.
Because you know what?
Because Im a man of principle.
And most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially.
It was good.
It was great.
And you know what?
When theyre on the stand and you say "How come you signed the letter saying that Trump University was so good?
How come you signed the letter?"
The woman that was the original plaintiff in the case  they went to the court and the judge allowed her to get out of the case.
The case should have been dropped.
The whole case should have been dropped.
They wanted her dismissed from the case.
You know why?
Because she was deposed, she was such a bad witness that wed win the case easily.
She signed a letter and shes on film.
Shes on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about Trump University.
So they didnt want her anymore because shes a disaster for them.
So they went to the judge and they said "Your honor, wed like to have her not be a participant, not be a plaintiff in the case."
And he said, "Oh, thats okay."
Shes the one that started the case.
Now, they dont even want her to testify.
They dont want her to testify because shes a disaster.
She has all sorts of beautiful statements about it.
And importantly, shes on tape saying how great it is.
They dont want her.
I wouldnt want her either.
Now, I could have settled that case.
I could settle that case.
I can settle that case.
I dont want to.
Ill go through the process.
Because were down the line.
Because were down the line and the fact that you cant win as independent.
For the most part, you cant even get on Texas and various other states now.
Its too late.
But Texas is out.
...Heres what happens.
What happens is you will not have  and very importantly  you will not have Supreme Court justices.
Youre going to lose.
You could have as many as four or five.
Thats over.
Now, [Bill] Kristols the one thats  but hes the last one.
Dont forget, he said "Trump will never run."
The guys not a smart person.
He said, "Donald Trump would never run."
Remember?
You remember?
I actually blame you.
Why do you put this guy on television?
I see him on the different shows.
Hes got no credibility.
Said I wont run.
If I run, I wont do well.
If I do well, this and that.
He looks like such a fool.
I saw him on one show.
Hes practically crying because he cant justify.
Now he comes out with a tweet over the weekend  over Memorial Day weekend  it sounds like hes going to put somebody up.
Even I thought it.
I thought, "Oh, theyre going to find indie."
Now he comes out with something saying he was almost  almost  kidding.
Okay?
Let me tell you, these people are losers.
Hes trying to make you  hes trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts.
If they do an indie, assuming its decent, which I dont think anybody with a reputation would do it because theyd look like fools.
But what youre going to do is you lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court, therefore you will have a group of people put on the Supreme Court where this country will never ever recover.
It will never, ever be the same.
No, I didnt say that.
I said Bill Kristol is a loser and Ill tell you why...He has called every single move.
Take a look  on me, hes going to lose this state  I won in a landslide...I didnt say everybody.
Many.
I didnt say everybody.
Wait, wait, wait.
Bill Kristol is a loser.
His magazine is failing, as you know.
Its going to be down  I dont think it even survives.
Hes getting some free publicity.
But Bill Kristol  Ive been watching this for two years.
"Trump isnt going to run."
Then I go into a race, we go into New Hampshire.
"Oh, hes not going to win New Hampshire."
I win in a landslide.
Every place I went I was not going to win.
But I win in a landslide.
Do you think maybe he doesnt like me?
Its wrong.
Its wrong.
I didnt get 30%.
My last score was 78%.
I didnt get 30%.
I dont know.
No, no, no.
Heres the way I look at it.
When I have somebody thats not on my side, when you know  by the way, Ive gotten great applause from the press in terms of as an achievement because the Republican Party is really well unified.
We have come up.
People that you would have never thought possible are now saying, "I support Trump."
So remember that.
We dont talk about that too much.
But actually last week, the big story was how fast the Republican Party is healing because it is a healing process.
It was a rough  that was a rough campaign...
I can this.
The real is how fast were getting together.
Now, if I have a Republican whos not on my side, Im not going to be  why should I be particularly nice to that person?
Im not going to go after it like I would Hillary or Crazy Bernie.
But you know what?
Why should I be nice to that person if I have a person thats not going to support me?
I have no obligation.
Politically, I may be right.
I may be wrong.
But thats who I am.
Im a very honest person...
If somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be Republican, I may choose to hit them back.
Not always.
But I may choose to hit them back.
Im not a fan of Mitt Romney.
Mitt Romney lost an election he should have won.
And if you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal about Mitt Romney, he looks like a fool.
Look, Im not a fan of Mitt Romney.
Just so you understand.
I raised a lot of money for Mitt Romney.
I made robocalls for Mitt Romney.
I made speeches for him.
He let us down.
If you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal this weekend, Mitt Romney looks like a fool.
Now, what would I say good about Mitt Romney?
She was not nice and I was fine, just a little bit of a jab.
But she wasnt nice.
And you think Im going to change?
Im not changing, including with her.
Bob Dole is a fan of mine.
Bob Dole endorsed me.
So dont tell me about Bob Dole.
Well, look, Gary Johnson, he got 1% of the vote last time.
I watched that whole situation.
It was pretty disgraceful.
I think its a total fringe deal.
I think hes a fringe candidate if you want to know the truth.
I look at him and I watch him and I watch his motions and I watch what he says.
I think that he is a fringe candidate...when you do a little research on that I think its not going to be a factor.
Okay?
No, not all of you.
Just many of you.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah, it is.
Let me tell you something.
Im a person  yeah, its going to be like this...If the press writes false stories like they did with this  half of you were amazed that I raised all of this money.
If the press writes false stories like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile.
I didnt want the credit for raising all this money for the vets.
I wasnt looking for the credit.
And by the way, more money is coming in.
I wasnt looking for the credit.
But I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didnt raise any money for them.
Not only did I raise it, much of it was given a long time ago.
And there is a vetting process and I think you understand that.
But when I raise almost $6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in.
But when I raise $5.6 million as of today, more is coming in.
And this is going to phenomenal groups.
And I have many of these people vetting the people getting the money and working hard.
And then we have to read probably libelous stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false, Im going to continue to attack the press.
Look, I find the press to be extremely dishonest.
I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest.
I will say that.
Okay, thank you all very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, thank you very much everyone.
I want to start by, as always, thanking my family.
My wife, Melania.
My kids  theyre not kids anymore but theyre kids as far as Im concerned.
Theyll always be my kids.
And I want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us.
I want to thank my entire family, including Maryanne, Elizabeth, Robert.
And its been some unbelievable day and evening and year.
I never have been through anything like this but its a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold, and were going to make America great again.
Were going to make America great again.
So important  so important that the people of Indiana have been incredible.
I started as you know not very long ago  about six weeks ago  and I was told that I had a 20 point deficit.
And I went there and I worked very hard and I campaigned and I made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people  incredible people.
You dont get better, and the crowds got bigger and bigger.
And toward the end, it was like I didnt want to leave.
I almost said, "Maybe Ill just never leave" and it resonated somehow and we have a tremendous victory tonight.
It was a tremendous victory.
And I have to thank Bobby Knight.
Boy, Bobby Knight was incredible.
He was incredible.
I always that people like that  there arent many  but its called tough, smart, and they know how to win.
And thats what our country needs.
We have to win again.
We have to know how to win.
And we havent won.
Weve been losing all the time.
We lose with our military.
We cant beat ISIS.
We lose with trade.
We lose with borders.
We lose everything.
Were not going to lose.
Were going to start winning again and were going to win big league.
Believe me.
So when I got back tonight and I started watching all of the different networks, I could immediately that we were doing very well, and it really looks like a massive victory and it looks like we win all 57 delegates.
And I must say in staying in various places in Indiana, I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads, negative one after another after another.
And I called my people and I said, "How can we win?
Its just constantly."
It was the same as in Florida.
You know, thereve been 60,000 negative ads.
I got it right from you folks, okay?
60,000.
In fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000.
Now its 60,000 negative ads  most of which are absolutely false and disgusting.
And I said how can anybody endure this?
I had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that I was watching.
And I said thats just incredible.
And the people are so smart.
They dont buy it.
They get it.
And its tremendous, tremendous amounts of money were spent  millions and millions of dollars.
And they were comparing it.
They think it was probably $8 million was spent against me and we spent $900,000.
So, I mean, to me thats the way its supposed to be.
Thats something that makes me feel really, really very good.
And now were going to Nebraska where I have  I just hear were doing really wonderfully.
I look forward to that very much.
And West Virginia.
And were going to get those miners back to work.
Ill tell you what.
Were going to get those miners back to work.
Were not going to be Hillary Clinton, and I watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again.
Let me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, theyre going to start to work again.
Believe me.
Youre going to be proud again to be miners.
So well be going there.
I must say this tremendous run that weve had started with New York when we had almost 62%.
And dont forget, thats with three people.
So 62% with two people is a massive landslide.
But 63% almost  just a little over 62%  when you have that kind of a number with three people, its actually unheard of.
And all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, its tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers.
And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people.
I think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in New York.
But we never got the credit for that.
But now we dont need the credit because were going after Hillary Clinton.
She will not be a great president.
She will not be a good president.
She will be a poor president.
She doesnt understand trade.
Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done.
Its called NAFTA.
And I was witnessed to the carnage over the last six weeks especially.
Now Ive known Syracuse and Ive known Poughkeepsie and Ive known all of the different places that I visited in New York and then Pennsylvania and then Maryland, which treated me so great the people are incredible.
And all of the different state  Connecticut.
And Ive witnessed what its done really firsthand.
And it has been indeed carnage.
And were going to change it around.
Were not going to let Carrier and all of these companies just think they can move  go to another country, make their products, sell it back to us, and we get only one thing: We get unemployment.
Not going to happen anymore, folks.
Not going to happen anymore.
Were going to bring back our jobs and were going to keep our jobs.
Were not going to let companies leave.
Now, if they want to go to a different state, good luck, compete.
But when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, thats not going to happen.
Not going to happen.
And if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences.
I have to tell you that Ive competed all my life.
Competitive person.
All my life Ive been in competitions.
Different competitions whether its sports or business or now for 10 months politics.
And I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party.
You know, we started off with that 17 number.
And just so you understand  Ted Cruz  I dont know if he likes me or if he doesnt like me.
But he is one hell of a competitor.
He is a tough, smart guy.
And he has got an amazing future.
Hes got an amazing future.
So I want to congratulate Ted.
And I know how tough it is.
Its tough.
Its tough.
Ive had some moments where its not looking so good, and its not a great feeling.
And so I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family.
And I just want to say that one tough competitor and I can say that for the others.
I mean, Chris Christie who endorsed me.
Incredible guy.
Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first.
He just called me and said, "Its a movement youve got going.
Weve got to do something because Ill tell you what, its an incredible movement."
And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me.
And I want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep Ben totally involved because were going to win.
Were going to win in November.
And were going to win big and its going to be America first.
You know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how were the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they dont respect us and they dont take care of us and they dont treat us right in many cases.
And thats not going to happen.
Now, were going to keep things going and were going to keep things going very nicely but we owe  soon  $21 trillion.
Its $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion.
And were just not in a position that were in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place.
So, were going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries.
But likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what weve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers.
So that will change.
And I will tell you, theyre going to end up liking us better than they do right.
Theyre going to respect us.
In this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China.
The relationship is fantastic.
We have great relationships with many foreign countries.
But they have to respect us and they have to understand where were coming from.
And you know, it is a two-way street.
And the two-way street means that were going down one side and theyre coming up the other.
And were going to meet and we are going to have something thats going to be really fabulous.
Now, if that cant happen.
If for some reason they want this system to continue the way its going now, which is not fair and not good, where were spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East.
And we have to build our infrastructure, our roads.
We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country.
Weve become close to a third world country.
You look at some of our airports; its third world.
And then you go to other countries and you see places like youve never seen.
So I have to say that we are going to turn it around.
Were going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before.
Its the cheapest thing we can do.
And were going to have to take out ISIS and were going to have to take them out fast.
We cant allow that cancer to continue.
We cannot allow it to continue.
And you know, one group thats been so incredible to me are the vets  the veterans.
And theyve been treated so badly.
So badly.
And were going to get that straightened out.
Now, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and its happened now with two or three.
But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, Im now leading Hillary Clinton.
A lot of good things...
And thats going to continue because theyre not going to be able to do it, folks.
Theyre not going to be able to make great trade deals.
We have such bad deals.
Theyre not going to be able to do what we do with the military.
Theyre not going to be able to do what were going to do on the border, including the wall.
Were going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics.
The Hispanics have been so incredible to me.
They want jobs.
Everybody want jobs.
The African-Americans want jobs.
You look at whats going on.
They want jobs.
And were going to bring back our jobs.
Were going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again.
And this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country.
And were going to love each other.
Were going to cherish each other.
Were going to take care of each other.
And were going to have great economic development.
And were not going to let other countries take it away from us because thats whats been happening for far too many years and were not going to do it anymore.
Were not going to do it anymore.
I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to.
Hes doing a tremendous job.
Its not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess hes down to one.
I dont know.
Is there a second?
I mean, is there a second?
I dont know.
But I have ask you folks to explain the status of that.
But hes done an amazing job and I think were going to see something really, really fantastic.
I also want to thank my staff, Paul, Cory, Pope.
I mean, these people.
What weve been doing has been incredible.
The work has been unreal.
And Jared [Kushner], married to my daughter Ivanka.
I mean, honestly, you know Jared is a very successful real estate person but I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate.
Im excited.
And hes very good at politics.
So again folks this has been an amazing evening.
I didnt expect this.
I didnt expect it.
And what Ted did is really a very brave thing to do and a great thing to do because we want to bring unity to the Republican Party.
We have to bring unity.
Its so much easier if we have it.
And many, many people are calling that you wouldnt even believe  the media, the press, they wouldnt believe.
People who have said the worst things about me  Ive never had things said about me like this.
You know, with my businesses, Ive always been very respected.
People didnt talk to me this way.
But in politics, its easy.
The worst things and theyre calling now and theyre calling us all and theyre saying, "Wed love to get on the train"  the "Trump Train" they call it  "But wed love to get on the team."
And I actually spoke to one today who was vicious.
I mean, this guy was unbelievable.
And I said, "Id love having you and I think its terrific.
But after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team?"
And he said, "Mr. Trump, dont even think about it.
Dont worry about it.
Therell be no problem."
In other words, hes a politician; theres no problem.
I would have had a hard time.
But we have a lot of people coming  lots of congressmen.
I have to thank Jeff Sessions  Sen. Jeff Sessions  one of the most respected men or people in Congress.
And so many others.
I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible.
Jerry Falwell, Jr. Liberty University, I mean he is something.
He is really a special person.
Theyve done an incredible job and everybody goes through Liberty.
We all go through Liberty and somehow he liked what I was saying and perhaps he liked the way I said it.
But hes a special guy and he really has helped.
And so many pastors and ministers.
And tonight, I see that I won with the evangelicals.
The evangelical vote was for Trump.
And theres no greater honor.
No greater honor.
Were going to work together for many, many years.
Were going to make it so good.
Were going to be saying Merry Christmas again.
Were going to be saying it...
And I won with women.
I love winning with women.
But I won with women.
I won with men.
We won with Hispanics.
We won with African-Americans.
We won with every  virtually every category.
So its just been an amazing evening.
So again, I want to congratulate Ted Cruz.
He is a tough, smart competitor.
I want to thank my wife and my family.
Its an incredible family.
I want to thank my staff  both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what were doing currently, my staff where were running for the presidency.
And remember this.
Our theme is very simple.
Its make America great.
We will make America great again.
We will start winning again.
You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
So beautiful.
She said, "Do you mind?
I wrote something  coming out, I wrote something.
Do you mind if I said it?"
I said, "Not at all.
Should I read it?"
She said, "I dont want you to read it.
I dont want you to read it."
Thank you very much.
I want to thank Melania for that.
That was very special.
You know, Wisconsins a really special place, and weve been all over today.
Speeches all over.
We had one before.
Thousands and thousands of people standing outside of an airplane hangar because the hangar was packed.
And we had another one in the morning, and its been an amazing day, and some phenomenal results.
You see whats happening with the polls.
Boom!
Like a rocket ship.
Its like a rocket.
I guess I just heard when I walked in one just came out that were 10 points up.
But dont worry about that.
Pretend you didnt hear that.
Go out and vote tomorrow.
Okay?
Go out and vote tomorrow.
You know, I always tell  I used to say this to politicians that run thatd be friends of mine, Id say, "Pretend youre a little bit behind.
Okay?
That way youd work hard.
Youd never forget."
But you know, theres somebody that was  I saw just a little while ago in the audience a very special woman, an incredible woman, and Melania just said hello and met her was so taken, and she represented you so beautifully.
And some of you know who she is.
Many of you know who she is.
But she was Miss Wisconsin.
She has one of the most incredible spirits that Ive ever seen.
Shes got her husband and her son and her son is absolutely magnificent and she loves him more than anything that you can imagine.
Ill tell you thats an amazing and just an incredible story and were going to make sure that it goes as well as it can.
She was so amazing the way she walked up here and just spoke from the heart, and we all have to speak from the heart.
And you noticed no teleprompters?
We dont have teleprompters.
We want to do it right from here and from here and from here.
But I just want to  I saw Melissa, and I said, "I have to have you up" because her storys an amazing story and its a story of courage and were going to work with her family and were going to make sure everything goes well.
Okay, thank you all very much.
So, in coming over today and in going through a few of them, I said to a few of the folks Ive got to explain whats happening because our country is being decimated by stupidity, by bad deals, by horrible trades, by TPP, which Cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy Wisconsin.
This Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster.
Cruz is pushing it hard.
Kasich, I dont think hes a player here.
I mean, the guy is one in 32.
Hes one and it was in his own state.
And if I would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in Florida, I would have won in my opinion Ohio.
Hes one and 32.
Now, in all fairness, Jeb Bush was doing a lot better than that.
Many people were doing better.
Its called you get out.
Hes taking my votes.
We have to get over 50%.
And how do you do that?
Look, at a certain point in life, what you do is you say, "Im one in 32.
In other words, Ive won one out of 32 states," and you do what Marco did, which was great, and you do what Rand Paul did, and you do what a lot of them did, and you get out.
And shes going through a very hard time.
And she has been so supportive and so like just incredible of what were all  what were trying to do.
Not me.
Im a messenger.
What were trying to do  make America great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both militarily and we dont win anymore.
We dont win anymore.
We dont win with trade.
We dont win with the military.
We pay for everybody elses military.
We dont know what were doing.
And she saw it and she was here early.
And she knows that were going to take care of our people, and its going to be America first.
Its got to be America first.
We have no choice.
We have no choice.
And shes with a friend of hers whos very well-known, Chelsea Cooley, who is a tremendous, tremendous woman and just an amazing person.
Also a great singer but I wont even mention that because Chelsea would be the last to want to have people know that.
Chelsea is such a great friend of Melissa Young and Melissa Young  I just want to bring her and Chelsea onto the stage and maybe Melissa would like to say something and Chelsea.
But this is just an unbelievable woman.
So could I ask Melissa to come up on stage please?
And by the way, if you want, you could put your name up and you say "I want to run" and you go to the convention and you run.
But it would be nice to see  because Ill tell you what, he takes my votes away much more than he does Cruz.
And I dont like it.
I dont think its right.
I dont think its appropriate.
But you know what?
If we have to live with him, we still beat him easily.
Okay, folks?
I mean, okay?
But Kasich voted for NAFTA.
NAFTA was a disaster for Wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country.
Ted Cruz wants TPP and it is going to make NAFTA look like peanuts.
What theyre doing to us with those documents, and Cruz is the one that insisted that we cant talk about money manipulation, which is devaluation of currencies in the agreement.
He wouldnt let them do it.
Hes the one that fought currency devaluation.
Thats the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business, taking our money, and taking our jobs.
And we cant let this go on any longer.
Now, theyre controlled by their PACs.
Theyre controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions.
Theyre controlled, you know, with the lobbyists in Washington.
They have signs on their forehead.
Its like stamped into their forehead  "I take care of Cruz."
Theyre specialists.
"I take care of Kasich."
"I take care of Hillary."
Oh, Hillary.
Ayeyeye.
"Take care of Hillary."
So we cant let it happen anymore.
We cant let it happen anymore.
Its time  you know Obama used to say, "Time for change"?
Ill say its time for change but real change this time not that change.
Real change.
Obama yesterday  President Obama yesterday for the first time he started having reservations about the Iran deal.
I could have told him that six months ago, nine months ago, long before it was signed.
The ink isnt even dry and now hes finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and its only going to get worse.
And by the way, Iran is getting worse.
They were supposed to come into the community.
Remember?
What a bunch of babies.
Are we babies?
Are we babies?
Hello over there.
They were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to, you know, get involved.
Now, you see they just ordered 118 Airbus jets.
Those are the big jets.
100.
They didnt order Boeing.
The reason  one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending.
So we give them $150 billion and theyre not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products.
Okay?
How crazy are we?
How much longer is it going to last?
When are we going to get smart?
When are we going to stop?
We as a country are being ripped off.
We are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world.
Okay?
Whether its militarily or trade.
We dont win anymore.
We cant win with the military.
We cant beat ISIS.
Can you imagine Gen. MacArthur or Gen. George Patton?
They say get rid of ISIS.
What do you think?
...Its so sad to see whats happening to our country and were going to turn it around and were going to change it.
And were going to make it rich again, and were going to make it strong again.
So, and so many different elements, and Ive been talking about trade.
I always talk about trade.
Because when I announced on June 16th coming down the escalator with Melania, it was like the Academy Awards.
There were so many cameras; Ive never seen anything like it.
So many cameras.
And I took a deep breadth and I said, "Lets go."
Because we have to do it.
You know, it takes guts.
Running for president, believe me, takes guts.
It takes a lot of guts.
Believe me.
And even for the politicians they run at least theyre out on the line, and then you see the dishonesty.
You see where I won Louisiana and then I find out that Im not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that I beat.
What kind of stuff is that?
And somebody said, "Well, theres a rule and another rule."
I dont care about rules, folks.
I go out and I campaign.
We win.
We win.
We get the delegates.
Right?
But in the meantime, we have millions more votes than Cruz.
Weve beaten him in most of the states.
I mean, were just winning so much.
And were winning by almost 300 delegates.
So were doing great.
And I think we close it out before the convention.
I think we actually close it out before the convention.
And thats like a prizefighter.
You know, they go into unfriendly territory, and the champ, he goes in.
And they say, "What do you think?
You may have an unfriendly decision."
He says, "No, when you knock them out, theres no unfriendly decision."
If we get the delegates, weve pulled out a knock-out.
And thats the way its going to be, and I can see that happening because more and more people are calling, they want to get on board.
Frankly, when I looked at what happened  a friend of mine, whos a great  you know, one of my great friends, he lives right down  not very far from here.
And he said, "With Wisconsin, youre going win."
I said, "Well, what do you think?
But Im not seeing polls that are great.
Im a little bit down.
Im down in some.
Im a little bit down."
He says, "No, no, youre going to win.
But you have to be there.
You have to come in and you have to talk to the people."
Like we did this afternoon at the hangar.
And he said, "Youre going to win.
I mean, youre going to win."
Hes a very smart guy, I want to tell you.
Great guy.
But he said, "Youve got to come in."
Weve been making  Ive been making speeches, three today, four yesterday, three or four the other day.
Were here constantly.
Youre going to get so sick of me.
Youre going to say, "Oh, get him the hell out of here."
No, we are making so much progress and its been so inspiring to see the people.
I mean, look at even you people.
You dont sit down.
If you want, you can.
Oh, stay up.
Stand up.
What the heck?
Hey, weve got plenty of time to sit down, right?
Weve got plenty of time.
But I do appreciate that.
Thats a sign of affection, and its a sign of respect, and I really do appreciate it.
Thats really nice.
So we have to bring our country back and so many different things.
With China, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year.
With Mexico, we will build a wall.
We will have strong borders.
Strong borders.
Believe me.
We have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year.
The walls going to cost $10 billion to build.
And people, the politicians are saying, "How can you possibly get them to pay?"
Let me tell you something, folks.
We have some good business people in this audience.
When you have a $58 billion deficit, and you have a $10 billion wall, thats real easy.
And thats on a yearly basis the $58 billion.
Its really easy.
And they dont understand it.
They said, "How are you going to get them to pay?"
I said, "Its so easy."
And you understand it.
Just rely on me.
Okay?
Rely.
So easy.
Thats so easy.
And were going to have a strong border.
You know, two days ago I was greatly honored because the Border Patrol, the folks that do a great job, and theyre told to stand back but they dont want to stand back.
They want to do their job properly.
Theyre proud people.
Theyre incredible people.
Frankly, before the wall goes up, we might not even need the wall, but were building it anyway.
Okay?
Were building it.
Believe me.
But the Border Patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago.
And I didnt ask for it.
I didnt know.
First time, first time theyve ever done it.
Right?
First time, theyve ever done it and they gave me an endorsement.
And its so important.
Now, Sheriff Joe [Arpaio] from Arizona.
You know, I won Arizona very big, and Sheriff Joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it.
Look, we have to have strong borders.
We cant let the Syrians come in that we have no idea who they are, where theyre coming from.
We dont know if theyre Syrians.
This could be the all-time great Trojan horse.
Who knows?
I have as big a heart as anybody.
We want to help them.
We want to build safe zones in Syria.
I want to get the Gulf States to pay for it.
The Gulf States have nothing but money.
We dont have money.
We will run it.
We will do a good job.
Well get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change.
We cant do it.
...I keep getting these requests.
You know, Al Green  the great Al Green wrote "The Snake".
How many people have heard "The Snake"?
How many people?
Oh, do you want to hear "The Snake"?
Do you want to hear it?
I mean, people love it and I love it because it says whats going to happen to us if were not careful.
And this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going  were going to have problems.
Were going to have huge problems.
Allowing people in from areas of the world we dont know where they come from.
We dont know where their documents are.
They say they dont have documents.
They have no papers.
No nothing.
We let them in.
How stupid can we be?
So this is called "The Snake" and I think its pretty good.
All right?
Are you ready for this?
A couple of you have heard it but some of you havent.
"On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake.
His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
Oh well, she cried, Ill take you in, and Ill take care of you.
Take me in, oh tender woman.
Take me in for heavens sake.
Take me in, oh tender woman, cried the broken snake.
She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk.
Now she hurried home from work that night.
As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake shed taken in had been revived.
Take me in, oh tender woman.
Take me in for heavens sake.
Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake.
Now she clutched him to her bosom.
Youre so beautiful, she cried.
But if I hadnt brought you in by now, heavens sake you might have died.
Now she stroke his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held him tight.
But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
Take me in, oh tender woman.
Take me in for heavens sake.
Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the very, very healthy snake.
I saved you, cried the woman, And you bit me.
Heavens why?
You know your bite is poisonous and now Im going to die.
Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in."
Right?
Thats whats happening to our country, folks.
Thats whats happening to our country and we cant let it happen.
We have to be smart.
We have to be vigilant.
We have to be strong.
And if were not, were not going to have a country.
And we need borders and were going to have borders.
And we need great trade deals and were going to make great trade deals.
And we cant let Mexico and I have great respect for Mexico and I respect their leaders but we cant let Mexico and China and any country you want to name steal our business, steal our jobs.
When you look at whats happening in Wisconsin  and you see it  the reason I beat your governor and I beat him badly was I just read off the statistics.
I just read  all I did, I stood up and I read statistics.
Youre losing jobs...Its very average.
Its very average.
Our country is less than average.
Okay?
Our country is doing so badly.
And its just one of those things and we have to smarten up and we have to get really tough.
We have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct.
We have to do whats right for our country.
When the great Ford Motor Company  great company  when they build a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico, when Nabisco moves its massive plant to Mexico from Chicago, we cant let it happen.
When Carrier Air Conditioners, as you know, they just announced theyre moving to Mexico.
Pfizer is moving to Ireland.
But let me just tell you.
So, I watched the politicians and they have no business instincts.
But more importantly, theyre taken care of.
You know, a lot of friends come up to me and they say, "Donald, let me ask you a question.
These politicians  are they really that dumb?"
I said, "No, theyre not actually that dumb.
Some are.
But theyre not actually that dumb.
Theyre all taken care of by the special interests.
And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington."
Hey, who is better than me?
I mean, take a look at me.
I was before June 16th, I was a part of the establishment and they will do not whats right for you but they will do whats right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the United States continues to get ripped off, ripped off, ripped off.
And a lot of times, Ill say, "How can a deal be so stupidly made?
These people are so stupid."
Theyre not stupid.
Theyre doing it for themselves.
Theyre doing it because they want campaign contributions.
Theyre doing it because they want money put in their PACs.
They are totally controlled by the money.
Believe me.
They are totally controlled by the money, and thats not good for our country.
Okay?
Thats not good because terrible things are happening and were getting weaker and weaker.
Hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs are being taken out.
You look at the jobs we have.
Even in Wisconsin, I mean, you see the jobs, the manufacturing, its all so down and so gloomy and throughout the United States.
And its a disaster whats going on in our country.
Were not going to have jobs left.
And they do it with manipulation of currency.
And they do it with guile.
They do it with so many different elements that our people dont even know whats happening.
Our politicians in most cases dont even know whats happening.
And when they do know whats happening and they let it happen, its even worse.
So Im not taking money from anybody.
Im self-funding my campaign.
And were going to get it.
Were going to get it.
Now, I look at this U.S. manufacturing  I mean, just look at this.
Look at these charts.
I mean, you can see them...This is where were going.
You know thats not good.
Right?
This is where were going.
There was one that I just saw.
Just got this.
Its like incredible.
Look at this.
This is U.S. manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year 2000.
Look at that chart.
Another couple of years, there wont be any jobs.
And the jobs we have now are bad jobs.
These are bad jobs.
These arent good jobs.
And everybody admits that.
Even the other side says, "We agree.
Theyre bad jobs."
And the number that they talk about when they say 5% unemployment  its a fictitious number.
When you stop looking for a job, youre considered statistically employed.
It was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good, to make them look really good like the economy.
The economy is not good.
The economy is bad.
Were sitting on a bubble.
The banks have money.
They give it to you for nothing if youre rich.
If youre not rich, thats when you need the money, they dont loan it to you.
So the people cant do jobs.
Probably here you have some great companies, some really good smaller companies, you cant get the banks to give you money.
The banks are controlled by the regulators.
They system that this country is run under is out of control.
And were going to change it.
Were going to bring back the jobs.
Were going to bring back our companies.
And you know Ive had such a response.
And the reason Ive had response is because of that and then I look at the ads today.
Im in hotel and I look at the ads and Cruz makes up these ads.
"Were going to bring back jobs"  hes using my same language.
Heres the problem.
They dont know where to begin.
They dont know where to begin.
And if they did, Lyin Ted, lyin, he comes up.
Did you ever see a guy like this?
Just look what he did with Ben Carson.
Ben Carson, who endorsed me by the way, is a great guy, and Lyin Ted, remember in Iowa, he said "Ben has left the race.
Hes left the race."
This was on election day.
Its not like two days before or the day after.
"During the election, he left the race."
Okay?
And people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for Ben but for Ted Cruz.
Its pure deception.
Its lying.
And then there were many other things.
And actually during one of the debates, Marco Rubio looked over and he said, "Youre a liar."
And I said, "You know, I never heard a politician call another politician liar so we can do it."
So we now call him Lyin Ted  Lyin.
Its crazy.
Its crazy.
I mean, what he does and what he says is just terrible.
And you know, Ive met a lot tougher people but Ive never met any human that lied as much as him.
And he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support I have?
I have Jerry Falwell Jr. from Liberty University.
I have all of these people.
I have such incredible support.
And the evangelicals  he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they dont like liars and they see he lies so much.
Do you ever see him  he walks up and he walks in with the Bible, held high.
Right?
Held high and then he starts to lie.
Boy, he is bad.
So anyways, I dont think that youre going to fall for that.
I really dont think that anybody is going to fall  he doesnt talk.
He debates...I said, "Ted, take it easy.
Just talk.
Talk.
Talk."
But were doing really well.
The whole thing is just working out.
And I loved being here.
You know, Ive been here for a long time.
Ive been here for a long time.
Im going here  were going to stay tomorrow.
Were going to have some, I think Im doing Fox and Friends tomorrow morning.
Im doing some shows tomorrow.
Were going to do some shows and were going to be around and were going to make sure  we want to bring this home.
If we can  you know, we have a movement going on, folks.
And its a movement of intelligence, actually.
Its a movement of common sense.
Thats all it is.
Were not going to let Carrier make air conditioners, fire all of its people, move to Mexico, make the air conditioners then come in and take the money out of the country.
Its not going to happen anymore.
And Im a free trader.
And they say, "Hes not a  " Remember Jeb Bush?
"He is not a conservative."
I said, "What?"
I am a conservative.
But you know what?
I believe in free trade.
But when you have free trade, you need smart people running your side of the free trade.
If you dont have smart people or if you have people like Ted Cruz that are totally controlled by the people that give him the money and theyre controlled by the establishment.
I mean, look at the establishment.
This guy in his whole life didnt know what the word establishment meant.
Now you have all these people going because they said, "Oh man, Trump is terrible.
He doesnt want any of our money."
I had one friend that came into my office  I dont think Ive ever said this before.
He came into my office.
He wanted to give me millions of dollars.
I said, "I cant take your money.
I dont want your money.
Im self-funding."
He said, "No, no, no, youve got to be kidding."
He didnt even know.
He thought I was kidding.
He wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me.
I said no, no, I dont want.
Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didnt want his money and hes leaving.
And I said, "By the way, what are you going to do now?"
He said, "Im going to give it to another candidate."
And I said, "Why?"
Theyre gamblers.
They have to do it.
Its like almost a disease.
They have to do it.
Its the craziest thing.
He loves me.
He wants to give give me probably close to $10 million.
Right?
I would have had the greatest Super PAC in the history if I would have taken all the money.
And my whole life, you know, Ive said this before, my whole life as a business person is this.
Right?
Its okay.
Nothing wrong with it.
I take.
I keep taking.
I take and take.
But now Im going to take for the United States.
Were going to take.
Were not going to be the stupid people anymore.
Were not going to be the stupid people anymore.
We cant be.
We cant be.
And with NATO when they dont pay, you know, I said  I was asked a question by Wolf Blitzer, a very fair question about NATO.
Now, you know, Ive been a businessman.
World class.
I filed my business papers.
They were phenomenal.
Everybody says great, great, great.
I built a great company.
Very little debt.
Tremendous cash flow.
Some of the greatest assets in the world.
And I tell you that only for one reason  thats the thinking we need in Washington.
We need some of that thinking.
And Wolf Blitzer asked me a question on television.
He said, "Let me just ask you about NATO."
Now, I havent been asked about NATO a lot but I understand NATO and I understand common sense, and Im like a smart person like many of the people in this room.
Hopefully all of the people in this room.
But he asked me about NATO.
I said, "Its obsolete."
This was my first thing.
And you know what?
Im the first one.
Guys that study NATO and good people but they study NATO and they say, "I dont believe it.
What he just said, I never thought of it."
They study it because theyre so into it that they dont realize because it was really put there.
You had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different but Russia is powerful so we could sort of say thats a balance.
So well leave it.
But it doesnt really cover terrorism like its supposed to.
Doesnt have the right countries.
I mean, many of the countries and there arent  that you associate with terrorism.
And so I said number one, its obsolete.
I said number two, to the best of my knowledge, the United States pay far too much proportionately and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people?
And the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes  headlines the next day  "Trump doesnt want NATO, wants to disband NATO".
And thats not what I said.
I said, youve got to pay your bills.
And you know what?
If you cant pay your bills, honestly, there should be  theyve got to go because we cant do it.
You know, this isnt 68 years ago.
This isnt when it was originally formed like many, many years ago, many decades ago, and you have to re-do things.
But it is interesting.
Some of the smartest people have said "What Trump said is genius.
Its obsolete.
And you know what?
Its true."
Theres a lot of people, a lot of countries being given a free ride.
We cant have the free rides any more, folks.
...Thank you.
Well, we need somebody with that...And its America first, folks.
Its America first.
So then, as you know, North Korea is a big problem.
North Korea is a problem.
A problem that could be solved easily by China but they dont want to solve it because they want to tweak us.
Theyre building in the South China Seas a massive military fort.
You know whats going on.
They shouldnt be doing that.
And theyre taking our money and, you know, you talk about the imbalance of trade, you talk about the kind of money.
How about this?
We owe China $1.7 trillion.
Now, they take our money.
They take our jobs...Im not angry at China.
Im angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen.
Im not angry with China.
If you can get away with it, you do it.
But they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our money.
They take everything.
We owe them $1.7 trillion.
Thats sort of like a magic act.
Doesnt it?
Amazing.
Japan, they send cars by the millions.
They come off those boats.
Los Angeles  I was there at the docks.
I looked at the biggest boats youve ever seen.
Biggest, greatest ships youve ever seen.
The cars are pouring off the ships.
We owe them $1.5 trillion.
Its like, well, how does this all happen?
Okay?
How does it happen?
Heres the story, folks.
Were going to change our thinking.
Were going to be the smart people again.
Were going to be so smart.
Were going to be so sharp.
So a lot of people dont know we protect Japan.
Do you know that?
Does anybody know?
You might know...We protect Japan.
We protect Germany.
We protect South Korea.
When you want a television set, who do you get it from?
South Korea.
Samsung.
LG.
You get it from South Korea.
So we protect all and big ships they make.
These are monster, monster economies.
We protect them.
They dont pay what they should be paying for not having to have this massive military apparatus that we supply.
And you know what?
We get that because we have people that dont know what theyre doing in Washington for many years.
I mean, Im not even blaming it  Obamas the worst.
Hes the worst.
The worst.
I mean, when he just realizes, I mean he just realized that the Iran deal is a bad deal.
It just took him  realize  I said, "Oh, why didnt you listen to me two years ago?"
Just two years ago if he would have listened  can you imagine?
Did you ever see a deal take so long?
By the way, usually when a deal takes that long, its bad automatically.
I can usually tell you that.
But anyway, so we protect Japan.
So it comes out...I said, look, I would have to tell Japan and Im talking about other nations also because I have great friends from Japan, I have great friends from South Korea.
We have to go see them, go to talk to, have a meeting with them, "We love protecting you."
We dont want them to arm necessarily.
But you know, at some point, how long are we going to do this?
So we have to see them and we have to say, "Youve got to help us out."
You know, we have this massive, massive amount of money that we have to get rid of because were sitting on one of the worst bubbles youll ever see.
Okay?
Believe me.
Weve got to straighten it out.
Weve got to straighten out our trade deals.
Weve got to straighten out our military deals.
Were taking care of all these countries.
So we go to Japan.
And heres what the...I was telling the people and they said "Wow, that sounds good."
Weve got to take  youve got to take care of us.
Now, theyll probably say initially "No".
And then we leave and then theyre going to say, "Yes."
But if they dont say yes, you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk.
You have to be...
The problem with the Iran deal was that Secretary Kerry was like an amateur.
Call him amateur night.
He refused to walk.
They were laughing at him in the streets of Iran.
They were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made.
They were saying "This deal is unbelievable."
They were laughing at the Secretary of State of this country.
They were laughing at the United States saying that this deal is great.
And they were dancing.
Remember?
Burning the flag dancing?
When they start dancing about a deal that Im making, when they start burning the American flag, Im out of there.
Bye bye.
Good luck.
And he just kept going back.
And I kept waiting.
I wanted to call him.
I wanted to call him.
I wanted to say, "Walk."
Because every single thing  hed say, "We would like to get this."
"No!"
"Oh, okay.
Youve got it.
We would like to get that."
"No!"
You know, the Persians are great negotiators.
Its an unbelievable deal.
But just yesterday, Obama just yesterday he brought it up that hes very unhappy.
I mean, think of it.
Think of it.
$150 billion.
Its the worst deal.
We didnt get our prisoners back.
We should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating.
Increase the sanctions.
Dont sit at the table.
Say "You give our prisoners back or were not starting."
You leave.
Theyll say "No".
You leave.
And what happens?
You double up the sanctions.
Within 24 hours, they call you and they say, "Youve got your prisoners."
That could have been years ago.
Right?
So we have people that dont know what theyre doing.
Heres the story.
You need Trump.
You do.
You need Trump.
You bet...You do.
I mean, youve got to have Trump.
I mean, its sort of interesting because I see when I turn on the television, I see these ads about myself by crooked people.
I see these ads and theyre mostly wrong.
A little bit sometimes are right but theyre all negative.
You know.
And Im looking, Im watching this on television  ad after ad.
In Florida, they spent $38 million on negative ads and I won it in a landslide...Does anybody read?
Does anybody watch television?
You know, its not much for the advertising community when you think they spent $38 million  a record number in Florida.
They spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide  listen to this one  55,000 negative ads on me.
Most of them was made up.
Ill give you one good example.
We have the Club for Growth, which is forget them.
These are among the dumbest people that youll ever meet.
They come to my office.
They want me to give them $1 million.
A friend asked me, "Please see them."
I said, "Who are they?"
"Theyre Club for Growth."
Whatever that means.
So they come to my office.
They asked me for $1 million.
I say, "No, thank you."
And thats it.
Then they write me a letter, which I posted, asking me for $1 million.
I said very nicely  Im not a bad person  I said nicely "No, thank you."
I mean, you can be rich but you dont have to be stupid.
Okay?
Why am I going to give them $1 million?
So, what happens is all of a sudden I see their name all over the place  "Club for Growth" and they talk about, you know, different things  ridiculous things.
I mean, theyre the worst ads.
And by the way, once was a fraudulent ad because they said, "If Cruz and Kasich got together and you added the delegates"  and they showed the delegates.
Right?
And you add them up  and Im over here with a lot.
And they said  and they add them up and they show a graph that goes much higher than mine and its much lower than mine.
Theyre a fraud.
And what we did is we told them to stop that ad and that was a week ago.
And we tweeted about it.
And everybodys talking about it.
And I see it last night again.
Theyre crooked.
So heres what they do.
Its like a form of extortion, I guess.
Right?
When you think of it.
They come to your office.
They ask for $1 million.
You dont give them $1 million.
They go out.
They do negative ads.
These are the people  you know, if these people about Trump  they call it like "No Trump".
What do they call that thing?
They call it "Never Trump".
Oh, you need Trump so badly though.
I was saying if they would work, if they would have worked so hard, so diligently against President Barack Hussein Obama, they would have beaten him.
They would have had great budgets.
They would have had everything they wanted.
But with him...I always say, "Obama is the worst negotiator Ive ever seen."
You look at the  no, except with the Republicans.
He gets everything he wants.
I mean, you look at the omnibus budget from three months he got everything he wanted  fund Obamacare, bring people into the country that shouldnt be here.
He got everything he wanted.
So he is the worst negotiator worldwide.
We have Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl.
Right?
We get Bergdahl, a traitor.
No, no, think of it.
This is a negotiation.
We get Bergdahl.
And they get  what do they get?
Five of their most coveted killers that have been in jail for eight years in Gitmo, which were not closing down by the way.
Okay?
Were going to run it.
So we get Bergdahl, a traitor, who five or six  probably six  people were killed going out to try and get him back.
He left.
Hes a traitor.
So we get Bergdahl, and thats what we get.
And they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight, including us.
Okay?
Weve got to stop it.
Weve got to stop it.
So with Japan, I said they got to  maybe weve got to walk.
And the next day the headlines  "Trump doesnt want to defend Japan", "Trump wants Japan to get their nukes".
Okay, heres the story, folks.
You have Japan.
Japan is very concerned with North Korea.
You know, number one, I like the way it is now but I want them to pay a lot more money.
They probably will.
But if they dont, its not so bad if they are at heads.
Maybe were not supposed to get into that fight.
Thats a bad fight.
Maybe were not supposed to.
Okay?
Okay?
Same thing with South Korea.
I mean, every time he raises his head and he starts talking, every single time he raises his head, our ships start floating over, our planes start going over.
We do all sorts of exercise.
What are we get out of this?
We have 28,000 soldiers on the line.
So, we have to be taken care of.
Now, Im talking as a person financially.
Okay?
Im also talking militarily.
But Im talking financially.
We dont have a country that can do this anymore.
Saudi Arabia, until the oil went down and now theyre still making a fortune.
But Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day.
We protect Saudi Arabia.
If we werent there, Saudi Arabia wouldnt be there.
If Saudi Arabia didnt have us for years protecting them, they would have been gone a long time ago as Saudi Arabia.
Somebody else would have it, probably maybe Iraq because he would have come back.
And by the way, speaking of that, you know, I was against going into Iraq.
Everyone says, "Oh, Trump is going to be very tough."
I was against going into Iraq from the very beginning, from the very beginning.
And Im going to build our military bigger, stronger than ever before.
But you know what?
Hopefully, we never have to use it.
Nobodys going to tell us what to do though.
We have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted.
But if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years, many years, we would be much stronger in a sense.
Wed be much stronger because the Middle East is a disaster.
You see the great migration.
Its a catastrophe.
You see whats going on in Germany.
Its a total mess.
What she has done.
Can you imagine?
She was Person of the Year.
I was supposed to be Person of the Year on Time Magazine.
She beat me out and she destroyed Germany.
Can you believe this?
Thats not good.
I wonder if Time Magazine had that one to do over again what theyd say.
I think well be in much better shape.
Well, theyve treated me nice.
Ive been on the cover a lot.
And the reason were on the cover a lot is because we have a movement the likes of which people have never seen.
So heres the story.
Heres the story.
You know, one of the great writers called me up and he said, "What youve done is incredible."
I said, "No, no, I have to win."
He said, "No, no, it makes no difference.
If you win, if you lose, it doesnt matter.
What youve done is down in the history books.
You will be cover for all time.
Its incredible."
I said, "No, sir.
No, sir.
I have to win.
Because if I dont win, to me, I will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time."
So heres the story.
Heres the story.
Were going to take care of our Second Amendment.
Its being chipped and chipped.
Were going to get rid of Common Core.
Were going to bring education back locally.
Were going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total catastrophe.
Youre going to have great health insurance.
Were going to save your Social Security.
Were going to save your Medicare.
We are going to save it because we are going to make our country rich again.
Were going to bring back our jobs.
Were not going to let our jobs go.
And were going to be able to afford  youve been paying in it a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell.
Its not going to happen.
Okay?
Remember that.
Its not going to happen.
Were going to start winning again, folks.
We dont win anymore.
We dont win anymore.
We dont win with our military.
We cant beat ISIS.
Were going to win.
Were going to knock the hell out of ISIS.
We dont win with our vets.
Our vets are being treated worse than illegal immigrants.
Our vets are being treated so unfairly.
Theyre our great people.
And other people  you know, vets have endorsed me virtually unanimously and a lot of the vets will come up to me and say, "You know, Mr. Trump, we follow closely whats going on.
Youre the only person that ever mentions the vets."
Right?
And Hillary Clinton recently said about the vets that theyre being taken care of just fine.
Theyre not being take care of fine.
Theyre not being taken care of.
She said theyre being taken care of just fine.
I know the vets.
Nobodys spent more time with the vets that are running.
And were going to take care of our vets.
Okay?
We are going to tear up and make great and very lucrative and everybody is going to be happy, including the other side, trade deals.
I have the greatest people in the world for dealing.
We use political hacks that dont know what theyre doing.
Theyre dealing against the smartest people in China, the smartest people in Japan, the smartest people from all over the world, and our negotiators are political hacks and were not using them anymore.
Were using the greatest business people in the world and we have them in this country and theyre endorsing me, and I know the best ones from the not so great ones.
And were going to have great, great trade deals.
Were going to have a strong border.
Were going to have a real border.
Were going to have a wall.
Mexico is paying for it.
Were going to have a wall.
And were going to stop bad, bad things from happening in this country.
Because if you look at whats going on and you look at the tremendous crime and you look at the drugs that are pouring across the border, its  the drugs are pouring like water.
Theyre pouring across.
You know when I won  New Hampshire is a special place to me because they were the first victory I had.
And I won New Hampshire, and I wasnt expected to win it; Jeb was expected to win it.
And I won it in landslide.
And Id go around and Id see the people of New Hampshire, and they tell me, "Mr. Trump, our biggest problem is heroin."
I said, "Heroin?"
It doesnt make sense.
You know, you look at the beautiful trees or the woods or the roadways and the lakes.
I said, "Heroin?"
It just doesnt work.
Its incongruous.
Right?
It doesnt work.
But it was heroin.
And I said, "If I get in, were going to stop that problem."
Then I said, "Where does it come from?"
They said, "It comes from the southern border.
They come right in."
Now, New Hampshire rated it their number one problem.
They have a tremendous problem.
But many other communities, including you, but many other communities have this problem.
Were going to stop it cold, folks.
Were going to stop it cold.
And the bottom line is this.
Look, we have a big, big day.
And youre going to look back on this evening and youre going to say that was one of the great evenings of your life because we love the country.
We love the country.
...I love you too.
Thank you.
Really do.
I love the people.
I love the people.
You know, they say Donald Trump  my base is so strong.
They say, "Donald Trump can do almost anything."
In fact, one person today said "Anything".
And they interviewed a woman, I saw her last night on television sitting in a hotel room, which was not the most beautiful room Ive ever been.
It was very clean, and I only want clean.
I dont care about the room.
I want clean.
But they were sitting there and they said to a woman  a wonderful woman, probably 55 years old, and her friends were there.
And they said, "What would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than Donald Trump?"
She said, "Dont play that game.
Theres nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him."
And I wanted to go up and I wanted to hug that television set.
I wanted to  I wish I could find out who she is.
But we have so many people like that.
Were all like that.
I mean, a big chunk of the country is like that because were tired of stupidity.
Were tired of seeing whats happening to our great country.
So, heres the deal.
Youre going to go home and youre going to remember this.
But much more importantly, tomorrow, you get everybody you can and I promise you.
Youre going to be so proud of your country.
Youre going to go out and vote.
Youre going to be so proud of your president.
But forget that.
Youre going to be so proud of this country again.
And youre going to remember the evening because were going to start winning again.
Were going to win on trade.
Were going to win with our military.
Were going to knock out the ISIS.
Were going to win.
We are going to win with the military.
Were going to knock out ISIS.
Were going to knock them out.
Were going to win for our vets because our vets have been treated too badly.
Its not going to happen anymore.
Were going to win at the border.
Were going to win with education.
Were going to win with our Second Amendment.
So many people talk to me about the Second Amendment.
Were going to win at every single element of what were doing.
And every single thing were going to win, win, win.
And youre going to say, "That was the single greatest vote that I have ever cast", and youre going to look back and youre going to be proud of yourselves and youre going to be proud of your country again.
So thank you very much everybody.
This is a great, great honor.
Thank you!
Get out and vote!
I love you all!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Thank you!
Thank you.
I feel so badly.
Outside we have 5,000 people and they cant get in.
I feel badly.
I want to apologize.
We have speakers outside.
But I want to apologize.
Who would have thought we have over 5,000 people cannot get in.
...Its an honor to be here.
Its an honor to be with you.
And very important.
You know, were doing really well and millions of votes ahead of Cruz.
Millions.
You know, I get a kick.
I call him Lyin Ted.
Lyin Ted Cruz.
He stands up  and I win as you know, youve seen it.
I have been winning all of the evangelical vote.
But he stands up Bible high, puts it down and then he lies.
You know, its amazing to watch it.
But he said, "Yeah, Im the only one who can beat Donald Trump.
Ive done it time after time."
And I said, "Wait a minute.
Ive won like most of the states."
I think he had like 5 or 6 and I had 20 or 22.
Right?
And I said I cant believe it.
And I have millions of votes more.
He says, "Im the only one that can out-vote him."
And Im saying but I have like millions of votes more.
Ill tell you something so important.
There is something happening.
Its like a movement.
Its incredible.
Its a movement.
And were part of the movement.
Not me.
Im a messenger to be honest.
Im a messenger.
And this is something thats so special and so amazing and its on the cover of time magazine.
Its on the cover of every newspaper.
Its something that has maybe never happened and theyre saying its phenomenon.
Sometimes they say Im a phenomenon.
Im not.
The message is what we want.
We want jobs.
We want trade deals that are smart deals not stupid deals.
And you know, Wisconsin.
I wrote down some notes...and its like devastating.
So [Scott] Walker came out today.
I wrote down notes about Wisconsin.
Look, he certainly cant endorse me after what I did to him in the race.
Right?
But look at this.
By the summer of 2015, Wisconsin was facing a $2.2 billion two-year budget deficit.
Thats terrible.
By the way, these are out of books.
Like this isnt Trump.
This is out of books.
Total state debt is $45 billion.
Now, maybe somebody is going to tell me thats wrong but again these are  $45 billion.
Very high.
One of the higher ones.
20,000 fewer people in the labor force in Wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by 100,000.
So your population is higher.
Now, I wouldnt have done this but he endorsed Cruz.
What am I going to do?
Am I going to say hes doing a great job?
Hes not doing a great job.
You know, he comes in with his big motorcycle jacket and big Harley.
I love Harleys.
Right?
But the motorcycle guys like Trump.
They really like Trump.
And he doesnt look like a motorcycle guy to me.
Im sorry.
Im sorry.
Unemployment rate  well, they say  that cant be possible.
Unemployment  they have down 20%.
That cant be possible.
What?
Is it 20%?
Effective or regular?
Effective unemployment rate 20%.
Hey, this is out of the big book.
800,000 food stamp recipients.
Middle class hit very, very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs.
These are the stats.
Right?
You know about this, right?
It goes on and on.
Wisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to Mexico since NAFTA.
Now, just so you understand, Kasich is running also.
We forget about him.
He voted for NAFTA.
Both of them want TPP.
TPP  Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Both of them want Trans-Pacific.
That will make NAFTA look like a baby, and Wisconsin will be hit so hard.
...
...But the motorcycle guys love Trump.
I love the disabled veterans and the veterans.
Were going to take care of our veterans.
You know that, right?
Were going to take care of our veterans.
What is it about Trump that they like?
Im serious.
We went to Hilton Head.
We went to different places, and there were hundreds, hundreds of bikers out there.
Beautiful bikes.
Lots of Harleys, right?
Lots of Harleys.
Made in America.
But beautiful, beautiful bikes...
I dont know what it is but they like me.
I feel good with them.
I feel safe.
I got out took a picture.
Secret Service went crazy.
I said, "These are great people.
Dont worry about it."
But listen, I appreciate it, fellas, I appreciate it.
...Were going to keep you free.
Im going to keep you free.
Because were getting rid of ISIS.
Were going to have good borders.
Were going to have borders again.
Were going to have borders again.
So here we have something thats pretty interesting  I love you too.
You lost 70,000 jobs to China.
70,000 jobs.
100,000 illegal immigrants living in Wisconsin.
Taxpayers are paying tens of millions of dollars.
Look, I dont know.
I dont know.
So what happened with Walker and I just will finish off with this  hes a nice man.
He came up to my office like about a year ago before I did  you know, Ive been a politician for about eight months, right?
I never thought Id be a politician.
The last thing on my mind I want to be was a politician.
But I built a great company.
I filed papers.
The company is incredible.
Very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the great assets in the world.
And I say that not in a bragging way.
I say that because thats the kind of thinking we need, folks.
We cant have China ripping us off and Mexico and Japan and Vietnam.
We cant have it.
We cant have it.
And they are ripping us like theyve never ripped anybody before.
Weve rebuilt China.
I mean, were rebuilding Mexico.
You look the other day you saw Carrier moving down.
Carrier Air Conditioning.
I buy those air conditioners  a lot of them.
Im not buying any more of them.
But Carrier Air Conditioning moving to Mexico.
Ford moving to Mexico.
Nabsico  home of the formerly wonderful Oreo which we dont eat anymore.
Right?
We dont eat it.
We dont eat it.
Number one, its a good  its called an enforced diet.
But you know what?
Look, were losing our jobs.
Look at your jobs.
When I see that statistic, I mean youre losing your jobs.
When I went after your governor when he decided to run and I said, "You know, Im going to be nice to him.
Hes a nice guy."
The guy came up to my office.
He handed me a plaque because I supported him.
What do I know?
I supported him.
I gave $50,000 or $100,000.
Thats a lot of money for a guy youve never met before.
Right?
Thats pretty good.
But I like the fact that he was fighting, fighting, he was always fighting.
You know, to a certain extent, Id rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess.
But he was fighting and I gave him a lot of money and he came up, you know, a year ago or so and he gave me a plaque.
Beautiful picture of something.
I havent  I never really got to read it to be honest.
And I put it aside.
That was it...
Because if we win Wisconsin, its going to be like over, pretty much over.
Because were going to do great.
...Emerson poll came out.
I think I have 67%, 68% in New York compared to like 10% or whatever, and you have Cruz talk about New York values, New Yorkers are no good.
I watched New Yorkers rebuild the World Trade Center.
I watched New Yorkers dying.
Believe me, New Yorkers are good.
New Yorkers are very good.
But Cruz said theyre no good.
So anyways, so I think were going to do great in New York.
Were going to do great in New Jersey.
Chris Christie endorsed me.
Well do great in New Jersey.
Good guy.
Ben Carson endorsed me.
Sarah Palin endorsed me.
Sheriff Joe from Arizona.
We love Sheriff Joe.
And you know, with the evangelicals, Ive had so many ministers.
Ive had so many pastors endorse me.
And Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed me.
It was incredible and weve done so well with the evangelicals.
I mean, Christians, evangelicals, weve done so well.
In fact, in South Carolina, when we went to South Carolina, that was going to be Cruzs territory.
He was going take it, except we won it in a landslide.
You know that.
You saw it.
He was there.
This guy follows me around, Ill tell you.
But you were there.
Remember, he was going to win that in a landslide.
And then I started speaking.
I started talking to people, and I started saying the good and the bad and the ugly.
And we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals.
Ive won just about I think almost every place Ive won with evangelicals.
And its been an amazing time.
So now Im here to talk to the people of Wisconsin.
I have friends in Wisconsin.
Ive been here before.
Its an incredible place but its a place that has problems.
But you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesnt have a problem.
I remember when he was on the campaign trail, I was so nice to him.
I said, "How can I hit him?
Im not going to hit him.
Im not going to hit him."
And I was so nice.
I hit Jeb instead, right?
Right?
And I hit Rand, Rand, old Rand.
And I hit a lot of people and they all went down.
Wouldnt it be nice to have a president that could just with his mouth make things happen that are positive?
You know.
But its not with the mouth.
Its really with the mouth, the heart, and the brain.
Remember the brain.
I have a lot of friends.
Theyre good with the mouth but theyre not good with the brain.
It all doesnt work.
Okay?
You know, we had an interesting thing today.
A poll came out  a nationwide poll.
A great poll.
It was Trump 48%.
It was an NBC poll.
Trump 48%.
Cruz was second in the 20s, mid-20s something.
And Kasich was way down.
So what happened is they showed the poll.
It was an NBC poll.
They call it an NBC monkey poll.
And it was on the Today Show, and it was on Morning Joe.
Morning Joe held it up and he said, "Wow, those are great numbers."
48% is pretty good.
You have three people.
You know.
I dont get enough credit for that.
Ive been at 42%, 44%, 45%, and Ive had like seven people.
How do you get 45% when you have seven people?
Nobody says that.
They say, "He hasnt cracked 50%."
How do you crack 50% when you have all these people running?
So Im at 48%.
Poll was good  way, way ahead of anybody else nationwide.
And they showed Hillary Clinton  hers is very close.
Shes got a little problem.
Could happen.
Got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with Bernie to be honest with you.
She should have.
Her bigger problem should be with emails.
Well find out how honest our country is, right?
But shes got a sort of close race.
And they put her poll up and it was put up there.
You know, big letters.
And then they said, "And Donald Trump is winning."
That was it.
They didnt put numbers up.
They didnt say Im doing great.
In fact, they said, "Donald Trump is winning," and they put some  a little slightly negative statistic in  it was like wait a minute.
They put her numbers up and they didnt put my numbers up.
Folks, its so unfair.
The press is so dishonest.
Its unbelievable.
That was Chuck Todd.
That was Chuck Todd this morning on the Today Show.
They put Hillarys numbers.
And Im winning by a lot and they said, "Donald Trump is winning.
You know, lets go to a new subject, okay?"
Now, I guarantee you one thing.
If I was losing or doing poorly, itll still be up.
Itll be up all morning because they dont like whats happening.
Im self-funding my campaign.
Im putting up my own money.
They dont like it.
Ted Cruz and Kasich are getting money from the banking industries, the energy industries.
Theyre getting money from the pharmaceutical companies.
Theyre getting money from everybody.
Folks, you cant straighten out this mess  were in a mess  if you cant do what you have to do.
When millions of dollars are given to Cruz and Kasich and millions from different industries, youre not going to be able to say, "Well, were going to do and go against the banking industry to do whats right for the people" if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars.
Now, thats true with Hillary also.
Now, shes gotten millions of dollars.
But Im the only one self-funding my campaign.
Im in for a lot of money.
I in a lot of money.
What is beautiful is when I was running against Jeb in New Hampshire.
I was in for like $2 million.
Jeb was in for like $48 million.
I was in first and he was close to last.
I said, "Who do you want as your president?"
By the way, did Jeb endorse anybody yet?
Because I havent heard.
Because I think Jeb probably endorsed  huh?
Did he endorse?
It just shows you how important it is.
Nobody even knows.
I dont even know.
Hell probably  hell endorse  just so you know.
Look, when youre in war, youve got to fight and you fight hard.
When I fight, I win.
Youre going to win.
You know that.
Youre going to win.
But you know, you do pretty serious damage, right?
Because you want to win and you want to win fast and a lot of people dont love you after you finish.
But I just love you.
I dont care about that.
In fact, theyre asking Cruz, you know, at the debate which by the way they said I won every single debate.
Now I heard the other night, "I want to debate Trump".
Ive debated him 11 or 12 times.
Every single online poll has me winning the debates.
Hes an okay debater but hes a bad talker.
You know, everythings so dramatic.
And he waits.
Phony.
And he waits.
You know, you ever see he goes sentence after sentence and then he stops for like three, four seconds.
And then he goes again.
It looks like were in the theater.
Were not in the theater.
Were in the real world.
So what happens  thank you.
...By the way, the Sheriff is here and hes a great guy and his people are fantastic.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you.
I mean, the only thing I feel so guilty about all the people outside.
Feel so guilty.
Were going to come back.
Were going to come back, come back to this area.
You guys cannot come.
Okay?
All of the ladies can come but the guys cant.
But all of the people outside, were going to take a bigger place because I feel slightly guilty.
But look, we have a very serious mess on our hands.
We have a very serious situation.
We have a country thats not protected.
We have a country thats sitting on a big fat bubble thats going to explode.
In a certain way, Id say let it do now, dont do it after I get in.
Three days itll explode and theyll say its Trumps fault.
Okay?
Ayeyeye, we are in a big fat ugly bubble.
We have interest rates that are so low that if youre rich like me I can borrow money for any amount.
If youre a hardworking guy with a great farm or youre a hardworking developer or businessman you cant borrow money.
You can only borrow money really cheaply  think of how bad it is  you can borrow money for nothing practically if youre rich.
But if youre rich, you dont need the money so you dont have to borrow it.
But if youre a businessperson and you want to go to the bank for a loan, you cant get it.
The regulators are running the banks.
Dodd-Frank is a disaster, by the way.
Its a disaster.
Its a disaster.
But the biggest disasters are regulations.
Our rules and regulations are horrible.
Were going to get rid of probably 85% of them.
There are some we live with.
But weve got to go back.
So many people in this area have told me regulations  regulatory climate  is the worst theyve ever seen.
I have a friend, whos a farmer, and if a puddle forms, they consider it a lake for the purposes of environmental.
Its like a puddle and theyd consider it a lake.
So we dont know what were doing.
So heres whats happening.
Were going to make our country so great again.
Were going to make our country so strong again.
Our military is going to be so amazing.
Were never going to have to use it.
Dont forget, I didnt want to go into Iraq.
All these guys think that Im a tough guy so Im going to be so quick with the trigger.
Im not going to be quick.
I was the slowest with the trigger.
I didnt want the trigger.
Now, when Obama left though, he shouldnt have left the way he did.
He gave a certain date, and the enemy said, "It cant be possible.
Nobody would be that stupid.
Nobody."
So I actually dont think itd hurt that much because I dont think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be stupid enough to give a date  "Were leaving on this date."
And then he left.
They said, "He was serious!"
They pulled back.
They pulled back.
Then you see what happened.
They pulled back then they went in with fury.
But how about the 50 soldiers.
He sent a couple of months ago, a few months ago, he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly, quietly sending them.
What does he do?
He sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that "We are sending 50 soldiers in Iraq, Syria" and these soldiers have a big target on their backs.
Why cant we just keep our mouths shut?
Why cant we be unpredictable?
Unpredictable?
Right?
Why cant we be unpredictable?
Why does he have to tell  first of all, it doesnt even sound good when you say "50 soldiers" because it sounds like so small.
People would say, "Is that good or bad?"
I mean, that sounds small.
But then when you think about it, why do we have to say that?
These are extraordinary people.
These are our finest.
And theyre, you know, very dangerous missions.
Why would you tell people that were sending them in?
You just keep quiet and let them accomplish something.
They are right now  who knows whats happened to them?
But right now, they have a big target on their back.
People that weve let go of at Gitmo have now killed Americans.
Youve seen that.
You saw that yesterday.
That came out yesterday.
We let people go out of Gitmo and they kill Americans.
Okay.
Is anybody surprised at that though?
Would anybody be surprised?
And were keeping it open.
Now theyre spending, you know, hundreds of millions to run it.
I guarantee you could run it a lot cheaper.
Youd have a lot of money left over.
So were going to get efficiency in government.
But were going to end Obamacare.
Were going to replace it with something so much better and so much less expensive.
Were going to get rid of Common Core.
Were going to bring our education local.
We are going to preserve our Second Amendment.
Its under siege.
Its totally under siege.
And Christianity is under siege.
Ill tell you, Christianity is under siege.
You take a look.
Im with the  Ill tell you what.
Ive been with so many pastors lately and Jerry Falwell Jr. was an example  was telling me that  first of all, he told me something that "You remind me so much of my father."
I thought his father was a great guy.
What his father did with Liberty College and Liberty University.
And Jerry to top it off has taken it to a whole new place.
But when Jerry was so strong and so great.
But I was talking to  I probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors, different folks came up to my office, and theyre really under tremendous pressure because they dont want to have their tax exempt status taken away.
This happened during the Lyndon Johnson presidency.
And I said, "Why is it that you folks are pushed around so much?"
Christianity.
These are the pastors.
These are strong people.
These are really strong people.
"Why do you allow that?
Why arent you more forceful?"
And finally, somebody said, "Well, we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status."
I said when did that happen exactly?
It was during the Johnson.
Well, were going to try to get rid of that.
Okay?
Because thats really terrible.
Were going to try getting rid of  and Ive said that to a lot of evangelicals, a lot of great Christians.
Were going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion, of our religion, of Christianity, somebody thats an evangelical.
You take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless.
Theyve actually taken their right of free speech away.
So I said were going to try to get rid of that and I think well be very, very successful.
You know, its interesting.
I said how many Christians are there?
Because you know, weve got men, weve got women.
You cut it in half, weve actually have a few more women.
But we are far more Christians than we have men or women.
So in a way, its the most powerful lobbyist  the biggest group of people.
But theyre not allowed to talk because theyre petrified.
You saw what was happening with the IRS and what was taking place with regard to certain groups.
So we are going to try and usually when I say try that means Im going to get it done.
That means Im going to get it done.
But we are going to try very hard.
We are going to get that brought back and I think its going to be very hard to counter it.
Because if the Christians, and if the whole evangelical Christian sector gets together, nobody, nobody can beat 
You know, when I made the statement about banning Muslims on a temporary basis, I took such heat.
Now people are saying, "You know, Trump is sort of right about that."
Now theyre all going, "Wow" because they see whats happening.
And I think if I would have said it about Christians, I think I would have had less opposition.
Thats whats happened in this country.
Thats whats happened in our country.
And we cant let it happen.
Were going to turn this country around and were going to be the smart people.
Were not going to be the dummies anymore.
Were not going to be where China made last year trade deficits $505 billion.
Japan over $100 billion.
Mexico $58 billion.
Were going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
Okay?
...Recently, I was in Florida and Marco, whos a nice guy actually.
You notice how nice they are after youve defeated them?
I like everybody I defeat.
But when I ran against Marco, it was supposed to be...well, he started it.
Right?
Just like Cruz started the last deal.
He started it.
But Marco came after me very viciously.
You know he wanted to be Don Rickles, right?
And it didnt work.
But what happened is I won by 20 points  almost 20 points  and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues.
And frankly, I wish I would have left about two days earlier.
I wanted to stay in Florida campaign.
I wish I would have devoted two more days to Ohio because I almost won in Ohio.
I would have won in Ohio but I didnt want to take a chance leaving my beautiful Florida because I love Florida and I wanted to win that.
So if I would have left a couple of days early, I think I would have won Florida the same.
But Im not going to have anything happen in Wisconsin.
We have to win.
If we  look, we have to put these politicians in their place, folks.
Its time.
And believe me, you know, Cruz likes to pretend hes an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor.
So believe me, believe me, theyre all establishment.
And frankly in a way its worse because Cruz is establishment and yet hes got no relationship with the establishment.
He goes and he stands on the floor of the Senate for a day and a half and he filibusters, and these Senators  look, I know.
Theyre tough cookies.
I have the best  I have one of the great people  Sen. Jeff Sessions, whos great.
Nobody better than Jeff.
And you know, Cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech  "Sen. Jeff Sessions"  and then he comes out and he endorses me.
But when you think of it, look, out of all of these Senators, he has one supporter  Lee  whos his friend.
I mean, hes his friend.
And by the way took him plenty time to do it.
But you know, to stand there and to rant and rave for two days to show people you can filibuster, in the meantime, nothing was accomplished.
Cruz has not accomplished one thing.
So hes an insider but its almost like the man on the street because he cant get anything done.
He dislikes people.
He calls people like for instance he said horrible things about the Speaker and you know about the Speaker and he said about separately Mitch McConnell.
I mean, he said some terrible things about  how do you get things done when youre calling Mitch McConnell bad names.
Okay?
Lets just say bad names.
So hes sort of got the worst of all elements.
Hes an insider totally but he can get nothing done.
Okay?
He can get nothing done.
Your new Speaker  how do you like Paul Ryan?
How do you like him?
Wow.
I was told be nice to Paul Ryan because  really?
Well, hes the Speaker.
Hes a nice guy.
He called me the other day.
He was very nice.
But Im very surprised at this statement.
Wow.
Are you all Republicans?
Are you mostly conservatives?
...I always say Im just a common sense conservative.
And so, so important  common sense.
And somebody told me today that somebody else  I think, Walker  used my term.
You know, Walker used  I said, "Make America great again."
I said, "Make America great again", and I copyrighted the term.
And then Walker was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying "Make America great again" because he saw the response that I got.
The difference is he didnt get any response.
So then no.
But we told him he cant do that.
That was the first real problem I had with him...
Now, I said a common sense conservative and today I heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said hes a common sense conservative.
Well, I coined the phrase a few months ago.
Thats what I am.
I am a conservative.
Im very, very conservative on the military.
Im very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things.
But  and Im actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say "Hes not that conservative on trade because he doesnt believe in free trade."
Well, actually I do believe in free trade.
But its got to be good trade for us, right?
Its got to be smart trade.
It cant be where Wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks cant get into China but China comes in here like its Swiss cheese.
Thats what happens.
You know, China does not obey the rules.
Now, I get along great with China.
I made a fortune dealing with China.
I have two buildings because of China.
Big ones in New York and one in San Francisco  Bank of America  that I have in partnership with a great company.
And its because of China.
I sell  I have one of the big leases with one of their big banks  with the biggest bank in the world actually from China.
I sell millions of millions of condos to people from China.
I like China.
Im not angry China.
I like them.
I think their leaders are doing a great job for them.
But our leaders are doing a bad job for us.
Same with Mexico.
I get along great.
The Hispanics.
I love the Hispanics.
I love the Hispanics.
But their leaders are killing us on the border and theyre killing us on trade.
And Im not angry at them.
Im angry at our country and our leadership because its grossly incompetent and were going to change it around and were going to get the best and were going to get the finest.
...So whatever you can do to spread the world, Ill be around.
Im going to Green Bay.
I love their team, by the way.
You talk about a great franchise.
No, I love it.
And you have a truly great quarterback.
I dont know.
Hes probably endorsing somebody else but I dont care.
Hes still a great quarterback.
Tom Bradys a friend of mine.
He said you have a great quarterback.
Thats all right with me.
When Tom says hes a great quarterback thats pretty good.
But you know, I really want to win Wisconsin because if we could win Wisconsin, were going to put all of this stupidity away.
Were going to put these stupid, stupid people that allow and Im talking about basically politicians, and in many cases, you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and I mean take a look at the Iran deal.
How bad is that I mean, just as a deal...
But many times people will say deals that the country makes, and theyll say, "How can our politicians be so stupid?"
Theyre not stupid.
Theyre being hit by the lobbyists and the special interests and they make a fortune.
Okay?
They get tremendous campaign contributions.
Theyre not stupid.
Theyre doing it for themselves.
So again, Im not doing that.
Im doing for you.
Im working for you.
But just remember, theyre not so stupid like you think.
But when you look at the people funding Cruzs campaign and Kasichs campaign, and you look  dont forget  Cruz said, "Oh the banks, the banks."
You know, hes going to be Robin Hood.
Hes going to be this great guy.
And then in her personal financial disclosure form, he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks  Citibank and Goldman Sachs.
He borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have  a very low interest rate.
Almost no interest.
He forgot to announce it on his personal financial disclosure form.
He just forgot.
He said, "Oh, I forgot.
I forgot."
Okay?
So then he hits the banks.
Hes controlled by these people, folks.
Okay?
I mean, what he did was absolutely wrong.
But theyre controlled by these people.
Im controlled by you.
Im going to do the right thing for you.
Okay?
So remember that.
...
Q&A






22 veterans a day commit suicide.
Thats correct.
Were going to take care of our veterans so much.
Look, let me tell you, they  many of them kill themselves waiting for a doctor.
They cant even get to see the doctor.
You know that.
They end up killing themselves before they see the doctor.
22 a day and a lot of people dont even believe that number.
They think its almost like an impossible number  how can it be so bad?
and it actually could be even worse than that.
We are going to take care of them.
From their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more  six, seven, eight days.
And sometimes theyll see the doctor and the doctor says, "I cant see you now.
Im going on vacation."
You see the corruptness.
I just left Phoenix  21,000 people.
Sheriff Joe was there.
The job he did was incredible.
Incredible.
You know they had a little protest.
Right?
That protest ended so quickly.
He arrested three people; everyone else scattered.
You know, and you have that kind of a Sheriff here.
You have a tough cookie here.
I can tell you.
I just met him and I can tell you.
But you know I have a great policy plan and Ive gotten a lot of credit for it and its on DonaldJTrump.com.
And with the veterans when theyre waiting for exorbitant time  even for a little time  theyre going to go to the doctor.
Theyre going to go to local doctors or local hospitals.
Many of the hospitals are dying for business.
You know that theyre dying.
Some of these hospitals are dying.
Theyre going to get immediate treatment, immediate service, were going to pay the bills, and were going to save a fortune, and theyre going to get great service.
And everybody is in love with it.
Everybody loves it.
And thats whats going to happen.
So were going to take care of our veterans.
If we cant take care of our veterans, we cant take care of anyone.
So were going to take care of our vets.
Boy, do you look good though.
You look good and tough.
I wouldnt want to fight you.
Do you think I can take you in a fight?
I dont think so.
How about we do it right now?
That would be great for television...
Go ahead.
...Let me tell you this.
Our veterans are taken worse care of than illegal immigrants who come in our country...You dont even have to write it down.
Were going to do things about it.
You know what youre saying?
Ive heard this so many times before with the daycare and everything else.
We are going to take care of our vets.
By the ways, speaking of increase, Cruz and Kasich want to destroy your Social Security, folks, okay?
I want to bring money back into this country.
I want to bring jobs into this country.
I want to bring tremendous wealth into this country.
I want to take our wealth back from China, from Mexico, from all of these countries that have our wealth.
Theyve taken them like were a bunch of babies.
And were going to save your Social Security and were going to save your Medicare.
They want to get rid of it.
Okay?
Remember that.
...
I want to use not too many executive orders folks.
You know, because executive orders came about more recently.
Nobody ever heard of an executive order.
Then all of a sudden Obama, because he couldnt get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like theyre butter.
So I want to do away with executive orders for the most part.
But look, just do me a favor.
Stick with me.
Youre going to be okay.
All right?
...I know, what youve said Ive heard a hundred times and daycare is a huge problem.
Huge problem.
And your wife not working?
Huge problem  she cant.
So anyway, I bet you have a great wife.
Good wife?
Better believe it.
...Were ending Common Core.
Youre not going to be educated  your kids in Wisconsin are no longer going to be educated in Washington, D.C. by bureaucrats  many of whom  I cant say all  but many of whom dont care for your kids.
They couldnt care less.
They get big, fat salaries.
Your kids are going to be educated locally.
Were terminating Common Core, and you will see something thats magic.
And Ive seen it where parents and all of these people  the uncles, the aunts  theyre all on the school boards.
They get professionals.
They have great principals.
You cant see whats going on from Washington, D.C.
Many of the people never even come here.
They sit behind their desk in Washington.
They draw big salaries.
And theyre telling you how to educate their kids.
Not going to happen that way.
And Ive even seen it where they keep graduates  the child graduates and those parents stay on.
They love it because their child went through the system.
They love it and they become so good at it.
Thats whats going to happen.
Were one of the worst in the world in education.
Were going to be one of the better ones.
Not necessarily  you know, I dont know that were going to beat Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and China.
But were going to come very close.
Discipline in schools.
I dont think that Wisconsin should have a big problem with discipline.
You have a big problem with discipline?
...Well, we have to get discipline back in the country, forget about school.
We have to get discipline 
I mean, I have a case.
I have a wonderful guy  campaign manager.
You talk about discipline.
And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager.
Hes a good guy.
Corey [Lewandowski].
And by the way, the easiest thing  "Corey, youre fired."
I cant do that.
Cant do it.
So fortunately, I have a taping system.
You know, very  Im rich so I have tapes all over.
So this young woman who complained, was all  she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this.
I said, "Oh, thats horrible."
And then we saw the tapes.
Did anybody see the tape?
What did you think?
Right?
Nothing.
Women  what did you think?
[Audience response inaudible]...
I mean, she wasnt like  her face stayed the same.
If somebody squeezed your arm or did something really bad  dont forget  initially she said thrown to the floor.
But if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldnt you start screaming or something?
Did you see any change in her face?
[Audience response inaudible]
...Its horrible.
Its horrible.
Honestly, its horrible.
And the best thing I could do is say  but I cant destroy a man.
Id destroy him.
Got a beautiful wife and children and Im not going to destroy a man for that.
And you know what?
When I saw that at the tape, at first I said, "Oh, this is terrible."
Then I saw the tape.
Its my tape.
Im the one that had the tape.
Its on the ceiling of this incredible club in Jupiter, Florida, and were all leaving and we have a press conference.
Right?
And the press conference lasted a long time.
It was like 45 minutes.
So that was enough.
Im leaving with a whole big gang of people.
People pushing left and right, left and right.
And all of a sudden, she bolts into the picture.
She grabs me or hits me on the arm.
In fact, Im like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit.
But I didnt  it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me.
Right?
[Audience response inaudible]
Like he was helping her.
And did you see her fall to the ground?
[Audience response inaudible]
Okay, because she talked about falling to  now after, I must tell you, her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground.
You know, all this.
I could read it to you.
Does anybody want to hear it?
I mean, I want to be accurate because Id like the press to treat me.
So before she knew she was on tape, she said "I was jolted backwards."
Was she jolted backwards?
I mean, if she was, her face stayed the same.
I mean.
"I was jolted backwards.
Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down.
Campaign managers arent supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, except she never went to the ground.
She never even came  flinched.
She didnt  you know, if somebody grabbed you even one of the guys, even the bikers, if somebody grabs even a biker or punches you a little bit, youre "Whoa!"
Right?
I mean, the toughest guy, the toughest woman.
Look at her face.
Its zero.
Theyre going to destroy a mans life?
And then I have Cruz saying, "Oh, that was a terrible thing.
That was a terrible thing."
Let me tell you something, folks.
If I win, if I lose, I didnt need to do this.
Im doing this because I just had a beautiful grandchild with Ivanka.
Ivanka and Jared  beautiful, beautiful grandchild.
Its my eighth.
Im doing this all for them.
I didnt need to do this.
This is not so easy.
And I had no idea.
You know, maybe none of us did.
You know, I had no idea the message was going to get across.
Its a message of competence.
It really is.
Its a message of common sense and its a message of competence.
And I had no idea that wed have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff Mitt Romney  a total stiff  who by the way hes a dope.
Hes not a smart person.
Ill tell you right now.
Let me tell you about Mitt Romney.
That was an election he should have won and he lost.
And he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what?
Thats an election that should have been won.
And Ill tell you what.
I helped John McCain and at that time, honestly, that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of collapsing.
But he lost.
And I helped Mitt Romney a lot and he lost.
And I said, "This time, were going to do it ourselves.
Were going to win.
Were going to win."
So just remember that.
Were going to win because of Wisconsin, I hope...
Right!
Shes so smart.
I dont want them to know.
I dont want to tell Putin what Im thinking.
Shes so smart.
What you just said...what about Ukraine?
Dont worry about Ukraine.
Ukraine is going to be fine.
Just dont ask me why.
You know, this world of politics  "Mr. Trump, you said -" dont forget Im the one that said take the oil.
I was right.
They didnt take the oil.
You know who has the oil right now?
ISIS has the oil.
You know, that Libya  ISIS has all that oil from Gaddafi, all of that big oil from Gaddafi.
He took it.
Were like a bunch of dummies.
Why arent we embargoing?
Why arent we creating a nice big circle so they cant get the oil out?
Why arent we taking that oil back?
Look, look, look, Im the one that says though I dont want to say everything.
If I win, I have a good chance of winning.
Im the frontrunner by a lot.
I want to go in there.
I want to knock the hell out of ISIS.
I dont want to tell all.
I really mean this.
I dont want to tell everybody in this room  and look at all the cameras that are going now  I dont want to tell the world what Im going to do because theyre watching.
Just let me do it folks.
I will do it.
You would be so happy.
You dont have to know the details.
Okay?
Let me do it.
You know, I used the word before.
We have to be a little bit unpredictable.
We cant say, "Well, were going and attack on March 14th and then were going to hit them from the front and then were going to hit them from the back."
You know, Obama did that eight months ago with one of the cities.
He said, "Were going in next week."
Look, folks, folks, folks, you know, you have to trust  there has to be some trust.
Right?
Do you trust?
Weve got to stop the stupid.
Thats why I really think your question is so great  "I dont want to hear how youre going to do it, Mr. Trump.
Just do it."
Ill do it.
Okay?
I love that.
That woman!
That woman!
Thank you, honey.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can see why.
Woman:
Thank you.
You have been  I just want to say thank you.
You saved me in so many ways.
In recent years, Ive been struggling with an incurable illness and Im on home care now.
Its caused by a doctors medical negligence.
And in those dark days fighting  right now all the tubes have been removed and I have a Do Not Resuscitate Order and I have a seven-year-old son  in those days in the hospital, I received from you a handwritten letter that said, "To the bravest woman I know."
I remember that.
I remember that.
Such a wonderful, beautiful woman.
I mean, just an amazing woman.
And are you coming along okay?
Woman:
No, sir.
But thats okay because Im here right now to thank you in person and that was my biggest dream.
And I wanted to thank you because through you and your organizations, my son whos Mexican-American, seven-years-old, through your organization and just being able to stand on that stage with you back in 2005 the outpouring of love that can from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college.
Thats great.
And you know what well do?
Were going to watch him.
Youre going to watch him.
Were going to be watching your boy.
Okay?
But youre going to be hopefully around.
Youre not going to have to have anybody watching.
Youre going to hopefully be around.
Those doctors are going to be so wrong.
But well be helping you.
Woman:
So we thank you.
God bless you.
And just, you know, hes a Mexican-American, and you because of your efforts have sent him to college.
And I have been writing letters to him for when Im in heaven to tell him that what youve done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us.
Thats so nice.
Thank you.
I have to go down and say hello.
Is that okay?
...Very sad but I think its going to be really a story of hope and something that is really great is going to happen out of that.
You watch.
But it sort of tells me when I first said this people would say, "Oh, it will cost a lot."
Forgetting about the campaign.
Thats peanuts by comparison.
You know, Ive spent tens of millions of dollars.
But the big thing  I lost certain businesses and I owned the Miss Universe Pageant.
I bought it very inexpensively many years ago  15 years ago  and because of the fact that they thought I was against this woman or that one, I had a hard time with television.
Now, the good news is I sold it for a wonderful  I was very happy with that.
But I didnt want to sell it.
But I sold it and I built it to really a great company.
We did a great job with that company  Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA.
But other businesses  I sort of  like the shirts and the ties with Macys.
Macys was unbelievably disloyal because of illegal immigration and they ended the shirts, ties.
Who care?
I mean, thats not a big deal.
But Im doing something  nobody is giving up what Im giving.
I mean, when Cruz runs, he runs.
If he wins, great.
If he loses, great.
You know, its him.
Hes a politician.
They just  they run, they win, they lose, who knows?
But these guys run for office.
Thats all they do.
Ive always heard that if youre a very successful person, you cant run for office, especially for president.
You just cant run for president, and I can see it.
I have so much false press about me.
Things that are so false.
You know, I saw the other day on television, there were like 56,000 negative ads on me.
56,000.
In fact, in Florida, I own Doral and in Florida we had the tournament there two weeks.
Adam Scott  the great Adam Scott  the great golfer.
He was winning.
And in between shots, I told you this after the victory speech, in between they have commercials and they were all about Trump.
Negative, horrible, negative commercials.
Mostly false.
Mostly.
Not all false.
But mostly false, I have to be honest.
But it came out the other day, I think it said "$68 million, 55,000 negative ads."
Negative ads.
And when I was running in Florida, I said "How is it possible to win?"
I mean, with all of this because I knew it.
You couldnt turn on in Florida where I was you couldnt turn on the television without seeing Trump commercials.
Sometimes four or five in a row.
And they were horrendous.
Done by very, very bad people.
Very bad, evil people.
And I said, "How it is possible to win?"
And God helped me.
Honestly.
Because I won in a landslide.
I won by almost 20%.
And now theyre doing it here.
Club for Growth.
Its a crooked outfit.
Look, Club for Growth  you ever hear this?
Club for Growth  a friend of mine, hes a conservative guy.
He goes would you do me a favor?
See Club for Growth.
I said, "Whats Club for Growth?"
He said, "They want to talk to you."
I said, "All right.
Send them up."
Hes a friend.
Hes a good guy.
And now Im in politics so I have to see people I wouldnt normally...
So Club for Growth, they come up to my office.
This guy was I think a former Congressman.
And he tells me a little bit about Club for Growth and Im falling asleep.
And then he goes, "$1 million."
And I said, "$1 million for what?
I dont even know you.
Ive never met you."
I said, "Do me a favor."
Im trying to be nice and I said, "Go back and write me a little note if you can."
And he was stupid enough to write me a note.
He writes me a letter asking for $1 million.
I let him know that Im not interested.
You could be rich.
Id rather take a million and throw it all over this room.
Id rather give it to you, to your boy.
...They write me a letter.
Its like extortion.
They asked me for a $1 million.
I said no nicely.
And then theyre doing ads all over Wisconsin.
Club for Growth.
They did it all over Florida.
Club for Growth.
About eminent domain.
By the way, without eminent domain, you wouldnt have highways, you wouldnt have hospitals, you wouldnt have bridges.
You need eminent domain.
If somethings in your way and youre building a highway, if youre producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someones property, every once in a while.
You know, its funny.
These guys all want the Keystone Pipeline.
Right?
Everyone.
Conservatives.
Conservatives want the Keystone Pipeline.
I like the Keystone Pipeline too.
But they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldnt go 15 feet.
They wouldnt be able to build it.
So, they dont want eminent domain.
They do commercials about eminent domain.
They love the Keystone Pipeline, and the whole Keystone Pipeline is based around eminent domain because youve got to go from Canada, where Cruz was born, to Texas, where hes representing.
Think of it.
This guy  and dont forget that.
Remember what I said.
Im going to win.
Just remember what I said.
Im going to win.
And I thank you...
Im going to win.
But remember this.
If for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing  remember, Im a good prognosticator, Im a good predictor  the first thing thats going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue Ted Cruz.
He was born in Canada.
He lived there for four years.
The head of the Harvard Law School, one of the top people in the business in terms of Constitution, is saying that, you know, hes wrong.
And we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that.
Remember this.
If Cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesnt get  because its all establishment.
You know, if I go into that whole mess of the convention, Im not the establishment.
I dont take their money.
I dont hire their people.
I dont do any of that stuff.
Okay?
So you have a disadvantage.
But if Cruz wins, remember what I said.
Just remember.
Again, hes not going to win.
But if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the Democrats that he doesnt have the right to be president.
And I think theyre right because he wasnt born on our soil.
He wasnt born.
Hes not a natural born citizen.
Hes not a natural born citizen.
I dont like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody.
He is not a natural born citizen.
So if for some reason he should get the nomination, I really believe youre wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because youre going to have somebody thats going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit.
Again, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a Canadian citizen joint with U.S. until 14 or 15 months ago.
Did anyone know that?
So he was a senator from Texas, only because of the great Sarah Palin by the way, without Sarah Palin, he could have never won that election.
It was a fluke.
But he was a Senator from Texas.
He lived  he was a joint citizen.
Now, he finally gave up his citizenship to Canada like 16 months ago.
He said, "Oh, I didnt know I was a citizen of Canada also."
Just like he didnt know that Goldman Sachs and Citibank gave him money.
I mean, this guy is  you just have to study him, folks.
Look, again, Im doing this.
Were going to win.
Were going to turn this country around.
Were going to make America great again.
Were going to win a lot.
But you have to know the facts.
I love you all.
I love you all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Get out there and vote!
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you very much everybody.
This was an amazing evening.
This was a great evening.
They just announced North Carolina.
I dont know if theyve even announced Illinois yet but were leading by a lot so I think theyre going to announce it.
Florida was so amazing.
And I want to thank our friends.
Northern Marianas Islands have been so incredible, and we picked up nine delegates this morning.
I heard very early in the morning  nine delegates.
Thats a lot.
And I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman [James] Ada who was a fantastic man and that was a very nice start to the day.
That I can tell you.
Many things have been happening over the last short period of time.
CNN was very nice.
They came up with a poll.
The poll said 49% to 14% and 15%.
We just had one from the Economist just came out  53%.
And it was sort of interesting because I was watching the news a little while ago and one of the commentators, who Im not particularly fond of but these are minor details, said "But Donald Trump doesnt get over 50%" because Im at 43%, 45%.
Actually now according to the Economist, Im at 53%.
And I have to explain to these people they dont understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it.
When I dont get over 50%, we have four people.
Right?
We have four people.
Do you understand that?
So when I get 53%  and this one is an example, I had 53% and thats with four people.
Thats an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%.
So someday, someday theyre going to understand, someday when we take it all, theyll understand.
But it is really ridiculous.
I want to thank my family.
My boy, Eric and Don.
Theyve been working so hard.
Ivanka and Jared have been amazing.
Ivankas home right now.
In about two minutes, Ill call her.
Shes about to have a baby so I dont know.
Weve been thinking about that now for a little while but Ivanka has been so helpful and Jared has been amazing and its been just great.
I want to thank Barron for putting up with the fact that I never see him anymore.
And I want to thank Barron.
I never see my Barron and its his birthday on Sunday so were very happy about that.
So its a little tough.
You know, were going away and he goes, "When are you going to be come home, daddy?
When are you coming home?"
I said, "Well, in about two and a half weeks."
Its been pretty tough.
Youre traveling all over the place.
Its really amazing.
Yesterday I went up to Ohio.
I went up to Youngstown.
We had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country.
We have so, so many great people.
We will someday in the not so distant future if I win  otherwise its not going to happen I have to be honest with you.
But Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam and all of 
And were not going to be losing our companies.
You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether its Carrier air conditioning, whether its Ford, whether its Eaton.
I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp. theyre leaving and so many companies are leaving.
And frankly, Im disgusted with it and Im tired of seeing it and theres no reason for it.
Its just gross incompetence at the highest level.
We should not allow it to happen.
Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, theyre going to Ireland.
And theres so many more.
You have corporate inversions.
You have people who cant get their money back into the country because the politicians cant get along.
They cant make a deal.
Everybody agrees  Democrat and Republican  everybody agrees the money should come back...trillion dollars outside of this country.
Everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years havent been able to make a deal.
And we could make a deal.
Theres an example of something that you could do if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what youre doing because everybody wants to do it.
And companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which were going to lower by the way.
But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money thats their money because theres no way of bringing it in.
So, weve got a long way to go.
But I think at some point its going to get done.
This has been very exciting, this whole process.
We started, I was one of 17 people  senators, governors.
Ive had such great support.
Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us.
Great guy.
Great guy.
Wonderful man.
And Chris Christie endorsed us.
That was so incredible.
And today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us.
She was great.
She is a truly wonderful woman, of the job shes done in Florida is incredible.
You know, so many  weve had such incredible support.
Paul Ryan called me the other day  tremendous call.
I spoke with Mitch McConnell today.
We had a great conversation.
The fact is we have to bring our party together.
We have to bring it together.
We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world.
Everybodys writing about it all over Europe, all over the world theyre talking about it.
Millions of people are coming in to vote.
This was an example of it today.
Many, many more people.
Im looking at the polling booths.
Im looking at the different polling booths all around the country where its up.
And the lines are four, five, six blocks long.
And the woman  one woman was there for 40 years.
Shes been working the polls.
And she said, "Wed have two people here.
Wed have three people.
Now look at the line."
And the line looked like it was, you know, long.
It was really long.
Five deep and long.
And its just a different thing.
We have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before.
Its an incredible thing.
I want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarahs husband.
Sarah was here.
She was incredible.
She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her.
And what happened is he was in a very bad accident.
Hes tough as nails.
Hes going to be fine.
But I just wanted to pay my respects by the way to Todd.
So, our theme when we started and Melania and I came down.
Yeah, sit down everybody.
Please.
I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago.
We give you seats.
You dont have to stand.
Im looking at all these people.
Cory, good job, Cory.
Good job.
And Hope and our whole squad.
Right?
So when this began, Melania and I and I said, "Got to do it."
And she was so supportive and shes been so supportive.
Its been amazing.
And we have to do it.
We came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders.
And what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were  we shot right up.
I shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail.
We went up in June.
Most people said Ill never run.
Hes just going to have fun.
Hes having a good time.
This isnt necessarily  I mean, Im having a good time.
You know, Im having a very nice time.
But you know what?
Im working very hard and there is great anger.
Believe me.
There is great anger.
One of the broadcasters was saying, "Is there anger?"
And I said...I was supposed to say, "No, theres not.
We love the way things are working.
We love the deal you made with Iran.
Its wonderful.
You give them $150 billion.
We get nothing.
We love all the deals.
The trade deals are wonderful.
You lose $500 billion a year with China.
We lose $58 billion a year in terms of imbalance.
Its a total imbalance."
We dont make good deals anymore.
We dont win anymore.
As a country, we dont win anymore.
And they asked, "Is there anger from your people?"
...Theyre not angry people but they want to see the country properly run.
They want to see borders.
They want to see good health care.
They want to see things properly taken care of.
They want our military rebuilt.
Our military is in a very bad state.
They want it rebuilt.
Very, very importantly, and they want the Second Amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and thats going to happen.
And you know what they want so badly?
They want our veterans taken care of.
Our veterans are treated so badly.
So, we started and something happened called Paris.
Paris happened and Paris was a disaster.
That was  there have been many disasters.
But it was Paris.
And then we had a case in Los Angeles where it was in California where the 14 young people were killed.
And it just goes on and on and on.
And what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals.
Were going to make the best trade deals youve ever seen.
Weve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business.
And these people are going to be negotiating our deals and theyre the best in the world.
We have the best business people in the world.
Were going to have such great deals.
Were going to do so good with trade.
Were going to do so good on the border.
But it took on a whole new meaning, and the meaning was very simple.
We need protection in our country and thats going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up.
And Im just very proud to be a part of this.
I think were going to go.
Were going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but I think were going to have a great victory.
And I think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again.
This country is going to start winning again.
We dont win anymore.
We dont win with our military.
We cant beat ISIS.
Were going to knock the hell out of them.
We dont win at trade  China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country.
Anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us.
We dont win at trade.
Were going to win at trade.
Were going to make our country rich again.
Were going to make our country great again.
And we need the rich in order to make the great, Im sorry to tell you.
So, Im going forward.
We had a fantastic evening.
I would have never thought this could have happened.
I guess were waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also.
But to win the states that weve won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, Florida.
To win by that kind of a number is incredible.
Its record-setting.
And I have to say that number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign.
Hes tough.
Hes smart.
And hes got a great future.
Hes got a great future.
But I have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have.
Record, record, record.
By the way, mostly false.
I wouldnt say 100% but about 90%.
Mostly false, vicious, horrible.
They said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million.
It added up to over $40 million.
And you explain it to me because I cant  my numbers went up.
I dont understand it.
Nobody understands it.
My numbers went up.
I mean, its been an interesting experience.
Last week, Adam Scott won at the Trump National Doral.
Won the big tournament, the world championship of golf.
And Adam, whos a great guy  I guess a lot of you folks saw that  but Im watching...we have television screens all over.
Were down at this gorgeous green at Doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on.
The worst commercial and Im with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives, and Im saying, "Look over there!
Look!
Dont watch it.
Dont.
You dont want to watch it."
Im saying, "Isnt the grass beautiful?
Look!
Look!
Dont watch."
And they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal.
And then Adam comes in.
Hes this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament.
Hes a great champion.
And were giving the award.
And just before we break for a commercial, "Well be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott" and heres the commercial and I said, "No!"
And it was two of them  two of them.
Oh, what a day that was.
What a disaster.
What a disaster.
Unbelievable.
So again, I just want to congratulate everybody.
This is a really interesting process.
Its an amazing process.
Its very tough.
But it is  by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because theres nothing like it.
Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people.
Its true.
Some are nice.
Some are nice.
Some really disgusting people back there.
And I just want to say were going to go forward and were going to win.
But more importantly, were going to win for the country.
Were going to win, win, win, and were not stopping.
Were going to have great victories for our country.
Thank you very much everybody!
Thank you!
...So its so important.
You getting out to vote.
Its just so important because our country has been taken away from us.
Its going so fast.
And you know, youre talking about Second Amendment because I was asking with Randy and a lot of people, I was talking to some of the people before, "What would you like me to focus on?"
and they said, "Just Second Amendment.
Second Amendment."
Now, the Second Amendment means a lot of other things too...The Second Amendment in under siege.
You know that.
You know that very well.
We lost a great Supreme Court justice and nobody thought this was going to be part of the equation.
And all of a sudden if somebody gets in thats the wrong person, theyll take away that Second Amendment so fast your head will spin.
You see Bloomberg is somebody that wants to knock out the Second Amendment.
Hillary is a disaster on the Second Amendment.
No, they want to take it away.
So, its just not going to happen.
Its not going to happen.
...But we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great Second Amendment person.
I just heard coming up, you know, the Senators.
Weve been very disappointed.
Im a Republican.
Many of you are Republicans.
But were not being protected whether its a budget.
You saw the budget that was approved a month ago.
It was approved by the Republicans.
They gave it away.
They gave Obama everything.
So Obama wants to put in a Supreme Court judge.
He said he wants  hes going to be a very negative person to guns because thats the way it is, okay?
Believe me, that will be the way it is.
And basically they dont have the right to do that.
But I keep saying, "Well, are the Republicans going to fail or are they going to crack?
Whats going to happen?"
And coming up today, I hear, "Well, there could be a way of Obama pushing it through."
Here we go, right?
Here we go.
Same thing you heard with Obamacare.
Its going to be defeated.
Its going to be repealed.
Were going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Believe me.
But  I mean, look whats going on with your premiums.
35%, 45%, 55% up.
Your deductible is so high.
I mean, youve got to see that truck right there?
Youve got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it.
So, I come up and Im hearing that Obama now who said by the way yesterday, "Donald Trump will not be the president.
He will not be."
No, its a compliment.
Look, hes been perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States.
So its a compliment.
But he was all over the place yesterday.
Said, "Donald Trump will not be  " I think we have maybe a little surprise in store, and we start right here in South Carolina.
You know, New Hampshire was so amazing.
We had a big, big victory in New Hampshire.
Amazing people.
And then we come down here and I said, "You know, I think we have an ever bigger lead over here."
And the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak.
Even this.
I know that four years ago, you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your frontrunner and hes a good frontrunner, a good guy, and he did well but you had 400 people, 200 people.
You have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and I wont forget it.
Believe me, Im not going to forget it.
Im not going to forget it.
So I hear that theyre talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the Second Amendment and a judge that  and this is one of many.
This is one of many but a judge that doesnt want to do a number on the guns and that doesnt know how important it is.
Were just not going to let it happen.
Okay?
Its not going happen.
And if we elected, we know that.
But we have 9 months, 10 months to go.
We have to have the Republicans hold fast because Im just hearing these little cracks, saying "Well, maybe if he appoints somebody, maybe we could get along, maybe."
Its not the way its supposed to be.
Now, its possible that theyll have their wish because if they win, theyre going to be having their choice.
But if they dont win, were going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe Supreme Court judges.
This was not supposed to be one in question.
This was a very sad circumstance that happened with  I mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance.
But now were going to see what happens.
I will only tell you this.
We are doing well.
We have a really good chance to win.
If we can win in South Carolina, were going to go  I mean, we could very well run the table.
I dont know if you saw  I guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in Nevada.
Its going to be phenomenal.
The relationship there to the people...Bush is 1% in Nevada.
This guy  why doesnt he just give up, just go home?
Go home.
Go home to mom.
Got to go home to mommy.
You know, Bush is only at 1% in Nevada.
A couple of them are, you know, at 10%, 11%, or 12%.
Im at like 40% something  48%.
So I think were going to do well.
Then I think we have the SEC.
Were going to have the SEC, which is going to be I think amazing.
But really now were starting.
New Hampshire could not have been better.
They gave us a tremendous send-off.
They really started us on our way.
And we did well in Iowa.
I mean, some votes were stolen from Ben Carson, which by the way was a disgrace.
What Cruz  what this guy Cruz did with Ben Carson was an absolute disgrace.
What he did was  he stole.
Its theft.
And then they come out with a voter violation form, which is a fraud as far as Im concerned.
And what he did with that whole thing was a disgrace.
So were not going to let that stuff happen anymore.
I mean, were not going to let it.
We will not let it happen.
Were all watching.
Youre all watching.
Keep your eyes wide open.
These politicians  heres a guy, he raises the Bible and yet he tells fibs, he tells lies, and then he does this stuff to Carson and he does other things.
Very bad.
So politicians are bad people.
Boy, they are bad.
Would you believe it?
So were not going to let it happen and were going to get in there...So Saturday.
Go out and vote.
This is going to be the place thats really going to make it.
And honestly, Ive been watching all the pundits.
Now, the bad news is theyre always wrong.
They all said Im not running and I ran.
Well, how is he going to do?
Hes just doing this for fun.
Im not doing this for fun.
Believe me, I love this location but I know I can be someplace else.
Okay?
I could be someplace else right now.
I could be very happy.
But Im doing it because you know the expression and I see all the hats in the audience  Make America great again.
We are going to make America so ... ...
We are going to win again.
You know, we dont win very much.
Youre very smart, tough people.
You like to win.
Right?
This guy over here.
You like to win.
And we dont win anymore.
We used to win.
We dont win anymore.
Well, were going to start winning again.
Were going to start winning again.
So, Second Amendment protected.
Common Core.
Were going to end Common Core.
Were bringing your education locally.
Its going to be fabulous.
I dont know if you know or if youve heard me say we have the absolute worst  we spend number one in the world on education.
Right?
Number one per pupil in the world.
There is no second place because were so high, so much  you have China, you have Norway, you have Denmark, you have Sweden.
You have these countries are the best in terms of education and theyre on the list the best.
And the 30th in the top 30  were number 30th.
Okay?
Were number one in costs.
Thats a little bit like what Im doing.
Im the least spent money.
You know, Im funding my own campaign.
Right?
So, I dont have a lot of the people coming to me.
You know, the drug companies and all of the  because if you would see the kind of waste, fraud, and corruption in the United States, a lot of it isnt really waste, fraud, and corruption.
Its the fact that people that are running against me and people in the Senate, people in Congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and theyre special interests and they do what those people want.
And thats one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack.
The military orders equipment they dont even want and the stuff they do want they dont get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, its not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we dont want.
Its going to all change because Im not getting any money from all of these people.
I dont give a damn.
I mean, were going to do the right thing.
Were going to absolutely do the right thing.
Ill tell you a little story.
So the drug companies.
We are the largest purchasers of drugs in the world, the United States...which makes a lot of sense I guess.
But we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which were going to end.
Okay?
Were going to build a wall.
Yup.
Folks, by the way, were going to build a wall and whos going to pay for the wall?
[Audience: "Mexico"]
You better believe it.
We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion.
And these characters come up, these politicians that Im running against, "You dont really think Mexico is going to pay for the wall?"
I said, "Absolutely, 100%."
They said, "How are you going to get Mexico to pay?"
And I dont want to get into it because they wont understand it.
I mean, they have no concept of business.
They have no  you know, the $150 billion we gave to Iran, these people have no concept.
We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico.
Okay?
The wall is going to cost $12 billion.
Maybe less.
If I build it, itll be taller, better, and less.
Okay?
So you think of this.
So you think of this.
So they said, "How are you going to possibly do it?"
They make so much money.
Plus we give them subsidy.
They make so much money from the United States its going to be one of the easiest things.
And I dont know if youve heard, one of the presidents or ex-presidents of Mexico held a news conference.
He said, "We will never ever, ever pay for the wall."
And the press called me.
They said, "They said they will never pay for the wall."
I said, "Who was it?"
Calderon.
Hes very nice, good guy.
I said, "Tell him the following.
The wall just got 10 feet higher."
I mean it.
It got 10 feet higher.
Yeah, theyre going to pay for it.
And I get along great with Mexico.
The problem is  I mean, they buy apartments.
I have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are Hispanics who Im doing great with.
We have such an amazing relationship with Hispanics and theyre great people.
The problem is the leaders of Mexico are too smart for our leaders.
Theyre too smart.
Theyre too cunning.
You look at whats going on.
Its unbelievable.
The border is a disaster.
Its a sieve.
People flow over.
Its not going to happen anymore, folks.
People can come into our country but theyre going to come in legally.
Theyre going to come in through a process.
Theyre going to come in, theyre going to come in legally.
So with trade, were going to solve the trade problem.
I dont know if you saw Carrier air conditioner announced two days ago theyre moving to Mexico.
Nabisco.
Theyre moving their big plant from Chicago to Mexico.
Ford, theyre moving this massive complex  theyre building a $2.5 billion plant and now theyve just announced theyre building it bigger.
Ive been talking about this for two years.
Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal, they announced theyre building it bigger.
In another words, theyre doubling down.
You know why?
Nobody does anything about it.
Im going to do something about it.
So I watched  somebody asked, "What would you do about Carrier?"
Because that was a sad case.
Somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them, "Youre out of work.
Youre out of job.
Forget it.
Its over.
Were moving to Mexico."
Are crying.
Grown men that have been there for a long time.
Really incredible people.
And theyre crying and theyre devastated and they lost their job and theyve never had another job and now this plant  this whole thing is moving to Mexico.
And they said, "What would you do?"
I said Ill tell you what Im going to do because you know they talk about free trade.
Im a free trader.
But I say oh if I put a tax on these characters  these idiots.
I mean, theyre like stupid.
They say "Donald Trump is not a true conservative because he taxes."
Its got to be fair stuff, folks.
Its got to be fair.
Im a conservative person.
Hey, Im the most conservative on the border.
Im the most conservative with the military.
Nobodys tougher than me.
Im the most conservative.
We are going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful, nobodys ever going to mess with us, folks.
We wont have to use it.
Im the most conservative on taking care of the vets.
Our vets are treated horribly.
Were going to take care of our  Im the most conservative on Common Core.
Were ending Common Core  I told you that  and were moving it locally.
And nobody is more conservative and we call toughness but nobody is more conservative on the Second Amendment.
So all of these things.
But with Carrier...theyre coming across and theyre going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from Mexico  probably  weve probably given them subsidies.
They probably have the United States giving subsidies to move out of the country.
Thats how stupid it is and thats how stupid were running...They said, "What would you do?"
I say its very easy.
We call them.
We say lets have a meeting.
Heres the story folks.
Youre moving to Mexico.
Congratulations.
But if you dont stay in the United States youre going to have a problem.
But heres what you do it.
You want to move to Mexico, build your factory, its going to be wonderful.
Hire your people theyre not from the United States.
All those people are now looking for jobs.
Those are good jobs.
You know were hiring a lot of part-timers now...The numbers are totally phony.
The 5%  totally phony numbers.
So I say heres what were going to do.
Very simple.
You build your plant in Mexico.
Enjoy yourselves.
And youre going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the United States?
No, youre going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner.
Its true.
Its the only thing you can do.
And you know what?
Its the only thing you can do.
Theres nothing else.
Because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop?
And then you have the devaluation with China.
The all-time.
Theyre like grand chess masters or grand  I mean these people are the greatest  the greatest in history.
Theyre grandmasters of that  devaluation.
They devalue their currency.
Japan is doing very well too.
Theyre killing Caterpillar.
You know, theyre ordering Komatsu tractors now because theyve devalued  look, you take a look at whats happened to the Yen and its very hard.
A friend a mine.
Hes a big excavator.
You all know excavators.
I love excavators.
This guys a very big one.
He buys Caterpillar tractors all the time and excavators.
He just put in a big order for Komatsu.
Not that he wanted to.
He said, "Donald, they made it impossible for me not to buy.
Theyve devalued the yen to such an extent  Japan  that it made it, I mean, I owe it to my family, to my company, to myself.
I have no choice."
And he was like depressed.
He wanted to buy Caterpillar...
Well China is doing that times 100, times 1,000, and what theyre doing is the devaluation of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete.
We cant allow that stuff to happen.
Look, when we send stuff over to China, it doesnt get in.
If it does get in, you have to pay a big tax.
You know, its not supposed to be that way.
You know, its supposed to be free trade.
Its supposed to be they come we go, back and forth.
They devalued their currency and on top of it, they make it impossible.
I have a friend whos a great manufacturer.
He said its virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do.
He cant get his goods into China.
When he does get them in, theres a tax to pay.
I have a friend who actually bought an airplane and he cant get it into China because the tax is so massive.
Hes going to sell it now at a big loss.
Okay?
And think about Boeing.
Okay?
Think about Boeing.
Boeing is building a plant over here.
Boeing just had a big order from China.
But China is making them build a massive airline facility.
Right?
Massive.
Like bigger than anything youve seen.
Okay, you feel good about Boeing right now.
Tell me in five years.
Unless Im president.
Youll be fine.
Dont worry about it.
But tell me in five years youre going to feel good about Boeing because Ill tell you whats happening.
They are going to build that plant  theyre building it, its going to be finished soon  theyre going to build that plant, theyre going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden youll be reading a big front page story all over the place that Boeing is going to leave, right, South Carolina, theyre going to make all their planes in China.
Because this is what they do.
Thats what they do.
And our leaders arent smart enough to stop it, okay?
I have Carl Icahn endorse me.
Great businessman, very rich guy, very, very successful.
If I told Carl, Carl, watch over China trade, were going to be in great shape.
We have right now people that have no concept of what theyre doing.
They have no concept of what theyre doing.
Theyre political hacks.
Thats what they are.
Theyre political hacks and these are the people that are negotiating with these people China.
And again, China likewise, I get along great with China.
Largest bank in the world my tenant.
They buy condos for tens of millions of dollars.
I have the Bank of America building in California.
I own a big chunk of that.
I got that through China through a very complex set of transactions but through China.
I mean, I think China is terrific.
Im not angry at China.
Im angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with China.
Im not angry.
So were going to get things changed around.
Were going to use our best people.
Were going to be so smart, and were going to start winning again.
Were going to have strong borders.
Were going to have strong military.
Were going to take care of our vets.
Were going to have such great trade deals.
Were going to win again.
Were going to win again.
Were going to win so much.
And you know, and by the way, we are going to get rid of ISIS and were going to get rid of them fast.
I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning.
I was against the war in Iraq.
We shouldnt have done it.
We did it.
Then Obama got out the wrong way.
We shouldnt have done Iraq.
We did it.
It destabilized the Middle East.
Exactly.
If you go back, you could see 2003, 2004, I said its going to totally destabilize the Middle East because you had Iran and Iraq and they were the same militarily.
Theyd fight, fight, fight.
Boom.
Then theyd rest.
Then theyd fight, fight, fight for years and years and years.
We decapitated Iraq and now Iran is taking over.
Not only do they get the $150 billion.
Maybe the worst transaction Ive ever seen negotiated.
No, no, dont buy the famous Obama administration.
The worst, one of the dumbest deals Ive ever seen.
I mean, we get nothing.
We get nothing.
We should have gotten those hostages before we started even negotiating.
Not now.
We should have gotten them years ago.
But if you look at whats going on and now on top of that we gave them Iraq because Iran is now taking over Iraq.
Its just taking them over.
So heres what we did.
We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who we all love all over the place.
Theyre the best people.
Most incredible.
Theyre tougher than all of us these people.
I mean, what theyve gone through.
So the wounded warriors all over the place.
You know what we have?
We have nothing.
We have nothing.
We have absolutely nothing.
So heres what were going to do.
Were going to change things around.
Were going to be smart.
And we have  well do what we have to do in terms of ISIS and all.
But we have to start rebuilding our country.
We have $4 trillion in the various places.
$4 trillion.
Not going to happen anymore.
Were going to have a strong military.
But were going to have to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals.
I mean, our country is like a third world country.
You go over to Qatar, you go over to some of these places in the Middle East.
You go to China.
You see the airports.
You see the bridges.
They have bridges that are so incredible youve never seen anything like it.
They have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour and we have things that go chug, chug, chug, chug like from 100 years ago.
Weve become like a third world nation because were fighting everybody elses battles.
And remember this, we are like the policemen of the world but we dont get paid anything.
We protect Germany.
We protect Japan.
Do you know that in Japan if we get attacked, we have a treaty with Japan, if we get attacked they dont have to do anything.
If they get attacked, we have World War III, we have to protect them.
Okay?
I mean, who makes these deals?
We protect as an example South Korea, who have a maniac right next to them.
Right?
But we protect South Korea.
So every time we order televisions, they come from South Korea, they make a fortune.
We protect South Korea.
Let me tell you something.
Why arent they paying?
They pay peanuts for what we do.
Every time this guy, you know, raises his head, we see our ships start to sail, our soldiers get ready.
We have 28,000 soldiers at the border.
So we take care of the world.
We dont get it.
Saudi Arabia, before the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day.
$1 billion a day.
And we rent space there so we can help them.
We rent military bases.
We pay rent.
And yet without us they wouldnt last for two weeks.
Theyd be gone.
So were going to change all that stuff folks.
I mean, I want to be good.
We want to be fair.
We want to have heart.
And were not going to let these Syrian folks in that we dont know who they are.
We dont know where they come from.
Theyre not coming into this country.
Theyre not coming in.
I mean, there are a lot of them.
I dont know if you know it.
You have a lot of them moving into South Carolina.
I dont know.
Have you heard this?
And you ought to tell your governor dont let them move to South Carolina.
You dont want them in South Carolina.
And I know theyll say, "Well, we have nothing to do.
Were state government."
Let me tell you something.
If a governor from a state didnt want to have them, I dont care what it says, you dont have to have them...
We want to help them with safe zones.
We want to get the Gulf States to pay.
I dont want to pay.
We owe $19 trillion.
We owe enough.
We can lead it but let the Gulf States  they have so much money they dont know what to do with it.
Let them build safe zones.
Look at whats happening in Germany.
Its a mess.
Look at Sweden.
Look at Brussels.
I mean, Brussels, you go there 20 years ago, 15 years ago it was incredible.
So when I call for moratoriums and I call for this, first I get hit with tremendous heat.
Right?
Then everybody starts to say, "You know, hes right."
Same thing  on June 16th, I announced weve got to stop illegal immigration.
The heat I took was unbelievable.
Three, four weeks later theyre all saying, you know, Trump is right.
Then Kate killed in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, by an illegal immigrant.
You have Jamiel in Los Angeles killed.
Incredible guy.
Young man.
The fathers a friend of mine  a great guy.
You had the veteran  65-year-old woman  a veteran raped, sodomized, and killed in Los Angeles by an illegal immigrant.
Weve got to stop it folks.
Weve got to stop it.
Weve got to be smart.
Weve got to be a country again.
Weve got to be a country again.
So I just want to thank  this endorsement meant so much to me from these two guys and from the whole community.
I just want to say get out and vote.
Were going to do something youre going to be so happy with.
Were going to win so much and were going to make America great again.
Thats what we want to do.
Make America great again.
So Saturday, get out and vote.
Thank you!
We love you all.
Thank you very much!
Thank you.
Thank you very much folks.
I dont really think  look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally.
I was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13.
I ended up coming in second.
Didnt devote tremendous time to it.
Didnt devote tremendous money to it.
In fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, Im about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient.
I came in second.
I came into strong second.
Third, I think, was quite a bit away  I think 2,500 or something  close to 3,000 votes away.
Theres a big difference between second and third.
I think we did really well.
You know, as far as thats concerned.
I think the press  some of the press said I did fantastically well.
Some of the press doesnt want to give it credit.
I think we did very well.
I didnt expect to do so well.
I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said Im 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people.
But it had taken me back to June 16th.
I was told "Dont even go to Iowa.
Start right here in New Hampshire.
Just dont waste your  "
...Im going to Iowa.
I went.
I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals.
We did really fantastically and came very close to winning.
I mean, we came very close to winning.
We came in second place.
So I am very happy with what happened in Iowa.
You know, you had 17 people and I was second.
Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second.
And I think we did a very good job.
No, I dont think I feel any pressure.
I mean, were going to just do what I have to do.
And if it works out, thats great.
And if it doesnt, thats okay too because you know Im here to do one thing  the theme  make America great again.
Im going to do it.
And I think we did very well  I think we did really well in just about everything weve done running for office.
I think we have a very good result yesterday.
It could have been a little bit better.
It could have been one notch better.
But its interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list, theyre at 1%, 2%, you know, in terms of what happened  what just happened  theyre at 1%, theyre at 2%, theyre 3%.
Nobody ever talks about them.
And Im at 24% or 25%, and they say, "Oh, couldnt you have done better?"
You know, I think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time I spent and for the amount of money I spent.
Well, I think I have  I think it fits me better, probably suits me better.
Ive done very well in New Hampshire.
Ive been here a lot more.
I have very good relationships with the people of New Hampshire.
But Ive had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.
I really dont.
I really dont see that happening.
I dont know whats going to happen.
You dont  nobody does.
Well see what  youll have many, many people that arent doing very well.
I am doing very well.
But you have many, many people that are here, that are well-known politicians  theyre governors and theyre senators  but theyre not doing very well.
And they just came back from a, you know, very major defeat yesterday.
And mine wasnt.
...You know, its very interesting.
If you look at the numbers from yesterday, I got the highest number in history outside the one number  in the history of the primary.
...Also, I guess they had 185,000 people, which is 45,000 or 50,000 people more than they ever had.
No, I mean, I think well get a lot of Sanderss voters.
You know, theyre very much into the trade world and Im the best on trade.
He mentions it but I dont think hes going to be capable of doing anything about it.
No, I think were going to do really well here.
I look forward to it.
We have a lot of events scheduled, yes.
Well, we do.
We have one commitment long-term for Arkansas actually where were going to have about 10,000 people.
But were going to be back and forth very quickly.
Were going to have a lot of events scheduled, yes.
Well, I just think, you know, Im just happy with the way were doing.
You know, weve bonded with the people whether its there or here.
I mean, theres just a big bonding process going on.
If you look at South Carolina, its the same thing.
I mean, were doing really well there.
But weve devoted much more time here and South Carolina 






Its not a question of learning.
I mean, I just want to continue to do well...Our theme  the theme is so important.
Its just make America great again.
Thats what were going to do.
Thats what were going to do.
Not really a question of learning.
Well, if you look at the second place, people didnt talk about my second place.
They didnt talk about it as positively as they should have.
And yet, with Marco who was more than 2,000 votes behind me  thats a lot of votes by the way  they said, "Oh, hes surging.
Hes surging."
So, I dont know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run  Scott was mentioning before  "One of the amazing things about you, youve never run for office before.
Its incredible how you did."
My brands doing great.
Yeah.
No, I think just work.
Were going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings, a lot of talks, a lot of speeches.
Were going to be meeting with a lot of people and I think were going to do very well.
Well, well be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight, I think they have 4,000 or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people.
Same venue, same everything.
They had 200 people.
So we have  theres a good bonding going on.
Well, I enjoyed it.
I have unlimited, I have unlimited  you know, its funny.
When I look at the various people, they said so and so has $20 million.
I have unlimited.
Thats not the thing.
The only  you know, Im a businessperson.
I want to spend wisely.
And Im probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly I havent had to spend very much although I guess we just did a recent filing and I would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million.
But Im self-funding.
And I must tell you, I dont know that enough people appreciate it.
Im self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not.
So I wont be influenced by the lobbies and you know et cetera, et cetera.
But I dont know  I was talking to Scott about this before  I dont know its really appreciated by the voters.
Im the only one on both sides thats self funding.
Im putting up my own money.
And I dont know that the voters appreciate it.
When they go into vote, I dont think they say "Im going to vote for Trump because hes self-funding and hes not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera."
Im going to tell them and I tell them.
But sometimes they like it but I dont think its something they vote for, which is a shame because its actually a very big thing.
You understand that.
Its a very big thing.
Its a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisions...or looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent.
Thats a real positive...
I just dont know whether or not the voters appreciate it.
Ive learned that theyre great people.
I really, I thought the people in Iowa were fantastic...You know, obviously I was second.
I had the largest vote getting in the history of a Republican primary except for one and I brought many of those extra people in.
And they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of Republican primaries in terms of Iowa by far  not even close.
I think it was like 50,000 or 60,000 more than theyve ever had before.
So I just  I learned that they are terrific people in Iowa.
Yeah, I look forward to it.
...No, I dont think so.
I have a very good relationship with Marco.
I like him...
I dont see that necessarily.
Youre talking about Iowa?
Well, that could have been with the debate.
I think it could have been the debate.
I think some people were disappointed that I didnt go in the debate.
If I had to do it again, I would have done the exact same thing.
And the reason is  you know why?
Because I raised $6 million for the vets in one hour.
So if I took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $6 million, Ill do that all day long.
Well, were going to be spending money.
Were going to be spending money  were going to be spending a lot of money.
Well be spending money on ads and well be spending money on the ground game.
I cant help it, honey, whether Im celebrity.
I mean, this is me.
Look, I think most people say I did a great job in Iowa.
I came in second.
I spent far less than anybody else.
And had I known that I was going to be liked as much as I am in Iowa and people did like me  you will understand that  I would have maybe spent a little bit more and I would have been there a little bit more and maybe I would have won it.
But, you know, Im very happy with it.
I have 7 delegates right at the top.
You look at other people in all fairness  senators, governors  theyre, you know, theyre way down.
When I have 25% or 26% and they have 1% but you people dont mention that.
But the one thing is you people dont mention that.
You dont mention all the other names.
Now, you mention the person, Marco, good guy.
But he came in third.
And they make it sound like he had a victory and I didnt.
But I came in second.
...I started off on 17th.
I was 17th.
When I first started, I had nothing.
And then I inched my way up  went pretty rapidly actually.
And now Im leading everything and I did okay in Iowa.
Pretty good in Iowa.
Well, I think were going to have great success here.
I think its a much different kind of a process.
This isnt a caucusing process.
This is a much different  this is a normal voting process.
The Iowa is a much different kind of a thing.
Well, he [referring to Ted Cruz] insulted me.
I mean, he started with the insults, as you know.
And he insulted Ben Carson by doing what he did to Ben Carson.
That was a disgrace.
And he insulted the people of Iowa by doing a voter violation form that nobodys ever seen before which was disgraceful.
No, no, hes a man of insult.
No, Im going.
I have thousands of people going.
No, but we dont have that invite.
I like Mike Huckabee but no, I dont think hes even going to be there.
I did.
I did.
No, I like him.
Well, hes left the race so I feel pretty good about that.
Hes a good man.
Well, were adding some and were adding them pretty rapidly.
...People in your world are saying they possibly could.
So I dont really see one or two.
I see there could be a number.
Id love to finish first.
You know, again it would still not be horrible because youre competing against a lot of very talented people that have been politicians all their lives.
I have been a politician for 6 months.
No, but Id love to finish first.
Wouldnt horrible but you know it wouldnt be the worst thing in the world.
I could think of worse things.
But Id like to finish first.
I think we will finish first.
Id like to finish first.
...Just so you understand.
I am totally self-funding my campaign other than small donations because people send in small donations for $10, $15, $20...






No, no, thats merchandise sales.
Thats a lot of merchandise sales.
Its a small amount of money compared to what I put in.
Its very hard when somebody sends you a check for $17.50 and $9 and $200, very hard to send that back.
I am.
And I always make the reference.
I always make a reference to that and I do it every time.
Well, hes [referring to Scott Brown] somebody that I respect, always liked.
And hes very, very respected throughout the country but hes very respected here.
And everybody wanted his endorsement and Im very honored that hes giving it to me and hes going to give it to me on the stage.
That happens with endorsements.
No, that happens with endorsement.
Its pretty common with endorsements.
...A poll came out a few days before that said I was about 5 points so maybe there was a tinge.
And again, it may have been the debate, which would have set records if I did it.
So I would have liked that.
But the fact is it could have been the debate.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it isnt.
But I would have done it exactly the same way because I raised, Scott, we raised in one hour, I raised $6 million for the vets.
And I would never, ever give that up to go between first and second in Iowa.
Wouldnt be worth it.
I think her email situation is very serious.
I have a feeling shes being protected by the Democrats because it just looks to me to be more serious than anybody that Ive seen including Gen. Petraeus.
If you watch and study and read about various lawyers  you know, thats what they do  they really feel shes in grave danger and what shes done is against the law not just against rules.
Its against the law.
I just dont know whats going to happen because I dont know whether or not the Democrats are going to protect her.
I never saw a race where theyre flipping coins.
I mean, theyre flipping coins.
What kind of a race is that?
Its ridiculous.
I thought it was terrible.
I mean, you call it a tie.
But to flip coins, they say "Okay, youre going to get this district.
Were going to flip a coin."
I dont know.
I cant tell you yet.
I think hes [referring to Ted Cruz] certainly was dirty what he did to Ben Carson was terrible.
He did the voter violation form.
I thought that was terrible.
Actually, I thought it was terrible.
And when they said that Ben Carson was out of the race and come vote for him, I thought that was terrible.
Okay?
Thank you everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Wow, what a crowd.
Thank you very much everybody.
Such an honor.
With the snow coming down and its a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in.
But you know, we wont wait.
Well go ahead.
Right?
Well go ahead.
First of all, congratulations to the Iowa State basketball team.
You had a  what was that all about?
I turned on the game.
I said, "Wow, this shouldnt be that good of a game."
And at the end of the game, I said, "Who won?"
Yes?
That was great and its a great achievement.
I also want to pay my respects to Ben Carson.
They had a really bad accident.
Some of his staffers were hurt really bad.
So I just want to pay my respects to Ben.
Hes a good guy  a really good guy  and his staffers and hopefully they get better.
Say a prayer for them.
Okay?
Weve had an amazing time today.
Weve been all over Iowa and were going to be here tomorrow.
Were going to be here so much youre going to get so sick of me.
Youre going to say, "Please, tell him to get out of here.
Tell him to leave.
Tell him to go."
But weve had an incredible time.
And you know it started really  weve had really a pretty good week.
The debate last week  everybody watched the debate.
And who knew about these debates?
I didnt know anything about the debates.
And its been fun and its been interesting.
And Ive been treated semi-fairly by the moderators.
Not 100%.
Some have been very fair actually, and some have been not so fair.
And you know, a lot of the press hasnt been very fair.
Boy, look at the press back there.
They must think theres a big event going happen today.
Wow, thats a lot of them  its like the Academy Awards.
But weve had an amazing  its been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator.
We came down that escalator and it was  I said, "Lets go" to my wife, whos been so supportive and so wonderful.
I said, "Lets go.
Were going to make America great again.
Thats what were going to do."
And you know, its hard to do this because when you think of it Ive never done it before.
Ive never been a politician.
Thank goodness but Ive never been a politician.
Ive always done jobs and put a lot of people to work.
Tens of thousands of people over the years.
And you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me.
The Nevada poll just came out where Im leading with Hispanics, which I knew, I knew.
And we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said Im going to run for president I gave up a lot.
You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice.
Thats hard to do.
You have a top show and you say, "Im not doing it anymore.
Im sorry."
They wanted to do it so badly.
And Steve Burke, whos a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said "Come on, Donald.
Come on.
Do it.
Youre not going to run.
Do it.
Do it."
I said, "Steve, Im going to run."
I was pretty sure.
You know, that was about two months before.
I was pretty sure.
It really is a tough thing to do.
You know, all my life Ive heard "If youre a very successful person, youll never run for president.
Youll never really run for politics.
But youll never ever run for president."
And I built a great company and its a tremendous number.
You saw the filings.
The press was going to look so closely.
It was like D-Day when we put those papers in.
You know, first thing I did I announced.
They said, "Oh, hes actually going to do it" because most of them said "Hell never do it."
Then when I signed...thats when you sign your life away.
And I signed that.
They said, "Whoa!
He signed that.
Well, hell never file his financials because maybe hes not as rich as everybody thinks."
And I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable  you didnt hear a thing about it.
Oh boy, were they looking.
I mean, were they looking.
And almost 100 pages.
The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that.
And it showed a company thats a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow.
You know, the way its supposed to be.
And its great.
And the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States.
We need that kind of thinking.
We need that  whatever it is.
We need a mentality thats going to  you know, were at $19 trillion in debt.
Its going to be up to $21 trillion.
You saw that horrible budget.
Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and thats going to lift it.
And so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and Ill tell you right now.
You know, now that were at it.
And they came out some brand new ones  some beauties.
And ones coming out  I guess a big ones coming out.
I dont know exactly what it is but its got to be pretty good because I see the response.
I mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building.
Somebody said its a barn.
This is a very nice barn actually.
But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is.
And we do have something special in a couple of minutes.
To me, its really special because its a person that I think is a spectacular person.
So its very special to me.
But then the polls came out and some of them  as an example  national polls 38% for Trump, 20% for second.
I wouldnt even names.
Right?
I wont even mention names.
Im going to be non-confrontational today for a change.
21% for the second.
11%.
And then theyre all down.
Some of them are actually at 0% and 1%.
I dont know.
Jeb  well, you know, Jebs got one problem.
He loves Common Core, meaning he wants your kids educated from Washington, which is immediately no good.
And his second problem is hes very weak on illegal immigration.
Remember, he said they come as an act of love.
I said, "What?
They come as an act of love?"
So I think those are two very bad points frankly.
...So South Carolina just came out and thats 32% for Trump, 18% for second, 11% for third.
Great.
Florida leading by a lot  31%, 19%, 13%, and then all down in the dumps.
Georgia just came out.
I have 33%.
Yeah, dont forget thats 33%.
Hard to believe.
Thats with 14 people, 15 people.
I dont know when they took it but it was recent.
33%.
Connecticut  now, Tom Brady loves me and thats sort of like, you know, and I love Tom Brady by the way.
35% to 18% to 9% to 2%.
You know, to nothing.
Maryland just came out.
Maryland  great place  32% to 15% to 11% to 9% and then you know they sort of phase out.
You ever hear of a place called Iowa?
Oh, I love this.
Were doing actually great.
First of all, I have to tell you.
You know, they never report it.
Even CNN doesnt report it.
CNN does a poll, probably spent millions, they never report their poll.
The CNN poll was 33% for Trump, 20% for Chris.
Nobody talks about it.
Nobody talks about it.
They dont talk about it.
They talk about  CNN is reporting other peoples polls.
So, I call up.
I say, "Wait a minute.
Youre CNN.
You spent a fortune on polls and you dont report your own polls because Im winning by a lot."
And they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls.
But were doing well.
I think were doing a lot better than anyone knows.
Gravis just came out  34% for Trump, 28% for Cruz.
PPP 28% for Trump, 26% for Cruz.
In other words, its a little close here.
Quinnipiac poll  very respected 31% for Trump, 29% for Cruz.
And then again CNN 33% to 20%.
So were  I think were doing good.
I think were actually doing better than the polls.
Now, I could do this.
I could say, "Well, I just want to do well in Iowa."
I want to win Iowa, folks.
Because look, I love the people.
The evangelicals have been phenomenal.
Im doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide Im winning with evangelical  I dont know if you know that  by a lot nationwide.
With Iowa, Im doing really well with the evangelicals.
Were doing really well with the Tea Party.
Were doing well  I mean, you hear the numbers.
I mean, these are the numbers.
But I actually think were doing even better than the polls.
And you know, theres the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, "Are you going to vote for Trump?
Hes got very, very tough immigration policies.
He wants to destroy Obamacare and replace it with something a lot better."
Im going to do that.
Okay?
But you know, a lot of people, theyll pick up the phone and theyll hear different things and theyll say, "Uh, no Ill vote for  " and then theyd get in the booth and they say, "Trump is my man."
There are a lot of people saying that were going to do a lot better.
But well see because Feb. 1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out.
Youve got to do it.
Otherwise, weve all wasted our time.
You know, one of the groups in Maine and it was like incredible.
We were in different places up in New England recently and New Hampshire was amazing.
And the people are standing there.
It was so cold.
There was one little group of  despite global warming  you know, you hear about "It was so cold."
It was windchill below zero.
And people were standing outside for hours trying to get in.
And then you hear the announcers.
"Well, will they show up to vote?"
And I dont know much but I say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldnt believe in Tennessee, in Texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but theyll stand for hours and hours to get in.
Why arent they going to go and vote?
Or in your case caucus?
Why arent they going to go and vote?
Its sort of an amazing thing.
So we think theyre going to really be  why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote?
Now, yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different.
Its a very interesting system.
But it is different.
Heres what I have to say about Iowa.
Its very important.
So you know theres a movement to move Iowa to the back of the pack.
Okay?
You know that.
Youll still see me but you wont see other people.
Believe me.
Im loyal.
To a fault Im loyal.
But youre going to see.
I give you my word.
I win; theyre not touching Iowa.
This is an amazing tradition.
No, seriously.
This is an amazing tradition.
Theyre not moving Iowa back.
And theyre not moving New Hampshire either because theyre talking about Iowa, New Hampshire.
Theyre not touching New Hampshire.
So, were going to just keep it the way it is.
It really is.
Its an amazing.
First of all, youre amazing people.
But all over the country its a movement all over the country.
The people are incredible.
They want to make America great again.
Theyre going to do something thats special.
And you know we used to talk silent majority?
I say its the noisy majority because its actually a noisy majority.
Its not a silent majority.
But people are fed up.
So I started on June 16th and we did well.
Practically from the beginning we went up.
And if you remember, we started at nothing.
You know, we started at nothing because nobody believed I was going to [run].
Even when they  my wife said, "You know if you run, youre going to win."
I said, "What do you mean?"
She said, "People dont believe youre going to run."
At the polls.
I was getting these little polls.
I felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors; they get these little polls.
...Jeb again, right?
Boy, hes taking a lot of abuse.
You know?
I told him "You know what?
You should use the name Bush.
Whats wrong?
Use the name Bush.
I mean, maybe its not working but its better than Jeb right?"
You know, I really do.
Get rid of the exclamation point and just put Jeb Bush.
Its your name.
Dont be ashamed of your name.
So anyways, I wish him the best.
But, you know, I started and I started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%.
And each time the pundits  these real geniuses back here  some of them are sitting back here  these real geniuses like George Will with the little glasses  take away the glasses.
He looks like a dumb guy, Im telling you.
But each time these geniuses would say, "Well, hes reached his plateau.
Hes plateaued" at 6%, right?
Then it goes to 11%.
"Well, you know, this is surprising but hes reached his plateau."
And then it goes to 18%.
And then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%.
Then it went actually 42% in the Gravis poll and in Reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that.
And then all of a sudden you didnt hear so much about the plateau.
I want to plateau at 42%.
You know, 42% with like 14 people thats pretty good.
But they kept saying, "Hes plateaued.
Thats all hell get.
Hes got these followers."
We have the smartest followers there are.
Number one, we have the smartest.
And the hardest working followers.
We have people that love the country more than anybody and they want to take back whats happened because our country is going to hell.
We can be nice about it.
We can say it nice and soft.
Our country is going to hell.
When you look at this crazy Iran deal where were paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they dont know where the fifth is and you understand what that means.
Thats not a good sign.
But they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the Interpol.
These are bad dudes.
They get 14 plus seven so theyre getting 21 people.
And they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint.
Right to do oil.
Right to do whatever they want.
But what do they also get out of that deal?
First of all, theyre going to get nuclear.
They dont have to develop nuclear missiles.
They can buy them.
For the kind of money we gave them, theyre going to buy them.
Why are they going to develop?
Remember the deal?
24 days.
They have 24 days for inspection period.
They also have self-inspection.
Right?
But we paid $150 billion.
And I always say, "Wow.
What a great  the Persians are great negotiators."
I say what a great deal that is.
...Two weeks ago I started.
I said, "Wait a minute.
Thats not a good deal compared to the other deal."
They took over Iraq.
We gave them Iraq.
We knocked the hell out of Iraq.
We decimated their armed forces.
And you know, for years, they would fight.
For many, many years, for decades theyd fight, fight, fight.
Nobody would win.
Fight.
Theyd rest.
Then theyd go back to fight.
And now, we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world, which is Iraq.
We gave it to them.
Now, theyre going into Yemen.
And if you look at Yemen, take a look.
Theyre going to get Syria.
Theyre going to get Yemen.
Unless, you know, trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if I get in.
But lets just sort of leave it the way it is.
They get Syria.
They get Yemen.
Now, they didnt want Yemen.
But did you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia?
They want Saudi Arabia.
So, what are they going to have?
Theyre going to have Iraq.
Theyre going to have Iran.
Theyre going to have Iraq.
Theyre going to have Yemen.
Theyre going to have Syria.
Theyre going to have everything.
Theyre going to be a monster.
Weve created this.
We have stupid leadership.
Really stupid leadership.
So when I started, I said we have to do something about it.
Its not something I wanted to do.
Its something we have to do.
Because Im representing you.
Im not taking any money.
Im not, you know, like some of these guys where theyre getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know and theyre nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country.
They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries theyre representing.
And these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as theyre told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors.
Me, Im going to do the right thing.
And I always tell the story.
When Ford moves to Mexico, Im going to talk them out of it.
When Nabisco moves its plant from Chicago to Mexico, Im going to talk them out of it.
Believe me.
Its going to be easy.
Its going to be easy.
So, I started and I talked about the border.
Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration.
Took a lot of heat.
But you wouldnt even be talking about that subject if I didnt bring it up.
And I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about.
But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed.
And by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way.
Were going to protect the Second Amendment.
Were going to protect the guns.
Were going to protect your guns.
You know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married.
She came on a fiancee permit...You know, wonderful fiancee.
She was totally radicalized.
Maybe radicalized him.
Maybe he was already that way.
But weve got to start thinking.
We have to start using our head.
Bad stuff is happening.
We have to find out whats going on.
We have a president who wont even talk about the term.
If you think, he wont even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on.
And you cant solve the problem if you dont talk about it.
You have to talk about it.
So, very, very strongly we started talking about that.
And then after Paris  and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world.
You cant have a gun unless youre bad guy, you bought a gun.
And they walked in just said "Boom!
Boom!
Boom!
You, move over.
Boom!"
Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded.
But if we had a couple of  few of the people that I pointed out  I could plenty in this audience, believe me.
But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks.
Itd be a whole different story.
So very, very big on the Second Amendment.
But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more.
I went up 11 points.
I dont want to do it for that reason.
But it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great.
I love John Wayne.
From Iowa.
But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, whos an incredible woman, and she said, "Wed like to endorse you."
John Wayne was a strong guy.
We need strength.
We need strength in this country because were withering away with political correctness nonsense.
Okay?
Nonsense.
I mean, if you think of it, you cant say "Merry Christmas" anymore.
Were going to say "Merry Christmas" again.
You go into these department stores.
They dont have any Christmas displays.
They dont have the sign "Merry Christmas".
Even people that arent Christian are saying "Merry Christmas.
We love Christmas.
Let us say Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays."
But people like to see it.
And stores dont put it up anymore.
Were withering away.
Were going in the wrong direction.
So I said were going to do this and I had no idea it was going to work this way.
I figured Id be in the pack and maybe like a race horse.
You know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out.
I had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally.
Were up by so much.
And you know, I want to keep it that way.
I want to keep it that way.
When you think  and just one thing before I introduce our incredible person, our incredible guest.
But one thing  Ive spent to this point almost nothing and Im in first place by a lot.
I tell this story.
Im not bragging about spending.
Im just saying Im telling the story.
I have spent  theyll tell you  almost nothing and Im in first place by some polls have me 21 points.
Thats a lot.
Okay?
You know some people have 2%.
I have a lead of 20%.
But Im in first place by a lot.
Jeb has spent now $77 million.
Think of it.
And you know the reason I bring him up  I wouldnt even bring him up  but he spends a fortune on ads against me.
You people have all seen it before
I got along with everybody.
I contributed to everybody.
I was a world class businessman.
Now Im a politician, which Id hate to tell you.
But you go with everybody.
You want to love everybody.
You want them all to love you unless youre stupid.
But you want everybody to love you.
Everybody knows this story.
But so much money has been spent on me.
But he spent $79 million.
I spend nothing.
Im in first by a lot.
Hes down towards the bottom of the pack.
And I said to myself, "Its amazing.
Wouldnt that be great if this were the country doing this?"
As an example, education.
Were number 28 in the world.
We have third world countries that are ahead of us.
Education is very important to me.
World, I mean, countries that you wouldnt believe are ahead of us.
You wouldnt believe if you heard the names of some of these countries.
So were 28.
But were number one in spending per pupil by far.
Wouldnt it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education?
You know?
So Sweden and Norway and China and others are the best.
Were nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per pupil.
So were going to change that and I told you were going to get it localized but were going to change that.
Watch, you just watch...
I will tell you this: You cant educate your children through bureaucrats in Washington.
And thats what happens with Common Core.
When the parents take over and I really mean this because Ive seen it.
When the parents surround those schools and they love those kids and they love those pupils and even when their kids graduate, they are committed to those schools, theyre committed to education.
You can do so much better in Iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in Washington.
And not all of them but most of them are just interested in "Wheres my check?
How much do I get?
Lets make the process complicated."
And some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage.
Okay?
So were going to bring that back locally and its going to be great.
So what happened essentially is I started looking and all of a sudden things changed.
And people are now looking.
They know Ill do great with China.
Im going to do great with Japan.
Im going to do great with Mexico, whos killing us in trade and killing us also at the border.
We will build a wall and you know whos going to pay for the wall  Mexico.
Theyre going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things.
But now, were really focused on security and Im honored because I will tell you that all of polls and the CNN polls where said in particular that Trump is just not by a little bit but by many, many percentage points winning on ISIS, winning on the military, winning with the vets.
Were going to take care of our vets big league, by the way.
Big league.
Big league.
And were going to really take care of our military.
Its going to be big and strong and powerful and nobodys going to mess with us and its the cheapest thing we can do, Ill tell you that right now.
So its been a real focus.
I just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person.
This is a person who Ive known for a long time, who Ive respected for so long.
An incredible husband.
An incredible family.
And somebody that when I heard that she was going to endorse me, I was so honored.
You have no idea how honored.
And I would like to bring up if I might Gov.
Sarah Palin.
Special, special person.
Thank you.
SPEECH 9
 
(AUDIENCE MEMBERS SHOUTING)


  let me just tell you  let me just tell you a little secret.
Its the cheapest thing we can do.
Were never going to have to use it.
I dont think were going to have to use it.
Dont forget they talk about my tone.
I remember when Jeb and Hillary the same day  Mr. Trumps tone is not nice.
Theyre chopping off Christians heads in Syria and other places and they want me to have a nice tone.
Im supposed to be, oh, isnt life wonderful, OK?
Look, weve got to be tough, weve got to be smart, weve got to have heart too.
Weve got to have heart, weve got to take care of people.
Weve got to fix our health care program.
This Obamacare is a disaster.
You people know.
You people know.
Obamacare is a total catastrophe.
Its going to be repealed and replaced.
It will die in 17 anyway.
I dont know if you heard whats happening.
But its so bad, all the people that they didnt think were signing up are signing up.
And the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up.
And your rates are going up 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent.
Your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, youre never going to be able to use your deductible.
Youre never going to be able to use it.
So Obamacare is a disaster.
We are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it.
There are so many great things we can do on health care.
So many good things.
SPEECH 10


Wow.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
We start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor.
We dont want that stuff.
We dont want World Trade Centers.
We dont want that ever happen to us again.
Its not going to happen to us again.
So I want to thank everybody for being here.
Its a great honor.
They have thousands of people outside and sometimes theyll say "Would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in?"
But we cant get them in anyways so what difference there.
We all got lucky.
Were together tonight.
Thank you.
So we have a lot of big news today.
To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa  great, great state  and in Iowa, Trump 33%.
Beating everybody by a lot.
You have Cruz at 20% and Carson at 16% and going down and Rubio at 11% and Bush at 4%.
But its Trump at 33%.
It just came out.
Its Iowa  we love Iowa.
By the way, great ship named after Iowa too.
Ive been on that one too.
A really great one.
The other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll.
Trump 36% and then I wont even mention the other numbers because theyre so low.
You know, when you have so many people running  we had 17 and then they started to drop.
Ding.
Bing.
I love it.
I love it.
And youll be losing a lot over the next little while.
I would imagine.
I dont know.
When somebodys down at zero I would think that eventually theyll drop out.
The only difference is theres nothing to pick up if there is zero.
What do you pick up?
So anyways youll be seeing that.
One of the things I think thats so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy  so important  Trump 55%.
Everyone else nothing.
On the budget  Im really good at these things  economy, budgets.
I sort of expected this.
On the budget, Trump  this is with 15 people remaining  Trump 51%.
Everyone else bing.
Oh, heres one that I started and I took a lot of heat.
I took a lot of heat.
Sort of like the one were talking about today.
I guess youve heard a little bit about it.
But Ive taken a lot of heat on this one.
Illegal immigration.
Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me.
You know, all of my life, Ive heard that if youre a successful person, especially if you have very success  youve done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you cant run for president.
And yet, thats the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs.
Were being run by people that dont know what theyre doing.
Very sad.
On illegal immigration, Trump 48%.
Thats with 15 people.
Everyone else, no good.
On a thing called ISISoh, dont worry.
Well have plenty  well talk a lot about ISIS.
Can you believe it?
Here we have generals.
They go on television and talk.
They do all talk.
You people  a lot of military people here.
Whos military here?
All right, I love you.
By the way, speaking of it, were going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobodys ever going to mess with us again.
Nobody.
Theyre never going to mess with us.
You know in many ways, its the cheapest thing we can do.
The cheapest thing.
Instead of fighting these wars that we dont know what were doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, were going to make it so great, so strong that people  gosh, theyre not messing.
Theyre not messing.
And were going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors.
Were going to take care of them.
Because they  thank you, they are not being taken care of.
We have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and its not going to happen any longer.
Not going to happen.
Not going to happen.
So with ISIS  Trump 46%.
Can you imagine that?
With all of these characters running.
On foreign policy, Trump way up.
And you know, in theory you could say "Well, maybe its not my thing."
But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected.
And thats it.
I watched last night and I watched the president truly that didnt know what he was doing.
He didnt know why he was there.
He refuses to use the term "radical Islamic terrorism".
He refuses to use the term.
I dont even know if he knows what the hell is going on.
I really dont.
And then were looking at Hillary Clinton.
Honestly, I know Hillary.
Its just going to be an extension of Obama.
I think maybe worse.
Shes got no strength.
Shes got no stamina.
Remember that.
You dont need a president with no strength or stamina when were being ripped off on trade, were being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good.
When our soldiers arent being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today.
One of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that were the least prepared now than anytime that hes ever seen it and hes been there a long time retiring.
Thats how we are.
In the most dangerous world weve ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that dont know  they dont  Im telling you.
I watch them.
I watch these generals being interviewed.
Do you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed?
Theyd be interviewed after total and complete victory.
Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
Theyre not big for interviews.
You know, they shoot first, they talk later.
These guys  and I dont think well have to.
You know, just so you understand, Bush  Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me.
He was saying the nicest things about me.
Of course, he says hell be elected.
Hes at what 3%?
Right?
No, but he said some things and I was like  I said "Who says that about an opponent?
You dont say those things."
Youll find out what he said.
But he said very nice things.
But, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone  the tone  of Donald Trump is not nice.
And I say it all the time.
We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because theyre Christian and for other reasons.
Theyre being dumped and drowned in steel cages.
And we talk about my tone.
Hillary said the same thing.
"Mr. Trumps tone is not nice."
These people are living in a different planet.
Different planet.
And remember what I said about Hillary.
We need somebody whos strong.
We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things.
You know, I know a lot of tough people but theyre not smart.
Thats no good.
Theyre easy.
We need tough.
We need smart.
We need like every character.
We are so far behind the eight ball in this country.
We owe $19 trillion.
The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion.
Its a  think of it.
Trillion.
Trillion.
Trillion dollars.
Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago?
There was no such word.
We owe $21 trillion in the very near future.
Were really in trouble.
We have to rebuild our country.
We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
We have to rebuild our military.
And yet, we do deals with China where theres a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question.
Japan  they send their cars by the millions.
$70 billion a year imbalance.
Thats like a loss.
You look at Mexico.
Were going to build a wall.
It will be a real wall.
It will be a real wall.
Gonna happen.
Its gonna happen.
The people Im dealing with  and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people.
You know, theres 15 of us.
I had Perry came at me strong; he went down.
I had Gov.
Walker, nice guy, he went down.
Every guy that attacks me so far theyve all gone down.
Weve got to keep it that way, right?
I mean, Lindsey Graham.
Hes at zero.
Hes at zero.
Zero.
Let me ask you a question.
I dont get Lindsey Graham.
I dont get himHes literally at zero.
You see him.
And he keeps talking.
He gets so much television.
I mean, hes on television all the time and he doesnt go up.
Hes at zero, folks.
His ideas are so bad.
Im more militaristic than him.
But I know how to win; he doesnt.
He just wants to attack everything.
He doesnt know where the hell  ra ha.
And he always sits with John McCain.
Its like theyre the Bobbsey twins.
Theyre always sitting together.
No, its true.
Do you ever notice?
Sometimes I want to see him by himself.
Hes always sitting with John McCain, whos fine.
Im not knocking it.
But you got to know what to do.
Now me, I was against the war in Iraq.
So everyone says, you have the right temperament  I have a great temperament.
But youve got to attack.
If youve got to do something, youve got to know what youre doing.
I said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because youre going to ruin the balance.
It was so simple to me.
And actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump.
I said, "Fellas, youre going to have Iran take over the Middle East and thats whats happening."
And Irans going to take over Iraq as sure as youre sitting there.
And by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world.
We lost of thousands of lives.
We have wounded warriors all over the place.
$2 trillion.
We have nothing.
We got nothing.
We have absolutely nothing.
And we left.
And we have a president  we shouldnt have been there but then we shouldnt have left the way we left.
You know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans  wouldnt it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again?
Is that what we want to do?
Ill bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that were all in this together, folks.
We want to have a strong country.
Right?
But you know, if you think about it and youll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what.
Theyre just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera.
But most people arent and they believe something.
And I have some very smart friends dont agree with me; they agree with the other side.
But I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if were not vigilant  [interrupted by protester]  that was the same person.
Ive got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, Ill tell you that.
That was the same person.
You can do very nice but why dont you get her out because honestly its inappropriate.
So security, strengthen yourself up.
See, our country has this kind of security.
Thats the problem we haveTreat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out.
Same person.
One person.
Its one person.
They let her out.
They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens.
But you would think that everybody were all on the same basket that everybody every single person  [interrupted by protester]
So you would think that if we could get together, wed all be in the same boat.
Now, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate.
In fact, I tweeted "Is that all there is?"
about the presidents speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I dont care.
I dont care.
You know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment.
The mother saw them.
The mother didnt notice anything wrong.
I watched the sister being interviewed.
Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy.
I watched that interview.
"Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy.
I didnt know, I didnt know, I didnt know."
And I watched the next door neighbor saying, "Oh, well we didnt report them because we didnt want to racially profile or we didnt want to profile."
Give me a break.
Give me a break.
Were like the stupid country in so many different ways.
Its so  can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap thats happening with us?
They didnt want to report them because they thought it was profiling.
Okay, they saw bombs.
They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasnt to build a bathroom.
When a bomb is this long, cant put too many of them together for a bathroom, right?
And we thought they maybe but we didnt want to racially profile.
Oh, okay, youre okay, youre innocent.
Or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center  the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians.
At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they werebut while it was an attack, at least it was military.
But this was an attack on the World Trade Center.
So, whats happened is were out of control.
We have no idea whos coming into our country.
We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us.
We have no idea if they want to bomb us.
We have no idea whats going on.
And then I looked at poll numbers and I dont mean polls where Im winning; those numbers I like looking at.
These numbers I hated to look at.
And its very, very sad.
Ill go after some of the numbers.
25% of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy  very highly respected group of people who I know actually.
This is people living in this country.
25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims.
25%.
51% of the Muslims living in this country  by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; theyre great people.
But they know we have a problem.
They know we have a real problem.
Because somethings going on, and we cant put up with it, folks.
We cant put up with it.
51%  51% highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia.
You know what Sharia is.
So I wrote this out.
The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution.
The mainstream media  these people back here.
Theyre the worst.
They are so dishonest.
No, no, theyre so dishonest.
They are so dishonest.
I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people.
It was a love fest.
It went on for a long time.
Everybody stayed right tis the end.
I had one of the politicians  Kasich  who is just getting  hes a horrible debaterHe made a statement that "Oh, they left after 10 minutes."
Now, the press was there.
They saw it.
Nobody said it was a lie.
It was a total lie.
In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning.
Nobodys leaving.
Nobodys leaving here except for the one person that was screaming.
So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didnt want to do that because its not their thing to do.
You know, we get the biggest crowds.
They dont want to show this crowd tonight.
Theyre not going to show all the people outside trying to get in.
They dont do that.
They have the cameras right in my face.
I say fan the crowd just to show  look at all the people over here.
Its a record in the history of this ship.
But they dont show it.
They dont show it.
No, no.
And I say fan it and they never ever fan it.
I say fan the crowd and they never fan it.
And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her.
I guarantee.
Its disgusting.
Disgusting.
And by the way, some of the medias terrific but most of it 70%, 75% is absolute dishonest, absolute scum.
Remember that.
Scum.
Scum.
Theyre totally dishonest people.
I had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said "Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early."
I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes.
I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false.
Amazingly, theres a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC.
Shes back there.
Little Katie.
Shes back there.
What a lie it was.
No, what a lie  Katie Tur  what a lie it was from NBC to have written that.
It was a total lie.
And they did a story where they  I didnt know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media.
And they said it was a total lie.
And I loved it.
I loved it.
I loved it.
And then other people pick it up.
You know its NBC so somebody picks it up.
Third rate reporter.
Remember that.
Third rate.
Third rate.
So I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights.
And I dont want that.
I want ISIS to surrender.
Okay?
I want ISIS to surrender.
Very simple.
Its very simple.
So heres what happened.
Its been a little controversial.
Its been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof.
I like that.
But I have moreI wish we could call  is there any way we could call the election tomorrow?
Wouldnt you love that?
Now theyre coming at us in full force.
Theyre coming  not coming at me.
Theyre coming at all of us.
Theyre coming at all of us.
Because you know, we have a noisy majority.
They used to call it the quiet majority.
People are fed up.
Theyre fed up with incompetence.
Theyre fed up with stupid leaders.
Theyre fed up with stupid people.
They are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who  think of it.
They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group.
Six people were killed looking for him.
Okay?
Six people were killed.
Young.
Unbelievable.
I watched the parents on television.
Ive seen the parents.
But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same.
They left to try to bring them back.
He left.
He deserted.
You know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone.
It was called desertion.
Now I heard the other day they wont even do anything to him.
Can you believe it?
They think hes going to get away with nothing.
Hes going to have nothing.
So he left.
Oh, they treated him pretty rough though.
He got in there, he said, "I shouldnt have done this.
This isnt working out the way I thought."
Anyways, so we get him back and heres the deal we made.
We get a dirty, no good traitor.
Six people killedThey get five of their greatest killers that theyve been after  after  think of it for six years.
In fact, I hear nine years.
So they get these  right now have gone  theyre out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, Id hate to tell you.
So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that theyve wanted for many years.
Thats the way we do it.
The Iran deal.
We gave them $150 billion.
Its called amateur night.
We gave them $150 billion.
24 days  24 days  we think theres something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but its much longer than that because theres a whole process before the clock starts ticking.
So it could be forever.
But the best is where they have the right to self-inspect.
"Are you doing nuclear weapons over there?"
"Oh, well inspect tomorrow."
"Oh no, were not doing nuclear weapons."
You know, the Persians are great negotiators.
Always have been.
And somebody would say thats profiling.
Trust me, theyre great negotiators.
And Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator.
Horrible.
Hes a horrible negotiator.
These people are horrible.
I always Obama would be a unifier.
I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said "You know what?
I dont think hes going to be a good president."
I backed McCain; he lost by the way.
And you know, I dont blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one.
But I backed McCain; he lost.
I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost.
And I said, "This time Im going to do it myself.
Were not going to lose."
Were not going to lose.
Were not losing.
And the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one.
I love that.
Thats so important.
So, we put out a statement today.
We watched this.
And its impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night.
And we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy
Shall I read you the statement?
Donald J. Trump is calling for  now, youve got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and its common sense and we have to do it.
Remember the poll numbers.
25%, 51%.
Remember the poll numbers.
So remember this.
So listen.
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
We have no choice.
We have no choice.
We have no choice.
According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.
Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans  these are people that are here by the way, people that are here  25% not 1%.
By the way, 1% would be unacceptable.
1% is unacceptable.
25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part  think of that  as part of the global jihad.
They want to change your religion.
I dont think so.
I dont think so.
I dont think so.
Not going to happen.
As part of the global jihad.
And 51% of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia.
You know what Sharia is.
51%.
Sharia authorizes  now look, this is, I mean, its terrible.
Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who wont convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women.
I mean, you look  especially women.
Tough stuff.
And we have a president that wont even mention the term and youre talking about numbers like this.
Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, its obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension
Where the hatred comes from and why, well have to determine.
Well have to figure it out.
We have to figure it out.
We cant live like this.
Its going to get worse and worse.
Youre going to have more World Trade Centers.
Its going to get worse and worse folks.
We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but its going to get worse and worse.
Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad.
These are people only believe in jihad.
They dont want our system.
They dont want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.
They have no respect for human life.
So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldnt have had the carnage that you had in Paris.
You wouldnt had that carnage.
If they had guns, you wouldnt had that carnage.
So important the Second Amendment.
We have to preserve it and cherish it.
And we cant let these weak leaders diminish it.
If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice.
"Come over here.
Boom!
Come over here.
Boom!"
People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying.
Theyre sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die.
Now, the same thing a few days ago in California.
No guns.
We didnt have guns.
The bad guys had the guns.
And these young people  and I tell the press youve got to stop calling them "masterminds"  these are dirty, rotten scums.
These arent masterminds.
Remember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat?
Remember the guy in Paris  the "mastermind".
I was watching all the networks.
I wont mention who but some of them disgusted me.
"The mastermind is on the loose."
And we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids  they go over there.
Theyre young.
Theyre impressionable.
They go over there and they want to join ISIS.
And we have our anchors  I think I got them mostly stopped.
Did you notice that?
I dont hear it too much.
But they say "the young mastermind".
Oh, hes brilliant.
Young man, hes brilliant.
I dont even hes got a high IQIn Paris, I call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat.
Okay?
Not a smart guy.
A dummy.
Puts people in there  mastermind  bing, bing, bing, its like shooting everybody.
Youve got to be a mastermind.
So the press has to be responsible.
Theyre not being responsible because were losing a lot of people because of the Internet.
And we have to do something.
We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand whats happening.
We have to talk to them.
Maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way.
Somebody will "Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech".
These are foolish people.
We have a lot of foolish people.
We have a lot of foolish people.
Weve got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands.
Theyre leaving our country.
And then when they come back, we take them back.
"Oh, come on back.
Where were you?"
"I was fighting for ISIS."
"Oh, come on back.
Go home.
Enjoy yourself."
When they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back.
They never can come back.
They never can come back.
They can never, ever, ever come back.
Its over.
How about that?
And now that theyve become radicalized, theyre totally radicalized.
And how about the woman?
She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia.
She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy.
Probably a guy who couldnt get women.
I dont know what the hell his problem is.
Its probably the first women hes ever had.
I dont know what was going on.
But he became radicalized quickly.
Notice how easy it is?
He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree.
Folks, those days are over.
Those days are over.
We have to be tough.
We have to be smart.
We have to be vigilant.
Yes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques.
But yes, we have to look at mosques.
We have no choice.
We have to see whats happening because something is happening in there.
Man, theres anger.
Theres anger.
And we have to know about it.
We cant be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things.
We cant be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didnt want to tell anybody.
We cant be that.
We have to be strong.
When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly.
Dont worry about profiling.
I promise I will defend you from profiling.
I promise.
So when I started this whole quest  I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this?
Its been an amazing thing.
No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed.
We went to Dallas  20,000 people in Dallas.
25,000 people.
Mobile, Alabama  35,000 people.
Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go  Florida  we have crowds that are maxed.
The only problem we have is the size of the room  thousands of people outside trying to get in.
Usually I do a double.
I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldnt say I exactly love doing after the first one.
But there is an unbelievable love in these rooms  all the same.
I love you too.
I love youThank you.
Thank you.
I love you too.
Theres an unbelievable love in all of these places  Oklahoma  20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice.
Theres an unbelievable love.
And theres an unbelievable love of the country.
We want to see good things.
We dont want to be bad people.
We dont want to be tough and nasty.
We believe in the Constitution more than anybody.
But we cant let people use and abuse our rights.
We cant let people kill us.
They want to kill us.
They want to destroy us.
We cant let it happen.
We just cant let it happen.
And I have a friend whos a very, very successful man, and I went to one event  he came with me.
We had 24,000 people.
And this guys a real tough cookie.
Hes a great financial guy.
One of the guys Id definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China.
Believe me, youre going to be in good shape when that happens.
We wont have these characters.
You know, this whole thing with all of these guys.
By the way, Im the only one thats self-funding my campaign.
Everyone else is controlled.
Only one.
Im the only one.
Only one.
Im self-funding my campaign.
And these other guys.
You know, theyre getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know.
I have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money.
I said, "Honestly, I cant take it.
I dont want to do."
I cant take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money  my whole life Ive been taking money.
Now Im sort of like what am I doing?
But came in and I said, "So what are you going to do?
I dont want your money."
And he said, "I got to go someplace else."
Theyre like gamblers.
Theyre like gamblers.
But I said, "You like me best."
"I like you best but Im going to go someplace else."
Because they want to be part  they want to 
Let me tell you, who is more than me?
I gave millions to these guys.
Nobody knows the system better than me.
I knew it from the other side.
Dont forget, I was the fair-haired boy.
I was like the establishment.
Theyd all come to me, and Id give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max  bing, bing, bing.
I used to say "Senators, dont come to my office.
Anybody thats a U.S.
Senator that calls me, well send you a campaign contribution."
But you know what?
Ill tell you something.
In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS  theyre corrupt  they totally control Bush and Rubio and I wont say Cruz because hes been very nice to me.
Nah, hes been nice.
Hes got to hit me first.
Once he hits me, I promise you.
I promise you.
No, Ive been nice to Christie but he really hit me today.
Chris Christie.
I mean, I dont know.
Hes a friend of mine but hes not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today.
He hated this and yet he said anybody could come.
Youve got to look at some of the statements from the past.
But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out whats going on.
Does that make sense by the way?
Until we find out.
And he talked about  thats inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right?
But thats the statement of an inexperienced manAbout we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in.
Does that sound like inexperienced?
So Chris, whos a friend of mine, he hit me hard.
And I said I got to hit him at least once.
So I wont do this a lot.
Look, heres the story.
The George Washington Bridge.
He knew about it.
Hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, theyre closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour.
People couldnt get across for 6, 7 hours.
Ambulances, fire trucks.
Theyre with him all the time  the people that did it.
They never said, "Hey boss, were closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight."
No, they never said that.
Theyre talking about the weather, right?
He knew about it.
He knew about it.
Totally knew about it.
Hes a got a very friendly group of people over there that they dont think so.
But I dont know.
Its called life.
Youve got to be smart in life.
I would say theres less than 1% chance.
It could be but I doubt it.
He knew about it.
They didnt mention at one of their meetings?
I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day.
Theyd just say, "Chris, tonight were closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you."
"Oh, okay."
They didnt mention?
Nobody believes that.
Number two.
Nine downgrades of the state.
Nine downgrades.
Its a disaster.
I have property over there  the taxes are through  Ill use an expression  coming out of my ears, okay?
Tremendous taxes over there.
You had nine downgrades.
You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood.
I actually called.
I said, "Let me ask you.
Is he going to vote for Obama?"
I thought he was going to vote for Obama.
I dont know.
I think he possibly did.
And Romney I was very disappointed.
One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election.
If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again.
I would have never done it.
So when Chris talks about  when he talks about lack of experience  I built this incredible company.
I filed papers where everyone said "Wow, that is unbelievable."
I would have probably filed them even when I didnt run because I built a great, great company.
Tremendous cash.
Tremendous assets.
Tremendous net worth.
Very little debt.
Unbelievable cash flow.
And I filed.
Everybody said "Number one, he wont run."
And I ran.
I took a deep breath and I said, "Lets go" to my wife and we came down that escalator.
Right, the famous escalators.
Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay?
But then they said, "Oh, well he announced."
So these talking heads  most of whom are not even smart people, believe me.
Then theyd say well, they went to Ivy League college.
So did I go to Ivy League college.
They went to this.
Most of them didnt go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say theyre brilliant.
Ones brilliant because he wears glasses, you know?
Like Perry.
Remember Perry?
We dont like him.
But what happens is they say "Well, hell never file form A."
Thats basically where you sign your life away.
I filed form A.
Then they said, "Well, hell never sign his financial statement because maybe hes not as rich as everybody thinks."
Then they said, "And if he does, hell ask for many, many delays because youre entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever.
And theyll delay it until after the election."
I said, "No" so I filed it ahead of schedule.
And what happened?
Remember?
They went down.
They couldnt believe it.
It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned.
I built a great company and the reason  honestly worth billions and billions of dollars.
Remember that  low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets  Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Ave., land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over.
In North Carolina, I have a great piece of property.
Trump National Golf Club.
Some of you know it.
Great, right at the best location.
And what happens?
What happens?
So I filed and everyone said "Oh, I cant believe it."
Then they said "Well, maybe he wont do so well with the polls."
And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run.
They never thought I was going to run.
And I told the story the other night for really the first real time.
But my wife said to me "You know if you run you will win.
Dont you?"
Shes very smart.
I said, "What do you mean?"
She said, "If you dont run, youre never going to poll before.
Nobody believes youre going to run."
So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they werent great before I announced.
She said, "No, the only way youre going to get a poll number is youve got to announce."
Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say youre running, it doesnt matter.
Nobody believes youre running.
So I said, "All right."
Im getting these lousy early numbers and Im saying, "I dont know.
I dont want to run and find out it doesnt work."
I dont want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing.
Its true.
Its true.
So I said, "All right.
Lets take it."
So we go down on the escalator.
You know what I did?
You remember I took a deep breath because Im telling you and you know what Im talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards.
There were so many cameras.
I have never seen anything like it.
The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press.
And I just said, "Lets go" to my wife.
I took a deep breath and I went down and I talked about lots of things, including illegal immigration.
And illegal immigration was such a big subject.
And Im telling you had I not brought it up, it has turned out to be  and I took heat.
I took heat like nobody has ever taken heat.
Rush Limbaugh said "The most incredible incoming that Ive ever seen a human being endure".
And then he doubled down a week later because I was right.
And now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things.
And then you had the killing of Kate [Steinle] and the killing of Jamiel and the killing recently in California of a 66-year-old  think of it, 66-year-old  veteran, female, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant.
And many, many more.
Its a huge problem.
And they take our jobs and a lot of other things.
So all of a sudden, everyones saying "Wow"and from almost at the beginning, youve seen Ive been at the top like from almost day one.
The reason I tell you certain things and the reason I talk about what Ive done and lots of good things.
A little thing  Wollman ice skating rink.
The city couldnt get it built for high years.
They were in there for like $20 million.
They couldnt get it done.
I went to the mayor of New York, I said, "Ed Koch, Ill get it done real quick."
He didnt like it because he didnt want to be shown up.
I said Ill do it and if it costs more than $2 million Ill pay for it.
I got it built for peanuts.
Got it done in four months.
And we had ice skating in Central Park and I still run it.
I did another one  I did a bigger version of that recently Ferry Point out in the Bronx.
They were having  things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years.
They couldnt get it done.
I got it done under a year.
Its operating now.
Its very successful.
Its what I do and thats what we need.
Thats what we need in our country.
Im building on Pennsylvania Avenue an incredible hotel.
One of the great hotels of the world.
The Old Post Office site.
Think of it.
I got it in the Obama administration.
Everybody was bidding.
Everybody wanted it.
One of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA  general services.
And I got it.
Can you imagine me getting it from the Obama administration?
Because the GSA, who are really professionals, they want to make sure number one that it got built.
So they wanted strong financials.
And they also wanted a great plan.
So we came up with Ivanka and my kids we came up with this incredible plan.
The job is under budget, ahead of schedule.
It was going to open up in 17  sometime during the year 17.
Now, its going to open probably in September of 16 right before the election on Pennsylvania Avenue.
And this is the kind of mindset you need.
Carl Icahn, one of the great businessmen, and others have endorsed me.
We have trillions and trillions of dollars offshore.
Pfizers leaving the United States.
In the old days, somebody would leave for, frankly, South Carolina.
Theyd leave New York or Florida or someplace where the taxes are lower.
Theyd leave for North Carolina.
Theyd leave  today theyd leave this country for other countries.
So now, were losing Pfizer.
Were losing many of our great companies.
We have $2.5 trillion offshore at least.
And everybody agrees it should come home  the Democrats, the Republicans.
For three years, they cant make a deal.
They cant make a deal because theres such gridlock.
Theres no leadership in Washington.
We will make this country so great.
We have people and Ill tell you something.
Ill tell you something[interrupted by protester] said something to me the other day and what I really want to do  [interrupted by protester]  what we want to do or what I want to do is I want to be the peoples president.
Think of this, think of this, I dont work for any of the lobbyists.
I dont work for any of these people that are leading our country in the wrong direction.
We dont.
The best thing that Ive seen in going around and the thing that Ive seen more than anything else is how smart the people are.
They dont believe those people in the back that write with fork.
Im telling you, they dont believe them.
The people are really smart.
Whats giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that Ive met  the incredible people of this country.
Were going to make America great again.
And you know what?
Were going to make it greater, greater, than ever before.
And I love you all and thank you very much.
South Carolina.
Great.
Thank you!
We love you.
Thank you!
Thank you very much, everybody.
You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish.
Right?
She has a great husband, Jared, and Ill tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and shes very proud.
The only bad news, I cant get her on Saturday.
I call and I call.
I cant speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays.
But thats okay.
Its an honor to be with you.
You know, Ive devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they havent done what Ive done.
Ive received many, many awards.
I was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, "Dont do it.
Dont do it."
I walked up Fifth Avenue.
Im looking up for lots of trouble.
But I said, "No way am I not going to do it."
And it was a rough time as you know.
It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade.
Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had.
So, Im in a different position than the other candidates because Im the one candidate I dont want any of your money; I want your support but I dont want your money.
Im self-funding my campaign.
Its been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far.
I thought by this time Id have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa.
But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising.
And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it.
At first, I was embarassed by that.
I said, "You know, I think were going to have spend money just to spend money" but its not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot.
Its not even close.
Every single poll, every single state.
The numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire  the PPP poll  Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board.
They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right?
Most of importantly, favorability  no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%.
Thats ultimately the most important.
And you know, Ive been a tremendous fan and Ive been a tremendous contributor.
Ive given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response.
They do a fantastic job.
And my father, Fred, was always a big supporter.
So I grew up in that environment.
I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind.
In fact, Ive been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall.
Its loaded up.
But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you.
My Christians are liking me a lot lately and theyve been great.
They have been great.
So, Obama is the worst thing thats ever happened to Israel.
The worst.
The worst.
And when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-Israel, very  I mean, they love Israel.
They love it with passion, and theyre having fundraisers for Obama.
I said, "What are you doing?"
And its almost like they answer me and they say, "We dont know.
He comes to New York.
We dont know.
We dont know."
I said hes a disaster.
I really believe the Iran deal.
Look, Im a negotiator like you folks.
Were negotiators.
We dont build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million  can you imagine this?
A small gas station  $43 million  and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they dont sell that type of gas.
Okay?
$43 million for a gas station.
How many think they could have done it for less?
Would you raise your hands please?
But I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion.
They dont need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them.
They can buy them.
Its true.
Why do they have to develop them?
They can buy them.
We gave them $150 billion.
They go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect.
How about that?
On their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect.
Were going to let them self-inspect.
And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days were all good with contracts dont start until such and such happens.
It could be forever before you ever go into inspect.
And we dont even get our prisoners back.
And now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three.
They dont want to give us our four.
You know we have four.
But they only want to talk three.
Now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago.
And maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what Im saying.
It should have been you walk in  by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long?
And we conceded on every single.
We didnt win anything.
We didnt win anything.
But that should have been with our prisoners  day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back.
You dont want them.
We need them.
It will make us look better.
Both everybody is going to like us more.
With the American public, any deal that we strike, its going to look good.
And you say that.
We have to get our prisoners back.
Day one.
Theyre going to say, "No, were not giving."
And were going to say, "Bye bye.
Bye!
Call us when youre ready."
And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions.
I guarantee you within 48 hours theyre calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back.
Its so easy.
Now, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator Ive ever seen.
No, hes the worst negotiator Ive ever seen.
He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that.
Now, hes one of the few.
Hes one of the  biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didnt read it.
And Obama definitely didnt read it.
Obama, ayeyeye.
Oh.
But they said  this is hard to believe but this is what they said  a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I dont I end up with a  they said we didnt want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners.
Its really complicated.
We want our prisoners back.
Oh, so complicated.
They said they didnt want to complicate  so now, were going to end up making a new deal probably at some point.
Id tell you this, look Ill just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back.
Theyre going to be back, I guarantee you.
Theyre going to be back.
Now, our president doesnt want to use the term  we had another event, which probably was  the one yesterday  probably was related.
It always happens but it probably was.
When I heard about it, I figured maybe not.
But it turns out probably was related  radical Islamic terrorism.
And Ill tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term.
He refuses to say.
Theres something going on with him that we dont know about.
Now, as far as Hillarys concerned, shes going to go with what he wants.
She shouldnt be allowed to run.
What she did is criminal with the emails.
She shouldnt be allowed to run.
Shes going to have to follow his line because shes on a thread.
You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his U.S. Attorney, his Attorney General.
So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion.
I think its very dishonest whats going on with our government.
Gen. [David] Petraeus was given a life-changing sentence.
Other people have been sent to jail.
Petraeus was, you know, essentially  look, I dont want to get into it with the poor guy.
What he went  for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did.
And Obama, I mean, she cant go against him because only does boom she gets indicted.
Thats the end of it.
Thats the end of it.
So when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and hes got control of her.
I mean, its just total control.
But Ill tell you what, she shouldnt be allowed to run.
What she did was a criminal act.
And remember this, this is a six-year  you have a six year statute of limitations.
So shes fighting for her life.
If she doesnt become president, she could have a real problem.
Does that make any sense to anybody?
Does that make sense to anybody?
Because what she did was just wrong.
Okay?
And you know shes been involved in corruption her whole life, whether its Whitewater.
I mean, her whole life is corruption.
She was a horrible Secretary of State.
She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot.
She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done.
The whole  the world blew up around her.
It blew up.
500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didnt respond.
The truth is she doesnt have the strength or the energy.
She responded to her friends.
You know the friends were talking about.
Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there.
But she responded  yeah, you get that, right?
A lot of people dont get that.
But she responded to a friend, but she doesnt respond to an ambassador thats asking for help.
Hundreds  hundreds of requests and she doesnt respond.
Now, remember this, I go every night to someplace.
I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd.
The other day I was in Florida, we had 12,000 people in Sarasota at 12 p.m. with the football games going on.
12,000 people.
The convention center held 5,000.
So we had thousands outside.
I made a speech outside.
I made two speechesI said, "You cant get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech?"
My people said, "No, this is the biggest one.
We set a record  a big record.
We set a record everywhere.
We beat the record of Elton John.
Its true.
Elton John.
Im no longer competing with politicians.
Im competing with the musical talent.
One of the great musicians said "You get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar" meaning who doesnt count on music.
So its true, weve had tremendous response.
Weve had incredible response.
I think you know if you look at whats going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls  again I dont want your money therefore youre probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money.
Trump doesnt want money therefore we cant  even though hes better than all these guys, even though hes going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that.
But he asked me to do a commercial.
And they said I was the only celebrity.
I dont know if thats  but they said Im the only celebrity.
I dont know.
Im not a celebrity.
See now Im a politician.
Im so embarrassed by that term.
You know, my how life Ive been a business, Ive been a developer.
Ive employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company.
A lot of people said, "Oh, hell never file."
This youll get a kick out of.
"Hell never run because hell never want to file various papers.
And then hell never file this and that and then youd have to sign your life away."
The first paper  we all know about first papers.
You sign your life away.
Thats the end of it.
He did it.
Then they said, "Well, hell never sign and hell never file his financials because who knows, maybe hes not as rich as people think."
So I filed my financials  almost 100 pages.
The biggest ever filed by the federal elections.
And everybody said, "Oh my, its much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers!"
If I didnt run, Id probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible.
Its true.
Some of the greatest assets  Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan.
Just many  Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things
And the reason I bring that up is because thats the kind of thinking we need.
And I dont bring it up as braggadocio.
I bring it up because thats the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back.
We have people that dont know the first thing about the word negotiation.
I can take anybody in this office, believe me, and theyre better than Obama and theyre better than Kerry and theyre better than the foolish people  the foolish people.
Its so embarrassing when you see what happens.
Sergeant Bergdahl, all right?
Sergeant Bergdahl  we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that theyve wanted for nine years.
You know, the deal was five for one.
And they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal.
You know about Sergeant Bergdahl.
He deserted.
Six people were killed trying to get him back.
They were looking for him.
The general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, "No, he deserted.
He was a traitor."
And we still made the deal.
So we get a traitor.
We can give him back.
Do you want to re-negotiate deals?
Some of us will re-negotiate deals.
I would say about 99.9  is there anybody that doesnt re-negotiate deals in this room?
This room negotiates so I want to re-negotiate  perhaps more than any room than Ive ever spoken.
Maybe more.
Its okay.
Ive been called on that a couple of times too.
But the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal.
I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from.
The hell  they can have him even if we dont get the five guys back because thats not going to happen because you know where they are right now?
Theyre right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in.
So they get their five guys that theyve wanted for nine years theyve wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor.
But thats the way our people negotiate.
Theyre stupid people.
Okay?
Theyre stupid people.
Its very sad.
Its very sad.
So Ill just tell you that Im going to win.
I am.
Im going to win.
I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens.
But Ill tell you what, I have a great secret service.
Heres a nice one, youre number one, they give you a secret service.
I never saw so many people  talented people, great people.
But I believe Im going to win.
I really have just a great feeling about it.
And you know, my life has been about winning.
Ive won, and my life has been about winning, and thats what I want to do for the country.
And if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest.
Its like the other day  Ivanka, shes doing so great.
"Dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, "Honey, who cares?
How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka?"
Its amazing.
See?
Now Im dealing in trillions.
Ive never heard of trillions before.
You know, with this  we owe $19 trillion.
We just signed a budget thats so bad and the Republicans  you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from.
But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and theyre going to end Obamacare, which Im going to do by the way  Im ending, Im terminating, its going to be repealed and replaced with something much better.
But they go to Washington and theyre going to do this and theyre going to do budgets  like I heard the guy before "Were going to work in the budget."
Its all about that.
What happens is theyre going to do budgets like were going to do this and that and I tell this story  then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up "Darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels.
Oh, look at these magnificent floors."
Theyve never seen anything like it.
"Weve arrived.
This is incredible."
And then they become mainstream.
"Well vote on Obamacare.
Yes, I vote."
They dont want to leave.
They lose all of their courage.
I want to use a nice word because otherwise theyd get reported for foul language.
They lose all of their courage and theyve let us down.
That wont happen with me.
So, again, youre not going to support me even though you know Im the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and Ill be that.
I know why youre not going to support me and you know youre not going to support me because I dont want your money.
Isnt it crazy?
No, its true.
You know, if I wanted to have your money, I think Id have a damn good chance and I think Id get more money than anybody else.
Do you know the money I have turned down?
This has not been my life turning down money.
Guys want to give me millions.
I would have made  poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy.
Its sad.
No, its sad.
I came up with that term, it became so defining.
Its like having it on his forehead "I am low energy".
No, no, its sad.
He raised $125 million, which means hes controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money.
Thats why you dont want to give me money, okay?
But thats okay.
You want to control your own politician.
Thats fine.
Good.
Fine.
Think about that, folks.
Dont worry about it.
I understand.
Hey, five months ago, I was with you.
Whos better than me?
Who is better than me?
I gave $350,000 to the Republican Governors Association.
I never even gotten a letter of thank you.
Its true.
$350,000.
I didnt receive one letter, not one letter from one governor.
Stupid.
The good thing is I dont give any  why would I give any more?
You dont get a thank you letter.
Politicians  remember this  politicians forget, politicians generally arent competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and thats what youre going to end up having.
But I would love your support but I dont want your money.
I appreciate it.
Now, lets take some questions.
Okay?
Good.
Im going to go there right after this.
I have to go through  you know, you have to watch to make sure that the contractors arent stealing and ripping you off and everything else.
But to show you how important this forum is and how important the country is to me and how important Israel is to me, its so important, I dont mention my projects.
Its not like very important to me anymore.
Whats really important to me is the United States and making it great again.
My theme is Make America Great Again.
I mean, its taken off like crazy.
The hats  its going crazy.
But you know, some of these guys try to copy it but I had it trademarked because were smart.
A couple of them got up.
No, you see, I was making this speech and everybody stood up  make America great again But nobody stood up to them.
But we sent them a little notice  dont use that term.
Were trademarked.
Can you imagine I got the approval?
But we are  were building a great hotel down the road.
I hope you all stay and its going to be wonderful


So I was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters from AP and they did a very good job.
Very fair story.
And one of the questions was about Israel and the Palestinians whats going to happen.
I said  I used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to makeCan we think of any deals?
We all have tough deals, right?
You know, we have some good, some bad
But I said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other.
I believe  because Im a dealmaker  I believe that I can put both sides together.
But I said, itll take six months.
At the end of six months and maybe sooner  with us we have a deal instinct.
A lot of us.
And you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not youre going to make a deal.
I will know very quickly whether or not Ill be able to put that deal together.
I used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together.
Theres probably no tougher deal.
If I could do that, it would make me so happy because theres so much violence, so much death, and just been going on for so many years.
Now, I said you have to have a commitment to make it.
I dont know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it.
With that being said, you know, I have a good chance of winning because you look at whats going on.
So I have a good chance.
I dont like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that.
Id rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room.
I dont want one side or the other saying.
Look, I think people know where I stand.
But wouldnt it be great if they could make a deal?
But a lasting deal, a real deal.
Not a phony deal thats going to last a week and then bad things started happening again.
Id love to  and I will give it.
You know Obama, as you know he said it wont happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started.
But I think it would be a great thing for Israel  I think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made, and Im going to give it my best.
Im a great dealmaker.
Thats what I do.
I made a lot of money.
Im going to give it my best.
It would be great if that deal could be made.
By the way, Israel has given a lotAnd a lot of people dont know that.
I think the public relations for Israel hasnt been so great because Israels given a lot but hasnt been given a lot of credit for what theyve given
In fact, some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in Israel.
There were things given.
But Id like to go in with a clean slate and just say lets go, everybodys even, we love everybody, and lets see if we could do something.
But I do think this  and I do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons Im saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that Israel has given a lot.
I dont know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know thats going to be up to them.
But Israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what theyve done.
I will say that.
I will say that.
So thats it.
You know what I want to do?
I want to wait until I meet with Bibi.
You know, Im leaving for Israel in a very short period of time.
I know.
I know what youre saying.
I just  youre not going to be  whos the wise guy?
Do me a favor.
Just relax.
Okay?
Youll like me very much, believe me.
Okay?
And you wonder why you get yourself in trouble.
All right?
Youre going to like me very much.
Its going to be fine.
But again, you cant go in with that  if youre going to make a deal and you could make a great deal  you cant go in with the attitude were going to shove it down.
Youve got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyones happy.
Dont worry about it.
Youre going to be very happy.
Okay?
Dont worry about it.
I think hes a very good man.
I think hes been treated very badly.
I think that our president has been unbelievably rude to Bibi.
I dont know how many people like Bibi.
But I think hes been unbelievably rude.
And  I mean, well talk about deals after the fact, which is a shame but I think the Iran deal is the worst single thing.
Perhaps itll go down  and Ive been pretty good at predicting things.
I think its going to go down as the worst single thing thats ever happened to Israel.
I think its a catastrophe for Israel.
And I think the fact that Obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves Israel to support this guy or even the Democratic Party is impossible to believe.
I think it will be one of the great catastrophes.
But if I get in, I will straighten it out, believe me.
Its going to be straightened out.
Its going to be straightened out tough and its going to be straightened out fast.
The one bad thing is if I get in, the $150 billion is gone.
That hurts me and that hurts the people of Israel.
But the $150 billion is gone because itll be gone before you get there.
You know, were talking about a year and more actually.
Although the election very quick.
You know, its coming up.
Its now less than a year and you know we have the Iowa starts on February 1st and then we go right down the line and its very exciting.
Were talking about a couple of months now for it to start.
For a person like me, I mean, its very exciting.
Well, I havent been working too much with the Arab leaders, to be honest with you.
Okay?
You know, I told you I made commercials for Bibi.
I dont know if thats going to help me in the negotiation.
I can tell you.
You know, Im trying to keep it nice and level, right?
Then I get people screaming at me.
But Im trying to keep it as level as possible but I for the most part dont know.
The King of Jordan seems like a nice man.
I mean, I dont know.
Were going to see.
A lot of people like him; some people dont.
But I think I will probably be able  what my history  you know, I took some heat because I get along with Democrats, I get along with liberals, I get along with conservatives, I get along with Republicans.
I get along with everybody.
Thats what I was  Im a businessperson.
I get along with everybody.
We have to get along with everybody.
And I took some heat and I always explained that.
I said, "Wait a minute, Im a businessperson.
Ive got to get along with everybody."
I live in Manhattan.
Its all Democrat.
I mean, its virtually all  Republicans dont even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5%.
You know, they get a very small percentage of the vote.
Got to get along with everybody.
I think thats going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in Washington.
We have people that  they dont talk.
You know, I remember that years ago because Ive been a very political person on the other side but always very political.
But years ago, the Republicans and the Democrats  they used to like each other.
Theyd get along.
Theyd have dinner together.
Theyd argue and theyd fight and theyd disagree and would have, you know, different views and things.
But in the evening, theyd go out and theyd have dinner together with their families.
You dont see that anymore.
Theres total hatred and theres total gridlock.
Ill give you one point, which I think is important.
Corporate inversions.
Right?
So you have companies leaving the United States and theyre leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things.
A lot of things are better.
But theyre leaving.
Pfizer.
How good is Pfizer?
Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost.
But theyre also leaving because we have $2.5 trillion at least  I think its a much higher number than that.
$2.5 trillion  thats out of the country that these companies cant get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high.
Theyre so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out.
So they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because thats how much money.
The Republicans and the Democrats totally agree that the money should come back.
For three years they cant get a deal.
Theres no leadership.
Its gridlock.
Theres an example of something where everybody agrees  all the people that you see up here they all agree but they cant get it done because theyre politicians.
Theyre all talk; theyre no action.
So theres something and its so important.
Its not like something where they dont get  like theres big disputes and we understand that.
This is something everybody agrees  the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things  taxes paid.
But they agree and they cant get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership.
You know, honestly, I dont think anybody can say.
She says she is.
But now she says all of a sudden maybe less so than you thought because shes going very, very far over to the other side.
I mean, Bernie Sanders has brought her to positions that she didnt want to be at.
You look at some of the things that shes saying right now.
But Ill tell you what, whether she is or not, she doesnt have the strength or the energy to help Israel.
Im telling you she doesnt.
But just take a look.
Shell come out and do an event and you dont see her for another four days, three days, five days.
No, its true.
Think of it.
We dont need  some people say its not nice to say.
She doesnt have the strength or the energy.
Israel needs more than just our support.
They need strength.
They need real power behind them.
Because you know, you look at as these countries fall over there, Israels looking more and more  you know, Israel has some difficulties.
And one thing and I think youll all admit it.
These people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think.
Right?
We used to think "Oh, that was easy."
15 years ago with my friends from Israel because I have a lot of friends from Israel, they used to smile and laugh "Oh, dont worry about it."
Now theyre saying, "These guys are  theyre dirty fighters."
And theyre not bad.
You know, theyre tough.
Theyre not the JV.
Okay?
Obama said theyre the JV.
Theyre not the JV folks.
We need tough.
We need General George Patton.
We need General MacArthur.
We dont need the guys we have.
I see them on television  generals.
I dont want my generals on television saying "Well, ISIS is very tough."
I saw a guy the other day.
ISIS is very tough.
I dont know.
I dont need that.
Do you think General George Patton  they dont like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy.
So he would never make it.
They probably would have had him thrown out years ago.
But we need Patton.
We need a genius like MacArthur.
And we have those people.
We have those people.
Ill find that person.
But were going to knock the crap out of them, Ill tell you what.
Were going to win.
Were going to win.
Were going to win.
Well, I think radical Islam right now is, and I feel thats the greatest.
And again, we have a president who refuses to use the term.
But radical Islam is  Ill tell you one thing I know isnt is global warming.
Thats the one thingI know isnt.
I mean, we have a guy that just the other day who said  here they want to blow everything  this is right after Paris.
They want to blow our cities up.
They want to destroy our civilization, and hes worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax.
By the way, I won so many environmental awards shockingly.
No, its true.
And you know what I want to do?
I want really immaculate air.
I want clean, crystal water.
I want a lot of things.
Okay?
I want a lot of things.
But global warming  you noticed they changed the name  they go global warming, they go climate change, they go  now I hear a lot of extreme weather.
How can you miss with extreme weather, right?
If its cold, its okay.
If its hot, its okay.
If its windy, if its hot  everything is extreme.
So now they use extreme weather.
It is a disgrace whats going on.
And to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left.
Thank you.
Thank you very much everybody.
Its a great honor.
I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers.
For years and years, Ive heard about Simon and Schusters being a fabulous  I was going to say the Rolls-Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one.
And I want to thank you very much.
Youve given us such tremendous support.
And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively.
Its been an incredible experience.
We wrote a book and the title  "Crippled America"  is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons weve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is.
We tell the truth.
And America is crippled.
We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now its actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt.
We have a military that doesnt have proper instruction from leadership.
We dont know what were doing.
Were losing all over the world with trade deals.
Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, theyre beating us in trade.
And we cant go on like this any longer.
Its impossible to go on like this any longer.
I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor.
We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly.
And thats not the way its going to work anymore.
So we write about it in the book.
We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things.
And I think its going to be very instructional, very important.
To me, it was instructional.
When I did "The Art of the Deal", I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional.
Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book "The Art of the Deal" and the other books weve done.
So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time.
We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to whats going on right now.
Its a moment of time.
And we got it done.
And David did a fantastic jobAnd all of my people did a great job.
They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now.
So this was not easy getting this in.
But we see by the lines  the lines go down to Park Avenue.
Theyve been forming since last night and Im going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m.
Were doing a couple of interviews and then were signing books starting at 12 p.m. and thatll be very exciting for me.
But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours.
I dont know how theyre doing this but they do it.
They find a way.
So Im looking forward to getting to the signings.
Well, I think its a different book.
You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where Im leading.
You saw the new poll from Iowa.
You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where Im leading big.
A poll just came out in Florida where Im leading big.
Georgia, Texas.
I mean, all over the place.
And I think you know look were doing well.
And if you add Ben and myself were beating everybody by a lot.
That seems to be the big story that were beating  they call it the establishment.
Its called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down.
But I dont know.
I dont know how his book is doing.
Well, I think my book is very hard-hitting.
His is a different kind of book and hes a different kind of a person.
My book is very hard-hitting.
It says it like it is.
And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, its selling like hotcakes.
So well see.
Were very different people.
We have very different qualities and we are extremely different.
And Im different from all of the other candidates.
Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me.
We are going to take the $400 billion a year that were losing with China, thats going to be turned around.
The $75 billion a year that were short on with Japan.
The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico.
And thats right, there will be a wall built.
It will go up.
It will be built.
And people will come into the country legally.
So I mean, much different than  youre look at Marco Rubio  very, very weak on illegal immigration.
You look at Ben and hes very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare.
I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare.
You cant get rid of Medicare.
Itd be a horrible thing to get rid of.
It actually works.
You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse.
It works.
So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I dont know how he stays here.
No, I think that really Marco is over-rated.
And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message.
I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasnt been able to  Marco doesnt show up to the United States Senate.
Hes representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and Im way up in Florida over everybody.
But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesnt show up for the people of Florida, and I dont think he should be doing that.
Now, Bush gave a very weak message.
I agree with that.
It was poorly delivered.
But the facts are on Bushs side and ultimately I think Marcos going to be hurt very badly.
And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where hes coming from, I think people are going to say, "Whoa, we didnt know that."
But look at Marcos stance on illegal immigration.
Its really trouble for him.
I dont see how he can win.
Marco Rubios personal finances are discreditAll you have to do is look at his credit card.
I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards.
And Ill tell you what, I love Florida.
Im in Florida all the time.
And for years, Ive been hearing that his credit cards are disaster.
I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that.
But his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, Ive heard about it for years.
Youll have to find out.
Well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his  you know, he certainly lives above his means.
Theres no question about that.
Ill tell you what.
On the debates, its very interesting.
Because I dont really care that much.
I want a room.
I want a podium.
And lets get going.
Because I dont really care that much.
But a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect  many of them, not all of them  but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls.
I mean, she wasnt asked one tough question.
They didnt talk about her foundation.
They didnt talk about any of the problems.
They didnt talk about the emails.
When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign.
I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint.
In order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails.
That was end of his campaign.
First of all, people arent going to his rallies anymore.
Hes finished.
So unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, shell easily be the candidate.
But I will say this: She only got softballs.
Thats all she got.
And if you look at the way we were treated, it wasnt the same way.
With that being said, I dont really care.
Well, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall.
They coalesced at that last debate because I mean, it really started with me.
The guy asked me a question.
I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter.
Hes a disaster.
And he was  it was such as horribly put question and so obvious.
And the Republicans coalesced around each other.
It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it.
And all we want to do is to be treated fairly.
But with me, I dont care that much.
Just give me a podium.
What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else.
You know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didnt even want to broadcast it because nobody watched.
Okay?
Nobody wanted to watch.
Now, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people.
I mean, give me a break.
So somebody said, "How did they get there?"
And actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well  much better than the political press  they said "solely for one reason  it was Trump".
Ill take the credit.
But Ill tell you what I also want.
I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates  enormous profits  by the way beyond anything theyve ever envisioned.
CNN was going to get $2,000 for a 30 second ad.
They ended up getting $250,000.
So they went from $2,000 to $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
The networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans.
Thats what I want.
Im giving them away.
Im giving the profits of my book  Im giving them away to a lot of different  including the vets.
I have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women.
This building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didnt see that in the construction trades.
I mean, it was totally unique.
I have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women.
Many  a proportion thats close to 50%.
Might even be over 50% if I analyze it.
And they get paid a lot of money  in many cases more than men doing the same job.
So women have always appreciated that about me.
Ive been in terms of employment really a standout and Ive been honored for doing so well with women.
What Jeb Bush was saying at the last debate?
I dont know.
But he didnt say it well.
I like Telemundo by the way.
I like it better than Univision.
Im suing Univision for $500 million.
Because the country is doing so poorly.
Its a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly.
Thats good.
Theyre going to have some demonstrations.
Oh, good because itll get even higher ratings if they do that.
I think its fine.
I think they should demonstrate.
Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be.
Its going to be one of the highest rated shows ever.
And theyre very excited about it.
And I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics.
Youve treated me actually very fairly.
Won the poll recently in Nevada.
Won other polls.
And in Nevada, I think I got 37% and leading everybody.
So I have a great relationship with the Hispanics.
I have working for me thousands right now  thousands of Hispanics.
Ive had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me.
Im a job machine.
Im a job machine.
And one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close.
Im two, three, and you see that  two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else.
And youd almost say like its about the jobs, its about the economy.
Then hows anybody going to beat Trump in all fairness?
But Ive had a great relationship with the workers.
Ive had a great relationship with jobs.
And Ive had an amazing relationship with the Hispanics.
And I predict that Im going to win the Hispanic vote.
I think Im going to win the Hispanic vote.
I predict, yeah, I think Im going to get the nomination and I will win the White House.
I think beating Hillary Clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad.
Thats the question I like.
How am I preparing for my SNL?
Well, Im meeting with Lorne Michaels in a little while.
Afterwards, were going to sign  I guess got thousands of people on line but were going to sign and then later on this evening Im meeting with Lorne Michaels and the whole staff and well start the preparation.
Well pick our skits.
Am I nervous?
Not too nervous.
Not too nervous.
But were going to do a good job and were going have a fantastic show.
Were all going to have a lot of fun.
My Jeb impression?
No, I dont want to do that.
I dont like showing a person sleeping at the podium.
Tom is asking "Can Jeb make a comeback?"
I think its going to be very hard.
Very hard.
Not about money.
I just think  you know, I came up with the energy.
And I just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track.
You cant do that when you dont have that.
I think Marco is highly overrated.
Highly overrated.
He doesnt have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things.
Jeb  he lacks the quality that you need.
Were talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off.
You need a very strong person with tremendous energy.
Thank you very much folks, Ill take the job.
But and its so important.
And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy.
We need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money.
You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President.
We have a president right now that doesnt have energy.
I mean, you think Obama has energy?
He has no energy.
And hes been a horrible president.
We need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect.
And certainly Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion.
From the Guardian.
Ah, they treat me very nicely in Scotland.
Go ahead.
Well, we just went over that.
Honestly, we just went over that.
And its only going to make it harder.
Youre going to see what were going to do.
Youre going to see.
But the whole thing with anchor babies, I turned out to be right.
A person has a baby, lives in Mexico or lives in Asia or lives in many different place, has a baby, walks across the border, has the baby here.
Now, were responsible for that person for the next 85 years.
I dont think so.
And by the way, I was right, they were wrong.
The 14th Amendment does not give them clearance on that.
And if you wanted to do that in Mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country.
You would be laughed out of the country so fast.
So, that turned out  I was 100% right.
Well have to worry about that.
Were going to take care of it, and its going to be done in a very humane way.
But were going to bring back our country and were going to have a wall and Mexicos going to pay for the wall and you know why theyre going to pay?
And I have great relationships with Mexico and phenomenal relationships with the Mexican people.
Phenomenal.
And they buy apartments from me; they work for me by the thousands  by the thousands.
Phenomenal relationships.
But let me just tell you we lose so much money with Mexico in terms of trade imbalance  $45 billion last year.
Plus, we give Mexico billions and billions of dollars.
They will pay for the wall.
And it will be very interesting.
And you know what?
People are going to come into this country but theyre going to come in legally.
A lot of European countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration.
Well, walls work.
All you have to do is ask Israel.
Walls work if its properly constructed.
Not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace  all talk, no action politicians  they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it.
Walls work.
All you have to do is go and see Israel.
They will tell you that walls work.
We need pomp and circumstance.
Our country has no spirit.
Our country has no gravitas.
Our country doesnt feel good about itself.
And the primary reason is we have no victories.
I mean, where have we had a victory?
Where have we had a victory in trade?
Where have we had a victory as an example this horrible deal that was signed with Iran where weve given them $150 billion and we lose everything.
We lose everything.
Its a laughing stock.
Worst deal.
Worst contract Ive ever seen drawn.
We have no victories.
And I do write about it.
We need some pomp and circumstance.
We need spirit.
We need a cheerleader.
I thought seven years ago when Obama got elected, the one thing I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country.
Hes not.
Hes been a great divider for the country.
Hes been one of the great dividers of all time.
Im not saying dress.
It has nothing to do with dress.
It has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive.
He has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened.
Ill go anyway they want.
I dont care too much about the debates.
Look, Im the one that gets all the nasty questions anyway.
Nobody else gets the really nasty questions.
In a certain way, maybe theyre defending me although I will tell you theyre not doing it for that reason.
I think its irrelevant.
I just  I like the debates.
Ive had the debates.
Ive done well in the debates.
As you know, every single poll said I won all three debates.
Now, I dont know if I did or not but I certainly didnt do badly.
But every single poll says  even CNBCs poll said I won the debate.
So I like the debates.
I think theyre good for me.
But we have to be treated a little bit fairly.
As an example, Hillary Clinton  no tough questions.
I mean, why didnt they ask about Bill?
Why didnt they ask about all of the different things.
No tough questions.
Now, that was staged by the Democrats.
And frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it.
Well, were going to stage something properly also.
But as far as Im concerned, I really dont care that much.
I just want a debate.
I think debating is a good thing.
Its healthy.
Gets everything into the open.
But you dont want people like Harwood that read a question  blah, blah, blah  that he wrote  that he carefully wrote.
He thought he was such  his career  in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened.
He could ask about anything you want.
I mean, you have to ask about anything you want.
Hillary had only softballs.
All night long.
It was like this  "Here, Hillary, hit this one out of the park."
Are you from Russia?
All right.
I think our relationship with Russia will be very good.
Vladimir Putin was on 60 Minutes with me three weeks ago.
Right?
Putin.
And they have one of the highest ratings theyve had in a long time.
So Im going to give him total credit.
But we will have a very good relationship I think with Russia.
Now, maybe we wont.
But I believe we will have a very good relationship with Russia.
I believe that I will have a very good relationship with Putin.
Sounds okay to me.
Well, I think there are a lot of economic issues.
We didnt talk about trade.
We didnt talk about devaluations.
Right?
We didnt talk about corporate inversions, which by the way, none of the other candidates, they dont even know what it means.
But we didnt talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country  massive companies  because they cant get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere.
So theyre leaving and theyre taking their jobs with them.
The corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about.
These were all things that werent talked about at the debate.
Instead, they talked about fantasy football.
I mean, it was a big question  fantasy football.
Im saying what about corporate inversions?
$2.5 trillion at least.
I think its probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they cant get the money back to invest in this country.
So they dont talk about corporate inversions at the debates.
They talk about fantasy football.
Those are the few.
I was against the war in Iraq.
You know, it was very early on.
Ill give it to you.
Yeah, I have it upstairs
Well, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer.
A lot of people didnt care about my view in 2003 and 2004.
But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq.
And I said very strongly exactly what happened.
I said you will destabilize the Middle East and when you destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq.
Thats exactly whats happening.
And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen.
The other bad things are ISIS.
I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that.
Ive felt that for a long time.
Do I think that its time for some of the other Republicans in the race that registering zero  in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which I assume is a mistake because thats less than zero.
I assume thats not happening.
Do I think its time to have some of the other Republican candidates drop out?
Yes.
There are too many people.
Well, I dont want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers.
Look, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and theyre at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out.
Like, you know, look at me.
I go to Florida and look at the numbers that just came out in Florida.
37%?
Georgia.
I mean, those are real numbers.
These numbers that these people have  and I often ask myself.
I asked Mark yesterday, "What are they doing?
Do they do this for their brand?
Because I happen to think its very bad for their brand."
I think [Scott] Walker did a good thing.
I think the way Walker  he saw it wasnt happening, wasnt going to happen and he just got out quickly.
You know, he was favored.
Dont forget.
You know.
That was before Trump was going to happen.
Right?
But he was favored for a period of time.
Favored.
Walker.
Gov.
Walker.
They thought he was going to win.
What happened is he got out.
I think the way he got out was great.
I think he did a really smart thing for himself.
And frankly, other people should get out because I would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the United States and more importantly how we can solve the problems.
So its a great question.
People should get out.
Ivanka.
Oh, they just said one of the biggest applause lines  its true  I get is when I talk about my daughter Ivanka.
She was just at Fortune Magazine for like something like Woman of the Year which is greatBut Ivanka is going to be very involved and Melania is going to be very involved very soon.
Theyre going to be coming out very soon.
Oh, Ivanka is going to Iowa.
When are you going to Iowa?
Very soon.
I would say  I dont see threats.
I mean, whatever it is I have to do.
Mark is saying "What are the top threats to your candidacy?"
Who knows?
I mean, youre in the crazy world of politics.
People change their minds.
Im going to make America great again.
Nobody else is going to be able to do that.
Im going to do it.
Im going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think thats awfully tough to compete with.
And one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there  I showed some of the developments that  I have many, many more because you can only  Simon and Schuster  you actually kept me to eight or nine pages.
Right?
And there are four or five in a page.
But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago.
Now its even better but we didnt have that certified yet.
So I do that not in a braggadocious way.
I do that because thats the kind of thinking our country needs right now.
We are run by people that are incompetent.
We are run by people who in so many words  I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word.
Unless they have bad intentions which I dont believe they do.
But we are run by incompetent people.
We have incompetent leadership.
There are so many things.
Like I mentioned corporate inversion.
The Democrats want the money to come back.
Who doesnt?
The Republicans want the money to come back.
For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back.
For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%.
You have a vast majority.
Maybe everybody.
For three years.
Guess what?
They havent done anything.
Right?
They cant even get along when they agree.
So heres the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they cant do it.
Thats a part of the problem.
Well, youre going to look  a lot of controversy with Mr. Singer.
A lot of controversy with Mr. Singer.
There are those people that probably wouldnt have want him to back.
But well see.
Ill talk to you.
No, they all agree.
They all agree.
They just didnt want to go through the unfair questions because they werent questions; they were statements.
You see, they were asking  they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way.
And by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific.
But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does.
But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person.
I think Carl is a terrific person.
But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC.
The question is should the Fed raise rates?
They are not raising them because Obama has asked them not to raise them.
In my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen.
And in my opinion, Janet Yellen is highly political and shes not raising rates for a very specific reason because Obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesnt want to see a big bubble burst during his administration.
Janet Yellen should have raised the rates.
Shes not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesnt want her to.
And if she does it, you see what happens every time theres even a thought of raising them just a little bit.
And one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies.
Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, theyre making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we dont have leaders that know how to say to China, "Dont do that.
Dont do that.
Because if you do that, were going to put a big fat tax on you.
Dont do that."
And you know what?
If you said that, they wouldnt do it.
If you have the right messenger






Im really focused on one very big election, one very important election, and there are some pretty good elections.
Im not watching any of them in particular.
Ill be watching them on Tuesday night.
But Ill be out there; well be out voting.
But the election that Im watching is the election for the presidency of the United States.
That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections weve ever had in this country.
Were so far behind.
And we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership.
Thats a good question.
Okay.
So, Simon and Schuster came up to me.
They wanted to do a book.
They wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and thats what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country.
And I said, "Ill do it but we have to talk about the country."
What happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture.
And he did some greatphotos.
Im smiling.
Im happy.
I look good.
Everything was fine.
And then he took one where I wasnt like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture.
And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one.
Its a terrible, horrible, nasty picture.
But when youre talking about "Crippled America" and youre talking about all of the problems we have, I cant have a big smiley face up there.
So thats how we picked it.
We picked the worst photo taken of me.
I would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesnt go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me.
Okay?
Are the other Republicans afraid to debate?
Well, some of them should be.
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you.
I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought wed do this well this fast.
This has been so incredible.
Whats happened all over.
Whats happened in Iowa.
Its been really incredible.
Weve had some amazing results and they continue to come in.
Got a little shake-up in Iowa.
I dont know whats going on.
Somebody said "Are you going straight to New Hampshire?"
Now, I love New Hampshire.
Weve got great numbers.
38 to 12.
Thats good.
But we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be.
And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds.
Everybody said and its very true.
I mean, look at this.
Somebody else would come, theyd have like 50 people and they wouldnt need this room.
Believe me.
But everybody said without question in every poll  this isnt just here  that the people that are with Trump are with Trump.
They dont go anywhere.
Theyre staying.
Its true.
I see it.
I see it.
And weve seen it.
You know, a couple of times I say "Well, that could be the end."
Then they do something and Im 10 points up.
Its the craziest thing, right?
But well take it.
But they say the people are with  we have the most loyal people by far.
Everybody says it.
The other thing they say is for leadership, number one.
Very important, right?
Dont you think?
Leadership.
I mean, when leadership is number one  they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot.
So you know its great.
I thought Id talk a little bit and I want to take some questions.
You know, we can do a little question and answer.
Right?
We have all these cameras going back here.
And you know, its always tough when youre on live television all the time.
Look, we have 10 topics.
Right?
How many topics?
10?
How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics?
The bottom line is we want results.
We want to get it done.
But when youre on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then youre talking about immigration and youre talking about the wall because were going to have a wall and were going to stop illegal immigration.
But we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare.
And we talk about all the things that we talk about.
But you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples.
But in the end, its really about results.
Isnt it?
Its really about results.
And you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways.
I talk about industry.
I talk about commerce.
I talk about how were losing our jobs to all of these different countries.
And I give different examples.
But its still going to be a certain number of subjects.
I talk about Second Amendment.
I talk about Fourteenth Amendment.
We talk about amendments.
You know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you.
They really want to do things and its not going to happen.
Its not going to happen.
At least with me its not going to happen.
That I can tell you.
So I said today you know well talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers.
I want you people to excite me for a change.
Is that okay?
I want to be excited.
And so were going to have some fun.
Were going to do that.
A few things  I want to bring up a few new subjects.
So, immigration, were going to be doing a very strong number.
Its killing us.
Its killing us.
And its bad for the economy.
Its bad for  all of this illegal immigration.
And I have to tell you legal  you come in and were going to have a good time and youre going to be there and youre going to do great  and visas  maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and well do something, were not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form.
Were going to make our economy much, much stronger.
But were also going to get jobs for people that are here.
People with us.
Were going to get jobs.
Were going to get jobs.
But the illegal immigration  you know, I did this and I made my determination  I took a deep breath.
Because Ill tell you what, it takes courage to say Im going to run for president.
It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business.
I love doing it.
I may never even see it.
I mean, I own some of the great properties in the world.
Doral in Miami.
I may never see it again Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that.
I may never see it again.
All of these incredible places that I have.
But more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, youre putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybodys done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it.
Now at some point some of these guys have to leave.
Dont we agree?
Its getting ridiculous.
Because like tomorrow night were having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate.
Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours?
You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long?
Hillarys debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was  oh  it was  you couldnt watch it.
You have Hillary against a socialist/communist.
And honestly, hes not going to win.
Just so you understandHes not going to win and neither is she
Well, shes being totally protected because in theory she shouldnt even be allowed to run.
Shes being protected.
Its a tough game and its a nasty game but shes being totally protected.
But shes going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys.
OMalley.
So hell be out quickly, I guess.
I dont know whats he doing.
What do they do when they have zero?
They have zero.
And I wouldnt say it against our folks.
But theyve treated me  some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right?
Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points.
And you know what?
Im not going to even mention names.
Usually I do.
I love doing it.
But everybody thats hit me so far has gone down.
Theyve gone down.
And theyve gone down bigly.
And a couple of the ones and zeroes  theyre the ones that hit the hardest.
I mean, theyre like desperate people.
But they hit.
One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left.
That means less than zero.
And I dont understand.
What does it mean?
I assume its a typo but maybe not.
But when you look at the things that are happening with our country  the trade situation with not just China  I talk about China all the time because thats the main abuser, thats the biggest abuser.
The numbers are astronomical.
Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance.
Think of it  $400 billion a year.
And they send stuff over here but we cant send stuff over there.
They tax us.
Big tax.
A friend of mine cant get stuff over there.
The tax is so big.
Big tax.
Somebody bought an airplane in China here.
Cant get it over there.
Spoiled guy.
Rich guy.
Bought a beautiful plane.
Cant get it over there because the tax is so massive that hes now selling in this country because China wont let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax.
I wont even tell you what the tax is.
Its so astronomical that I dont even believe them myself.
So Im not going to say it because those guys will say "Well, he was wrong."
All I can tell you is its a massive tax.
Like you dont buy planes here because if you do, you wont be able to get them back in.
And here, we accept all of their products.
So we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China.
We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan.
We have a  you know, with all thats going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer  a relatively small ship  over there, I dont know if Id want to be the captain of that ship right now.
But theyre being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen.
But you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan.
I love China.
I love all these people.
But their leaders are killing us because theyre smarter, sharper, more cunning.
The leaders of Mexico are killing us at the border and in trade.
Theyre taking so many of our companies.
Even Nabisco  my Oreos  theyre taking Nabisco.
Right?
Im never eating Oreos.
I tell it all the time.
They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I dont want to touch them.
Bring them back.
I yelled out to bring them back.
But Im not happy.
Theyre leaving Chicago and theyre moving their big plant to Mexico.
So when you see this happening, we have to stop it.
And Im not going to beat around the bush and "Oh, lets talk and lets be nice and lets say  " Nobody can do it like I do it.
Nobody.
Honestly, nobody.
We can  Im not saying Im perfect because Im not perfect.
Nobodys perfect
Now, nobodys perfect.
But Ill tell you when it comes to that stuff Im really  theres nobody better.
Carl Icahn endorsed me the other day.
Hes one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers.
He says Trump, Trump.
And hes not somebody that just do it.
He wants somebody that knows what theyre doing.
He understand.
You talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on.
Corporate inversions.
You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively.
They think $2.5 trillion overseas right now.
They cant get it in.
And everybody agrees that we should bring it in.
The Democrats and the Republicans.
Theyve agreed for years.
They cant make a deal because they have no leader.
Its not like "Oh gee, we disagree on Obamacare.
Or we disagree on something else."
Although I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because Im friendly with all of them.
Im friendly with like Republicans.
I get a long with everybody.
You know, everybody says "Oh, you wont be a unifier".
Ill be the greatest unifier of all.
Why is Obama a unifier?
But I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times.
Right?
"You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everythings going to be great."
Turned out to be a total lie.
28 different times that they know of and they wouldnt have done it.
But when you look at whats happening with corporations and the highest tax  we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country  but they have trillions of dollars overseas.
And these are great companies in many cases.
They have thousands of employees.
They cant get their money back.
And the reason is bureaucracy.
Its very hard.
And also big reason the tax is too high.
They dont want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax.
Theyd rather leave it over there.
And if they bring it back, theyll be using it to invest in our country.
I mean, a lot of good things will happen.
I happen to believe its more than $2.5 trillion.
But heres the thing and I use it because its so incredible.
Heres the thing.
Its not controversial.
Its not like you have the Republicans here and you have  everybody agrees.
Theyve agreed you know that for 2.5, 3 years.
They cant make a deal.
And now whats happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States  two reasons  lower taxes but also to get their money.
Theyve got billions of dollars overseas.
Theyre leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax.
And youre talking about one company I know of  I dont know how much theyve written about it  but youre talking about 6,000 jobs just one company.
Youre talking about potentially thousands of companies.
And I say it, in the old days, theyd leave New York.
People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or theyd move to Texas or theyd leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and theyd move to another location.
Right?
Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries.
Thats whats happened.
In the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, its a different world out there.
And theres no loyalty.
Theyre paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; theyd like to move back to these countries.
They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places.
And they dont mind.
They dont have loyalty to the United States.
So my plan, my tax plan, is something Im very proud of.
Were going to solve corporate inversion.
Ill tell you what, we will have that money back  if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin.
Nobody else will be able to do it.
Nobody.
Honestly, nobody else even knows about it.
The other candidates, most of them dont even know about it.
Its not their wheelhouse.
Okay?
Its not their thing.
Its not their thing.
Their thing is getting re-elected.
Thats what theyre good at.
They get re-elected.
And they make promises and theyre all talk and theyre no action.
And the same things happen with these politicians.
Its always the same.
So we have so many different things and what Ive done with our tax plan, which something Im very proud of, weve brought it down to a few groups.
Because right now, you have to go out  people who arent doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans.
Theyll pay $500, $1,000 because its so complicated.
And were going to make it nice and simple.
And were getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love.
But were getting rid of it.
They dont love me so much anymore.
But I dont care.
And were getting rid of a lot of things.
So were going to have a nice simple tax return.
Somebody said "Oh, why isnt everybody paying?"
You know, 40%  a big percentage  will not pay any tax at all.
People that are doing badly.
They said  well, I wont use the candidates name because I dont want to insult any candidate when they cant defend themselves.
They said "We want everybody to pay at least something."
And I said, "I agree."
Heres the problem.
From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, youre talking about millions and millions of returns.
Youre talking about building the IRS even bigger and its a monster.
And I could cut it down way down.
And the money that youre talking about is far less than the administrative costs.
So I said, "I agree.
Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, its too much.
Most of these people arent paying anyway."
What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan.
I was in Los Angeles.
Ships  the biggest ships youve ever seen.
Cars are pouring off into this country.
Made in Japan.
We give them practically nothing.
The balance is so bad.
The imbalance is so bad.
And then we have all the strikes.
See, what our people dont know and only somebody that wrote "The Art of the Deal" or does this stuff.
Its natural.
Its like a great athlete.
Like a Jack Nicklaus.
He was always able to sink that putt.
Right?
You know, hes just better.
And you have athletes  very few  but there are some people that have a certain ability.
A lot of people dont even know we have all the power.
We have all the power in China.
You know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1.5  think of this  trillion.
$1.5 trillion.
Think of this.
They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars.
But they take our business.
They take our jobs.
Factories close down all over the place.
And we owe them money.
Right?
Its a magic act.
For them not for us.
For us its a horror show.
Its going to end.
Its going to end.
And people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators  I know the best negotiators in the world.
Some I think are horrible people.
Ill be honest with you.
I dont care.
Do you care if theyre horrible people?
Who cares?
Now, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but hes a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and hes built a fortune.
He doesnt want money.
He doesnt want to say, "Oh, give me $200,000 a year in government money."
He wants to do it.
Hes proud to do it.
He wants to help the country.
And its so easy for him.
For instance, if I say "Carl, do me a favor.
The trade deal we have with China is so unfair were losing $400 billion a year.
Carl, do me a favor.
Make it fair."
I dont have to give him a big speech.
I dont have to give him a big speech.
I mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out.
I mean, things will straighten out and its going to be our benefit.
But think of it, if were losing that kind of money  that imbalance.
Its an imbalance.
Some people will say "Thats not really a loss."
It is a loss.
If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, thats a lot of money.
Believe me, I couldnt sleep.
If I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right?
But suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country?
Do you know the kind of money youre talking about?
Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen.
Lots of great things would happen.
And maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe theyll have 75% and maybe theyll like them better.
Maybe theyll be better.
And theyll be manufactured here.
Whenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs.
And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea.
They make all the television  other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit.
Sony is Japan.
But South Korea  LG, Samsung.
I dont get bids from American.
Id love to.
Id love to.
George Will said theres a company in South Carolina that makes television.
I said where are they?
Id like to have a good name too by the way.
Its important.
You know, when somebodys paying you a fortune for a hotel room, its nice to see a good name.
Right?
Do we agree?
Well, its a company in South Carolina but they dont make them there; they assemble them.
Theyll order parts that come in and theyll assemble them.
But much different.
But Id love it if we made them.
But you take South Korea.
We defend South Korea for essentially nothing.
You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way.
Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we dont talk about him.
We made the worst deal ever made with Iran.
Right?
The worst.
These are the people that represent  these people are incompetent.
Or stupid.
Somebody said, "You shouldnt say stupid.
Its not nice."
But its true.
Theyre stupid.
I think.
I mean, I think.
Unless I dont know is there something going on that we dont know about?
Think of it.
Point after point, we lost.
We lost everything.
Weve given them $150 billion.
Hard to believe.
They dont have to develop  I was telling somebody they dont have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it.
What the hell why should they develop it?
They can buy it.
And now all of a sudden theyre going into Syria.
They got so much money.
Theyre a terrorist state.
Theyre going into all of these different places.
Were fighting them in Yemen and yet were making a deal with them.
So why dont you say "Hey, Yemen out"?
Our prisoners  I want them back.
I want them back.
I dont want them over there.
I want them back.
And all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger.
Im the right messenger.
You know, Ive gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious.
Its terrible.
Right?
Because I cant be so nice and say "We can all do a wonderful job".
People cant do those kind of stuff.
For instance, the wall.
I said, I guarantee you that were going to build a wall.
Its going to be a real wall.
Were going to have people come through and theyre going to come through legally.
Or theyre going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it.
And we want people to come through.
I want people to come through.
I dont want to say no.
But we have at least 11 million  you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many.
You know, weve been hearing that number for years.
You know, like 11 million.
We have no idea.
I spoke to one of the top people.
They have no idea.
Might be 5 million.
Might also be 32 million.
Could be 50 [million]
But we have to get them out.
We have to  look, its harsh.
Dwight Eisenhower  we all like Dwight.
Right?
Remember the expression.
Right?
I go remember he got elected  "I like Ike".
How could he be bad?
All right?
And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton.
And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur.
I love them.
And were going to find ourselves a Patton and were going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women.
Were going to find ourselves a PattonBut were going to find a Patton and were going to find a MacArthur.
And Im really good at that.
Were going to find great people.
And Ive told this story where I watched these generals go on television  they shouldnt be on television.
They shouldnt be talking.
You know?
They shouldnt be talking.
They should be doing.
And they asked a certain general, Im not going to insult him.
It was like a month and a half ago.
On a show.
A talk show.
I said heres general so and so, one of the top, top, top people.
I said whats he doing on television?
And hes saying "Well, ISIS is very tough.
You know, they spread out."
By the way, they took the oil that I said take.
Remember I said "Take the oil"?
Always take the oil!
Theyre being funded by the oil that I said take.
I dont want their damned oil.
But you know what?
It turned out to be another benefit of having it.
Take the oil.
And we didnt do it.
We shouldnt have been in Iraq in the first place.
And I said that in 2003.
Shouldnt have been there.
We totally destabilized the Middle East.
We totally blew it.
But we were there.
Then Obama announces because hes so predictable "We are leaving on a certain date in a year."
Right?
I couldnt believe.
I was sitting there thinking "Did he really say that?"
He said "We will have all troops out by a certain date."
Right?
Did he say that?
I said "No, no, tell me please."
Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll?
Military.
They think Ill be the best in the military because they say I  you know, I always say Ill be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
I will.
But everybody knows that, especially God.
Everybody knows that.
But you know what Ill be?
Ill be the great at the military.
Ill be so good.
And Ill know when  and Ill build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobodys going to mess around.
Were never going to have to use it.
Were never going to have to use it.
And Im going to take care of our vets.
Believe me, theyre our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants.
Im going to take care of our vets.
So go back.
So the world is unpredictable.
I made a business deal a year ago.
And the guy  oh, I beat him so badly.
Aye, it was so beautiful.
It was a beautiful thing.
It was like a picture.
For me, it was like a picture.
Thats my own problem.
I guess.
But to me its like a painting when you could do something like that.
So I made this deal and it was great.
And they called.
They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story.
And I said, I hope they dont call this guy.
They ended up calling this guy "What do you think about Trump?"
And he said but in a respectful way, he said "He won because he was so damn unpredictable.
We dont know what the hell he was going to do."
Thats a positive.
Thats a positive.
I mean, if youre a poker player and youre predictable, youre not going home with much money.
Okay?
But it was really  I said, "Thats not nice what he said."
First, I said "Thats not nice.
Im unpredictable."
Then I said, "Wait a minute.
He meant that as a compliment."
And I called him.
I said, "What did you mean by that?"
He said "I think thats the greatest compliment I can pay.
We could not figure you out.
You came at us from 15 different angles."
So with Obama, when he announces that were leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldnt have been there but once you announced the bad guys  you know how they say the surge worked?
You know why the surge worked?
You know why?
Because the bad guys all moved back.
They said, "Hey, what do we have to get killed for?"
I mean, these people dont mind being killed, can you believe it?
But they said "If we dont have to, lets not."
So they moved back.
And they said, "Hey, theyre leaving in -" What was the date?
Do you remember the date?
Specific date to the day.
"We will have all troops out.
Im a great president."
So the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, "Oh, youre leaving in a year.
Going to have all the troops out.
Lets go back.
Why do we have to be shot at for the next year?
And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe hell change his mind and stay.
So lets let him think he has this great victory with the surge."
Right?
"The surge worked!"
What happened was that everybody pulled back.
They said, "Lets wait."
Now we leave because of a lack of leadership.
We leave and boom it comes apart.
Thats what happened.
That was the surge.
Everybody talk so much  "Oh, the surge was so great."
The surge was great because everybody knew  they knew what was happening.
They knew it was going to happen.
They knew we were leaving even through Bush.
I mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving.
They were fed up.
So they pulled back and they said, "Lets get them out."
Everybody wanted to leave.
Now, I would have done it differently.
Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not.
I wont even say.
People say, "Mr. Trump, whats your attitude on ISIS?
When will you attack them?
Where?
I say "You know, I dont want to talk  I have a real chance of winning.
I dont want to tell you what my attitude.
I want them to guess.
I dont really want to tell you."
I mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws.
Lets face it.
Hey, look at our leadership, its got flaws.
But you know the one bad thing?
When I gave that answer, they say  although some people  I see it here  some people say "We love that.
We love that."
But when I give that answer, some people say "Oh, Trump doesnt know.
He doesnt know.
He didnt give an answer as to exactly what hes going to do.
Exactly what hes going to do."
And I know exactly what Im going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, "You know, heres the problem.
If I dont give the answer, Im not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively.
So if I dont give the answer, Im not going to win."
Theyre going to say "Trump wouldnt give us the answer."
They dont know its unpredictability.
They dont know its strategy.
And I said for a period of time like a month, I said "I dont want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, Ive been on the top of the polls, almost at the top.
You know, were doing well."
Iowa, will you get your numbers up please?
Would you get these numbers up?
I promise you I would do such a good job.
First of all, I am a great Christian and I am.
I am.
Remember that.
And I do well with the evangelicals.
But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month.
I dont know what I did.
But I am a great Christian.
Im a believer and I believe in the Bible.
And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date  I wont tell you what date it was because possibly youd think Im younger than that.
But she didnt want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her.
So cute.
She has the address, has the date.
But I said to myself, "You know  "
By the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please?
This is ridiculous.
I mean, what is my competition?
In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition?
Do you think these guys  Im not going to say Carson  Im not going to say Rubio, who really is way down  I mean, I am second.
Its not like its terrible.
But I dont like being second.
Second is terrible to me.
But do you think that Ben is going to go to China?
These guys are fierce.
Like theyd come into your office.
Ive made many deals with China.
Ive had great victories in terms of deals with China.
They come into your office.
Theres no "Hello.
How are you?
Its a wonderful day."
They come in  "We want deal."
Theres no games.
I do this for a living.
Im really good at it, folks.
Really good.
And you know, when you talk about energy, Ill tell you one thing, everybody agrees  oh, do I have energy.
Oh.
I toss and turn thinking about how Im going to make the best deal for you folks.
Ill be tossing and turning.
I will be tossing and turning.
Youre going to have so many deals that is so good for you.
Were going to have numbers are going to be so good.
I always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning.
We dont win anymore.
You know, think about it.
Do we win at all?
Ever?
We lose with the military.
ISIS beats us.
Everybody.
We lose with trade.
When are we going to come back and say, "We beat China" on a deal?
When are we going to come back, "We beat Japan"?
Do you know that everybody said "Oh, Japan.
They have so power over us.
They have so much power because we owe them $1.5 trillion and they send all those cars."
They have no power.
If we ever say, "Listen, if youre not going to treat us fairly, we dont want your cars anymore", theyd go out of business, folks, theyre gone.
Same thing with China.
China is not even doing that well.
But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency.
The biggest in two decades.
And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, "Oh wow, we can get away with this and its going to make it impossible."
Did you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor?
Horrible.
Because theyre not getting stuff out because everybody  Japan and China in particular  is devaluing their currency.
Thats their number one weapon.
And the stupid trade deal that were making doesnt even cover it.
Thats their number one weapon and the trade that were making doesnt cover it.
So I only say this and you know what?
People might say "Its terrible.
Hes a terrible person, a terrible human being.
But Im going to vote for him anyways."
Okay, thats fine.
Im actually a nice person.
I always say this  nobody can do this stuff better than me.
And I know all the guys Im running against.
Theyre wonderful people.
Some of them I really like.
But who cares?
I was talking to one of the candidates the other day.
I was talking about corporate inversions and they didnt even know what the hell I was talking.
They had no idea.
Its not their thing.
And unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, were being eaten alive.
Thats why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that arent working.
Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%.
Its not 5.3%.
That was done for politicians so theyd look good.
Its not 5.3%.
How can you have 5.3% when you have 100 million people?
You look for a job.
If youre a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right therebut if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he cant get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed.
Its the most ridiculous thing.
We have a tremendous  tens of millions of people in that position.
They cant find jobs.
Theyre good people.
They want to work.
They cant.
But its not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good.
So let me just before we talk some questions, Im going to talk about something Ive never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it.
Its called Super PACs.
Its one of the great scams of all time.
Its one of the great scams.
So we sent out  I think I had  and its not me.
People set them up.
And I dont know.
Maybe theyre setting up for my benefit.
Lets take me.
A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC.
I dont talk to him.
I dont do anything.
I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11.
We dont even know.
Theyre all over the place.
Trump, Trump  one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book.
They have all these PACs.
And the money comes in.
And what do they do with the money?
I dont know.
And we arent supposed to call them or anything.
Okay.
So, we wrote a letter  a legal letter  to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we dont want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it?
If some guy thats having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think hes going to take ads for Trump?
Maybe and maybe not.
So we sent them a  its a scam, Super PACs, a scam.
Its a disgrace that we have.
A disgrace.
And Ill tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben.
Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money.
So when you read he has all this money, hes paying a lot of money and thats not reflected yet.
So when you hear they raised $20 million, theyre paying  now think of it, who pays  the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so Im telling you it may be off but you all know its a lot.
I think they said, 79 cents on the dollar.
Think of it.
To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be.
Somebody is making a fortune.
I know in Romneys campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars.
Millions.
They became rich raising money.
Its better than being a real estate broker.
For the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise.
Its a scam.
Its a scam.
Now, in Bens case, his Super PAC is running Iowa.
And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses.
Those are the bosses.
In the case of Jeb Bush, youre not supposed to deal with these Super PACs.
Okay?
So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day.
He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom.
Did you read that?
Two ballrooms.
One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course.
Theyre not supposed to be coordination.
Theyre not supposed to be talking.
Theyre right next to each other.
And thats nothing compared to what some are doing.
Its a scam and it should be stopped.
And its unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money.
And what happened and I havent talked about this before but Im seeing whats going on.
Its horrible whats going on.
What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall.
You know, they called it the wall.
And this is a wall too.
Wont be as good as the one Im going to build but its a wall.
But it was a wall and they didnt deal.
I mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, Im sure they never talk.
Im sure.
What do you think the chances are that they talk?
100% or 99%?
100%.
Id say 100%.
Id say 100%.
Only a foolish person would say 99%.
But whatever.
Theyre not supposed to.
But they put a friend in there.
They put other people in there.
They put whoever.
And thats the way it works.
And in some cases, I hear in Bens case, I hear in other cases, theyre literally running.
I mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what theyre all doing.
Thats why hes out of the race because he couldnt figure it out.
The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam.
So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find.
Theyre all over the place.
We want you to close the Super PAC.
We want nothing to do with it.
We dont want to get advertisements.
We dont want any of the money.
Go home and ideally give the money back.
They dont even have to give the money back from what I understand.
They can keep it.
Theyll probably if they actually raised money for me, theyll say "What a horrible thing he just said.
I think were going to support somebody else."
They could do that.
But the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office.
Total.
Nothing over me.
Nothing.
I feel its very unfair.
I feel its a very unfair situation.
Now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everythingBut what are they doing with this whole thing?
And I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest.
But the Super PACs are controlling your candidates  some more than others.
Some are unbelievable.
And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left.
When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign.
Youll be amazed.
I mean, its so little.
Bush, its the same thing.
And Ill go over  there are other names.
I know every one of them.
But its a horrible thing thats taking place.
And again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions.
Now, theyre not even going through the motions.
Theyre not even going through.
And just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars.
You can even check.
I said to John Deere, "I want an endorsement."
I dont know if theyll give me an endorsement.
Ill tell you if they dont theyre not so smart.
I guarantee no other person gave John Deere  I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments.
I love it.
You know why?
Iowa.
Iowa.
I love it.
I love it.
When we can.
By the way, its a great company.
Its a great company.
But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment.
I dont have to buy it from them.
I could buy it from others.
But I want to steer it to them when I can.
But we have to do something to clean up this political mess because its crooked stuff.
Its crooked stuff.
And its got to stop.
And its very unfair to people who go out and do it the way youre supposed to do it, including me.
I think Im the only one thats self-funding.
Im the only one putting up my own money, other than  I know its precious  people write in to DonaldJTrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20.
I keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100.
I dont want their money.
But if you send it back its totally insulting.
I mean, they always write letters too.
They write these beautiful letters  "Mr. Trump, I cant afford much and I know you dont need it but Im sending $50 because thats so important what youre saying about the country."
Its beautiful.
I mean, Ive seen such beautiful letters.
And if I send it back, theres no letter I can write thats not going to be insulting to those people, really.
"Dear Mr.
So and So or Mrs.
So and So, I dont need your money and thanks a lot but were going to do it ourselves."
If I got that back, Id say "Who the hell does he think he is?"
So we take that and its something that I think is important.
So I always preface it by saying I dont consider that funding but Im self-funding my campaign and Im getting ready to put up millions, millions.
And something Im very proud of that I think its great and its you know really great, it hasnt gotten very much publicity, hasnt gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate.
Okay?
By far.
I think.
I dont know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go aroundBut I was told that I spend less.
And I have the best results because in most polls Im number one.
Now, until Iowa came along, I said "every poll", and then Iowa  what the hell are you people doing to me?
You know?
You know?
Im telling you.
They said, "Why dont you skip Iowa?"
They told me that.
Everybody said "Skip Iowa".
All of the political geniuses.
A man just interviewed me back there, great reporter.
Hes actually a great reporter.
Of course, if he writes a bad story, I wont say that.
But he is.
Hes a great reporter.
And he said, "Would you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire?
And then youd go to South Carolina" where Im leading by massive  yeah, youve got to see the rallies there.
Theyre incredible.
"But youd go to New Hampshire.
Youd go to South Carolina.
You go to Nevada.
You go to the SCC."
I said I cant do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think were going to win.
I really do.
I believe it.
I believe it.
And I dont want to skip Iowa.
I think were going to do well.
I think were going to do great with evangelicals.
I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think Im going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal.
I will tell you that.
Im the real deal.
So I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination.
Okay?
I want to take away some of your muster.
You understand that.
So could we do  and please do me a favor?
Let me win Iowa.
And then Im going to win, Im telling you were going to win New Hampshire, and were going to win South Carolina.
A great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while.
A PPP poll.
It was great.
Some of you saw that.
But great poll.
But were going to go on and were going to win.
Were going to win.
And actually, one of the pundits  because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits.
A lot of pundits said "Hell never run.
Hes not going to run."
Theyre still trying to recover.
But one of the very smart one says "If Trump wins Iowa, its over."
Its interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great.
And I thought it was good here.
Come on.
Okay, so thats the end of that.
But I want to tell you, will you  I refuse to say "Get your asses in gear."
I will not say that.
I will not say it.
I will not say it because I dont want to use anything thats even a little bit off.
So will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory?
And if I win Iowa, were going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and were going to have such a great military and were going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare thats a nightmare.
So, Im sticking with you people.
Im going to spend money here.
I have a great team over here.
And I will tell you Im going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and its so important.
And you know, its about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory.
Okay?
Not like over the last  right?
So, I love you all.
I mean, were having fun.
But I love you all.
But I do mean it.
Im going to stay here.
Were going to work really hard.
When I heard the poll today, they said "What are you going to do?"
I said, "Im going to work harder in Iowa."
Im not leaving Iowa.
Im not leaving Iowa.
Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again.
That I can tell you.
Okay, lets do a couple of questions.
Right?
Come on.
You know, we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country.
Now, you look like youre doing pretty well in all fairness.
But still, we have 50 million.
We have 46 million people and theyre getting food stamps.
46 million.
Think of it.
You know, we talk about how well were doing.
So we have 50 million  almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and its got to end.
One of the problems  we dont have enough jobs in this country.
Its very simple.
You know, its so simple when you think about it.
Our jobs have been taken away.
And Ill tell you what else, middle income folks  their salaries havent gone up in 12 years.
People are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago.
And other things have gone up.
So theyre really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago.
But thats an amazing stat.
But people  one of the reasons they say Im doing so well because I let people know were going to bring jobs back.
Were going to bring industry and plants.
Were going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that.
Were going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and theyre working.
Then the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs.
I have some people that I know very well and theyve had a job for 20 years at the same place.
All of a sudden theyre working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better.
They love the owners, the stores and things.
They love the owners; they think the owners are great.
But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs.
They work all their life.
They have a wonderful company that theyre working for, and now all of a sudden theyre cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare.
And you all know what Im talking about.
So they end up being part-time workers and they dont want to be part-time workers.
They dont even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker.
And were not going to have that stuff anymore.
Were not going to have it any more.
Were going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up.
Believe me.
The numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and thats a shame


Tell you what, as President, I can guarantee it.
As Trump, I can say Ill probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it wont stop.
Itll be easier to take Todd and just say, "Look, were going to work with you, Todd.
Okay?"
So will you get me that number and everything and well make sure that everything get  and somebody else  who else over here?
You have problems with the VA also, huh?
Terrible?
I hear only  I just hear terrible.
And were going to solve that problem.
You know, it can be solved.
The waits now for the VA are longer than theyve ever beenThe waits now are worse than theyve ever been.
Thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor.
Okay, dying.
And you find the same thing, you say.
You have to use your own because they wont do anything.
So were going to take care of our vets and were going to take care of the VA and its going to be one of the things were going to be releasing pretty soon.
But one of the things were going to do with the VA, we have a lot of hospitals that arent doing any business.
We have a lot of private doctors that could do more business.
Were losing a lot of our doctors because of Obamacare.
Theyre retiring.
Theyre leaving.
One of them  a friend of mine  said "I have more nurses working for me now more than before but I have more accountants" and the end result is a disaster; hes getting out of the business.
Hes got nurses but hes got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy.
So one of the things were going to do is if Todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait  because the waits are unbelievable  5, 6, 7 days sometimes.
Theyre going to a private doctor.
Theyre going to go to a private hospital.
Or a public hospital thats in the area.
And were going to pay for that and its going to cost less money  its going to cost less money than the system we have now  and youre going to end up getting much better care.
Its going to cost less and youre going to get better care


So the Keystone Pipeline, first of all, Id approve it because its thousands of jobs.
Okay?
I would approve it so fast, so fast.
And Hillary should have approved it.
You know, Hillary wanted to approve it but shes been dragged so far left, thats shes  forget it.
Its a disaster.
So I would approve it.
But with that being said, I may want to make a better deal because you know what?
Were bringing oil from Canada.
Right?
I may say, I want 10%.
Were going to approve it but I want 10%, 15%.
Because the truth is that the Keystone Pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology, we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years, we have so much energy.
And its great stuff.
We have really great quality, higher than Canada.
You know, they have the tar sands, which is a problem for them.
Very expensive to get it out.
We have great stuff.
So I would approve it because I love the jobs of building it.
I love the jobs of building it.
But I may just say, maybe we should get 10%, 15%, maybe 20% as that oil flows through our land.
You know, maybe we should do that.
So Im going to look into that.
But when I approve it  Ill tell you what, when I approve it, itll be a great deal for the United States.
It wont be like  because right now, what were doing is were approving it, were not really getting anything.
Theyre putting it underground, and thats actually good environmentally.
Better than having trucks going down the road and everything else.
Thats good environmentally.
But were not getting  were not getting  anything much for it.
When I get finished with the Keystone, theyll be happy and well be happy.
Okay?
Well, Ill tell you in all fairness, Ben Carson said yesterday or the other day that he wants to abolish Medicare.
Okay?
And you know what a disaster that is.
Now, Im sure at some point, hell take it back.
But he said he wants to abolish Medicare and one thing, people do like their Medicare; they do like it.
And you are bringing up a point that Ive heard before.
Were going to look at a lot of different things.
But were going to save Social Security, were going to save Medicare and thats the way it is.
Okay?
Were not abolishing like other people.
Okay, its a lot of people but you know what?
Its costing us $200 billion a year immigration in this country right now.
And Dwight Eisenhower is going to say he moved 1.5 million in the 1950s, early 1950s, moved them out.
We have tremendous illegal immigration problems.
Dwight Eisenhower, nice guy, he moved 1.5 million people out of the United States.
And you know what happened?
He moved them right across the border and they came back and they moved them again and they came back.
They moved them a third time, they came right back.
And then you know they were tougher in those days.
They moved them all the way south  all the way south  and they didnt come back.
Now, we have to do it.
We have no choice.
We either have a country or we dont.
And I want them to come back.
But I want them to come back with papers.
I want them to come back legally.
I want them to come back.
The good ones.
The good ones.
But only the good ones.
We got some bad ones.
Remember the heat I took with illegal immigration?
Remember that heat?
For two weeks.
Rush Limbaugh said "He has received more incoming than any human being Ive ever seen."
And then he double-downed
You know what?
I took a lot of heat and then you had Kate in San Francisco, killed, shot in the back and so many others.
And people started looking.
And let me tell you, we have some wonderful people over here and theyre here illegally but theyre wonderful people.
Okay?
And well try to get them back real soon and well do it through a legal process.
But we also have some really bad gang members.
You know, some of the gangs in LA.
Theyre made up of illegal immigrants.
And we have unbelievable police forces that dont get the respect that they should get.
They dont get it.
I mean, what they go through, its unbelievable.
Theyre afraid to talk to anybody.
They dont want to lose their jobs.
They dont want to lose their pensions.
They cant talk.
Now, let me just tell you something.
You can always have bad apples.
In this room, we have a couple of bad apples.
Okay?
I dont know who they are or where they are but you do.
Probably mostly back there in the press.
But the police do an unbelievable job.
And they know the gangs.
You go to LA the LA cops.
You got Chicago, the Chicago cops.
These people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs.
But theyre not allowed to do their jobs.
And were going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and theyre not coming back and I dont want to put them in our jails because I dont want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years.
I dont want them in our jails.
We have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails.
I dont want them in our jails.
I heard a couple of these candidates saying, "Well, theyre  " Theyre such babies.
But you know what?
Theyre talking about putting them in jail.
Well, I dont want them.
Our jails are over-brimming.
I want to use our jails for people that are supposed to be there.
Okay?
And I dont want to put these really bad dudes  I mean, they are bad  I dont want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years.
Okay?
And were going to deal very humanely with the good people and they are mostly good people.
But weve got some real bad ones and theyre out of here.
Your head will spin probably.
Somebody said the other day, "Whats the first thing youre going to do?"
Well, were going to work immediately on repealing Obamacare.
You know, the one good thing about executive orders?
The one good thing?
You know, Obama signed an executive order where everybody just come in.
Come in.
We have great border patrol people.
I got to know them a couple of months ago when I went down to Texas to the border.
Theyre great people.
Theyre not allowed to do their job.
They stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them.
They want to do their job; theyre not allowed to.
So the executive order that President Obama signed, the one good thing about an executive order, in the first minute in office, I will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders.
Theyll be revoked.
The only good thing.
Its actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and thats the end of that.
So were going to clean up our border.
Were going to make it fantastic.
Were going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen.
We will support Israel 1,000%.
Israel feels so left alone and I know BiBi and a lot of my friends are from Israel and they feel so left out.
And so many people say, you know, I have so many Jewish friends where they say why did I support Obama?
I think hes the worst thing thats ever happened to Israel.
And we will support Israel beyond anything they ever have before.
Okay?
Thats an easy one.
Thats the easiest question of the night!
The wall is a big factor.
60%, 70%.
The drugs are a great question.
We are going to stop drugs.
Look, I told you before  Mexico  $45 to $50 billion.
Thats not including the drugs.
The drugs that are coming across the border are beyond belief.
Did you see the picture last week where they had a little wall this big and they built a ramp for trucks to go over it with trucks?
Did you see the picture?
They think were playing games.
And Mexico is not helping us.
Mexico is not helping.
Do you know if you want to become a citizen of Mexico  I love the Mexican people.
I have many Mexican people and Hispanics working for me.
In Nevada, Im number one.
Im rated number one in the polls with the Hispanics.
Everyones shocked.
Because the Hispanics that are here legally, those people they want me, they know Im going to bring jobs and everything else.
They dont want people pouring in.
But I will tell you Mexico has got to help us.
You know, if you want to become a citizen of Mexicodo you know its one of the hardest countries in the world to become a citizen of?
And yet, people pour right through into us, into us.
They call us the dumb Americans.
Thats what they call us because of our leaders.
They call us the dumb Americans.
If you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you could take the best person in this room, the most qualified, youre not going to do it.
They dont do that.
And if youre there illegally and if you overstay your bound?
Youre not going to be there illegally.
But if you have a pass for two weeks and you overstay your bound, they have cops waiting for you.
They have police that say, "You know you have one day left."
I hear its unbelievable.
Im impressed actually.
Because to a certain extent, thats the way its supposed to be.
But if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, its impossible.
They dont have anchor babies in Mexico.
Youre born a baby in Mexico, its like bye-bye.
Here, youre born over here, "Oh, congratulations were taking care of the baby for 85 years."
Not going to happen.
Its not going to happen.
No, its not going to happen.
By the way, this is important, I sort of lucked into this one.
The 14th Amendment.
It says right there  you know, everybody says you have to go through a whole process, itll take many years, you have to go through every state.
You have to do another amendment.
Its wrong.
14th Amendment covers it.
And some of the best legal minds in the world say "Trump is right."
I said, "What?
I am?
I didnt know."
I lucked into it.
Every once in a while you luck.
The fact is somebody comes in illegally and they have a baby, were not responsible.
Now, we may have a court case but were going to win it.
And a simple act of Congress gets rid of it.
And a lot of people didnt know that.
Okay?
And the reason I said it can be possible because nobody could be foolish enough to allow a thing like that.
How could it be possible?
And were one of the only countries where that takes place.
And honestly, I use Mexico as an example because theyre so tough.
If that happens in Mexico, they dont even know what youre talking about.
What are you talking about?
But with us?
No good.
Not going to happen anymore.
Well, you know, the amazing thing is that the politicians in this country live by a whole different standard when it comes to health care, when it comes to everything they have including what you just said about Social Security.
Our politicians live by a different standard and I think that shouldnt happen.
And some of them tried to do it.
You know the story in Obamacare, they dont have to take it.
They live by a different standard.
And thats not going to happen.
Everybodys going to live by the same standard.
Theyre going to have the same standard as the poorest person in this room.
Thats the way its going to be.
Its a good question.
But do you know if I answer that question, wed have a big, big story.
You know that, right?
You know, Ill tell you, it is a question thats asked a lot.
I know a lot of good people.
A couple of people on the stage that I really respect, Ive gotten to respect.
But the truth is too early.
I like to get things done first.
Weve got to close the deal.
I dont want to think about it.
There are a lot of good people.
There are a lot of good people.
Weve got to close the deal.
Weve got to get it done.
And to get it done, I want Iowa.
So good luck everybody.
Thank you very much.
I love you.
I love you.
Thank you.
And well be back.
Thank you.
So, were going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again.
Its a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again.
Too few Americans are working.
Too many jobs are being shipped overseas.
And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet.
This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business.
It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans.
There will be a major tax reduction.
It will simplify the tax code.
It will grow the American economy at a level it hasnt seen for decades.
And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit.
But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and weve got to make our economy strong.
Changes for individuals will be at levels that you havent seen in a long time.
Were going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4.
Simplification.
25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%.
If youre single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000  so, very important.
If youre single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, youll not pay any income tax  nothing.
This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty.
Very unfair penalty.
It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax.
It ends the death tax.
Its a double taxation.
A lot of families go through hell over the death tax.
It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich  in other words, its going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true  while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions.
Very importantly.
It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest.
Those are the hedge fund folks that Ive been talking about for quite a while.
They make a lot of money.
Carried interest.
So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital.
Changes for business  now, so important, because its all about business.
Its all about jobs.
We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they cant work.
So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.
Big reduction.
A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount  10%.
So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.
Now, its called corporate inversion.
Its a huge subject.
Ive been watching politicians now for years  all talk, no action politicians.
Ive been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back.
The number is probably $2.5 trillion.
Everybody agrees it should come back  Republicans, Democrats, everybody.
They cant make a deal.
They dont know how to go about making a deal.
The reason companies arent bringing it back is the tax is onerous.
It doesnt make sense to bring it back.
And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States.
Theyre leaving our shores to go and collect their money.
Theyre going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons  the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they cant bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in.
Its called leadership.
We will have that money brought back in.
As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas.
I cant bring it back into this country.
We filed papers.
Weve been doing this for a year and a half.
We cant get it back in.
So the money stays in other countries and thats what happens.
Not good for us.
The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important.
But this is something  and Ive been watching it for a long time  everybody agrees to.
We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes  many of them actually  and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income.
The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which dont make sense, and which are unfair are gone.
And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense.
So we are going to give you  we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex.
And were going to hand them out right now to the press.
And I think youll see we have an amazing code.
It will be simple.
It will be easy.
It will be fair.
Its graduated.
As you get up in income, you pay a little more.
Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer.
But I actually believe theyll do better because I think the economy will grow.
It will grow rapidly.
And well have something very special.
Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of whats going on in this country.
If you look at what were doing and the money were spending.
I read where a washer  you know what a washer is?
Nuts, bolts, and washer  to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there.
And there are many examples.
Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money.
We will run this country properly.
There is so much money to be saved.
Were reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country.
We wont be losing anything other than well be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be.
So, this is a plan thats simple, thats a major reduction.
I think people are going to be very happy.
Weve already had some very good reviews.
I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country.
They love it; they say "Why hasnt this been done before?"
And this is my wheelhouse.
Thats what I do well.
The economy is what I do well.
Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I wont say that.
So, if anybody has  [applause]  thank you.
Thats amazing.
Thats some of the press was actually clapping.
Ive never saw  I dont think Ive ever seen that before.
All right.
Why dont we take some questions from the press?
No, Im not going to do that yet but we have their approval.
But we have some of the top people in the country worked on this.
Well, were looking at a 3% but we think it can be 5%, it could even be 6%.
Were going to have growth that will be tremendous.
And by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular.
And one of the things that they dont take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting.
There is so much waste in government and I believe when I get in there Ill be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the  and were not even showing anything for that.
So, theyre very conservative numbers.
My taxes will  first of all, Ill have a much simpler tax statement.
It will be much simpler.
When I do my return, it will be much  my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous.
And you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else.
We want to simplify them to a tremendous level.
The bracket of 25%  the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all  theyve been there for years  are antiquated in many cases.
Or are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to Hillary, theyre contributing to Bush.
Theyre contributing to every candidate but Trump.
Because Im not taking any money.
Im self-funding.
And these people want these deductions.
There will be people  were reducing taxes.
But believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that wont be thrilled with this.
Were taking away deductions and thats one of the reasons were able to lower it.
This is actually a tax reduction.
A big tax reduction, including for the upper income.
I believe that the economy will do so well that even though they wont be getting certain deductions which arent fair for them to be getting that theyll end up doing better.
I just think this is a common sense approach.
You know, we could say supply side.
You could say theres 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases.
I dont think its supply side or anything else.
I think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal thats going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work.
Its going to create tremendous numbers of jobs.
One of the other things that Im coupling this with is if I become President, Im going to renegotiate our trade deals.
Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country.
Not sustainable.
We cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries.
Theres not a country that we negotiate with that doesnt make a better deal.
Everybody.
We lose money with everything.
Im also going to renegotiate some of our military costs.
Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world  Saudi Arabia  we protect everybody.
We protect everybody.
And we dont get reimbursement.
We lose on everything.
We lose on everything.
So, were going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals thats going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly.
Im not showing a big number in that.
But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive.
As an example, Saudi Arabia.
They make $1 billion a day.
We protect them.
So we need help.
Were losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion.
I used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now its $19 trillion and its only going up.
Well, no, look.
Senator [Marco] Rubio is a lightweight.
We understand that.
He wouldnt be able to do this.
He wouldnt know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is theyre trying to take  we just went up in the last poll.
We went up two points in the last poll, and we continue to go up.
In the NBC poll, I think we went from 26% to 29%.
Were going up very strongly in the polls.
They dont know what to do about it.
Ive built a great company.
Youll see that in 60 Minutes last night.
I built a great company.
Its a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow.
Im funding my own campaign.
Guys like Rubio, I mean, he desperately needs money.
Ask the car dealer in Florida.
Ask the people that support him.
And a guy like Rubio and others  I dont want to single him out; youre singling him out  but theyre largely controlled by their donors, the special interests, and frankly more than anybody else, the lobbyists.
Ive turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because its not the right thing.
Its just not right.
And that seems to be resonating very strongly.
I negotiate.
Its true.
I get bills from people; Ill negotiate.
Oh, is that a bad thing?
The country should do that.
Yeah, I would.
Id bring that same attitude to the White House.
Its true.
She says I have a habit when you get a bill, youd call up and you negotiate.
To me, thats a compliment.
No, I want to take that thinking to the White House.
I would bet you we could save 20% of our budget.
I could even save more.
But we could save a tremendous amount.
That has to be the attitude our country has.
You cant spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $2,000.
You know, when you look at costs, we just spent $1 million building a soccer field.
Okay?
A soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in Guantanamo.
Okay?
I dont like that.
What do you need $1 million for?
Level out the surface, let them play  if they had to play at all.
Okay?
What do you need to spend $1 million.
We just spent  its a story today.
$1 million on a soccer field.
How do you spend $1 million doing a soccer field?
You have a level piece of land.
Throw them a ball if they have to play soccer  if they have to play at all.
Why are they playing soccer is my question.
No, its too long.
You dont have time.
You dont have time.
No, not at all.
Were lowering taxes, which Republicans love.
And I think one of the reasons I am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons Im doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking.
No, were lowering taxes very substantially.
Were simplifying.
And were getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons.
So, no, thats not true.
Well, Putin was interviewed and I was interviewed last night.
I thought his interview  I though Charlie Rose did an excellent job.
But I thought his was a softer interview.
Scott Pelley interviewed me.
I thought Scott was terrific.
I mean, it was a tough interview but I thought he was very fair and I thought the piece was very good.
Why is he harder on me than Putin?
I would say because Putin is a nicer person than I am.
The worst in 36 years.
Well, its a good question and you can connect the dots.
But I guess it has been probably since 04.
You know, youre talking about 10, 11, 12 years that people have wanted to bring the money back into the country.
And again its called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and theyre going to other countries, taking jobs.
And now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies  very large, very prestigious companies as you know  obviously you know something about business.
But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States.
You know, it used to be theyd move from New York to Florida.
Theyd move from New Jersey to Texas.
Or whatever.
Now, theyre talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better.
And theyre doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons  one of the big reasons  as you know is taxes.
One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that theyve built up and they cant get back into our country.
And when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, its going to be put to work in our country, largely.
It can go other places.
But largely.
And I think it will be an amazing boon.
Now, heres the other thing.
They think its $2.5 trillion.
I think its much more than that.
I actually think its going to be more money than that.
And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.
Well, you know when you end the repatriation, when you get the money coming back in beyond, tremendous things happen.
Well, Ill be announcing that in the not too distant future.
But I will tell you.
Ive been honest.
Im the only one thats honest about this thing.
I watched Romney.
I watched all  "Oh, I pay so much tax.
I pay so much tax."
I watched all politicians and they say "I pay  "
I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.
Can I say that?
Im not a politician.
I fight like hell always because its an expense.
And you know, I feel  I fight.
I have the best lawyers and the best accountants and I fight.
And I pay.
But its an expense.
And frankly, I would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the drain.
Our country spends our money so stupidly and I will tell you that I could speak for myself I pay a lot of tax but I fight like hell to make it as low as possible.
But I would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that I respected the decisions.
All you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you dont feel so good about our country.
Ill tell you what in terms of income inequality, were going to create a lot of jobs.
You know, right now, we have a false  5.4%, 5.3%, 5.6%  every month its different.
Its such a phony number.
Because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, theyre taken off the roll.
So the number isnt reflective.
Ive seen numbers of 24%.
I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment.
42%.
And it could be because when youre looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it, you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you cant get the job  you know what Im talking about because youre shaking your head  and you cant get the job, essentially for statistically purposes you are considered employed.
So then I read every time it comes out I hear 5.3% unemployment.
That is the biggest joke there is in this country.
That number is so false.
And you know, people ask "How come Trump is doing so well?
And Carson and others?
How come theyre doing -?"
You know why theyre doing well?
Because people are tired of political speak.
Theyre tired of that.
And the worst example of it  one of the worst example of it  is the phony unemployment rate.
The unemployment rate is probably 20%.
But I will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you its 30%, 32%.
And the highest Ive heard so far is 42%.
Theres anger out there at the job picture.
Now, one of the things  with that being said, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, these countries are all taking our jobs like were a bunch of babies.
That will stop.
People will treat us fairly if I become President.
Were losing our jobs.
Were losing our base.
Were losing our manufacturing.
All of that will stop.
Well, this is number one a simplification.
Number two, what Im really doing is the big picture because corporations now are going to start having an incentive to create jobs.
Theyre going to have an incentive also to stay in this country.
Well, if they provide bigger dividends, people are going to have more money to spend.
So thats not so bad either.
If a corporation gives out a bigger dividend, thats great.
Mr. Jones gets a bigger dividend, hes going to have more money to spend in the economy.
So thats good.
I know nothing about that.
No, Im not a populist.
No, Im not.
Im a man of great common sense.
Im a man thats built a tremendous company with the best locations in real estate, the best everything.
Youre here at one of them.
I have many of these.
Ive done a great job.
Ive employed tens of thousands of people.
I employ now thousands and thousands of people.
Ive done a good job.
But I wouldnt say populist at all.
I would say Im a man of common sense.
Im cutting taxes.
Im going to create a lot of jobs.
Im going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste.
And Ill tell you what.
The waste that I get rid of  the waste that I get rid of  is going to have a huge impact and Im not even putting that in my numbers so I think its going to be terrific.
Yes, the motor industry.
Thats a beautiful way of describing it  the motor industry.
Where are you from?
England?
I love them.
Oh, what a beautiful accent.
No, I want to get the industry  we call it the automobile industry.
But I want to get the automobile industry to build factories here.
As you know, Ford is building $2.5 billion factory in Mexico.
Mexico also took a big plant out of Tennessee and Tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didnt.
I want the motor companies, as you would say, or the automobile companies to build their plants in the United States.
I dont want Nabisco leaving for Mexico or any place else.
I want these companies not to leave Chicago, not to leave Michigan, not to leave New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and all of these places where theyre leaving and theyre going to other countries.
I want them to stay here and they will stay here and theyll be so happy.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
Its been a great honor.
Thank you.
Autism has become an epidemic.
25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics.
Not even close.
It has gotten totally out of control.
I am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.
Because you take a baby in  and Ive seen it and Ive seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount.
But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump  I mean, it looks just like its meant for a horse not for a child.
And weve had so many instances  people that work for me just the other day  two years old, two and a half years old, a child  a beautiful child  went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.
I only say  Im in favor of vaccines.
Do them over a longer period of time.
Same amount but just in little sections.
And I think youre going to have  I think youre going to see a big impact on autism.
Boy, oh, boy.
I didnt expect that.
You know, Joe [Arends] and the group [Veterans for a Strong America] called and they said "Would you come over and speak?"
Im here for a certain reason.
You know, its called tomorrow night.
So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words.
An endorsement from your group with so many veterans  hundreds of thousands of veterans  I really appreciate that, Joe.
I did not expect that.
I didnt expect it.
I didnt ask for it.
I will say this: I am with the veterans 100%.
Theyre our greatest people.
Theyre being treated terribly.
Not only the number of deaths, which are obviously  thats whats going on is incredible.
But as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration.
You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days.
And its not going to happen.
Not going to happen.
If I win, believe me, its not going to happen.
And one of the things I thought Id do and Id stress so strongly  the veterans hospitals  obviously they have problems.
Theyre not properly run.
And when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say "Im sorry.
Im going on vacation", believe me, it doesnt get much worse than that.
So were going to create a whole new system.
Were going to take this system apart.
And if theyre not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and were going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals.
And youre going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it.
And thats going to be broken down into something thats going to be very special.
Right now  and you know it  we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans.
Its not going to happen anymore.
Its not going to happen.
So, Joe, I just really appreciate it.
So unexpected.
To be here is an honor.
They dont build ships like this anymore, folks.
You know?
We dont do them this way anymore.
I actually said what about recommissioning  look at this thing.
The largest guns in the world.
The most powerful guns.
I learned about the Iowa.
By the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons.
You know?
We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa.
Its been incredible.
Number one on the polls and we love those people.
Theyre great.
So this is a great ship and thats a great state.
I just want to say that were going to come out with some plans in a very short time.
Were going to be building up our military.
Were going to make our military so big and so strong and so great.
And it will be so powerful that I dont think were going to ever have to use it.
Nobodys going to mess with us.
That I can tell you.
And were going to have a President whos respected by Putin, whos respected by Iran.
You know, lets talk about for two seconds, lets talk about the Iran deal.
Now, Obama and his people call him the Supreme Leader of Iran.
Obama talks about the Supreme Leader.
Well, Im not calling him a Supreme Leader.
But he said the other day that after this rip-off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the United States again.
"Were finished with the United States."
Theyre taking $150 billion.
Theyre getting a deal thats going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think.
Theyre going to self-police  think about that one  they are going to go and self-police.
Theyve got the 24-day  they have 24-day provisions.
And by the way, what people dont understand  the 24-day provision doesnt start  you know this, right?
It doesnt start for a long time before you even get to it.
The clock is ticking.
It can take forever.
We may never get it there.
It is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts Ive ever seen of any kind.
So, we are going to do things and this country right.
Were not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and theres still there and we dont even ask for them.
One of them is there because hes a Christian.
We have a writer.
We have  the whole thing is absolutely insane.
You know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe  you know, Ive been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.
Right?
All right.
Ive been saying it.
But its possible  the world blew up around her.
It blew up.
Just blew up.
The whole world is like a different place.
Its possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that hes going to supersede.
And I understand that he may want to run for President.
He has no chance like she has no chance.
So were going to see what happens.
We have many problems in our country.
One of them is immigration.
Now, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President.
And for two weeks, I said  you know, Rush Limbaugh  hes a great guy  he said "He has suffered more incoming"  meaning the press  "than anybody Ive seen."
So what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that Im the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, its a big problem.
It is a big problem.
So you remember for about two weeks, I said, "Boy this is tougher than I thought running for President."
And then you found out theres tremendous crime.
Theres tremendous drugs pouring across the border.
Tremendous.
Beyond.
Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country.
So the drugs pour in and the money pours out.
Not a good deal.
We get the drugs, they get the money.
The drug cartels are going wild.
They cannot believe how stupid our government is.
They are making a fortune.
The drugs come in.
The money goes out daily.
And I saw it because I was on the border.
I was there.
And we saw it.
And everybody sees it everyday.
And we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership.
None.
None whatsoever.
So, were going to build a wall and Mexicos going to pay for the wall, believe me.
You know, a lot of politicians have said "Oh, theyre not going to pay".
They dont know anything about  they never read the Art of the Deal, first of all.
So heres the story.
So heres the story.
I said the other day to one of my people "What is the United States trade deficit with Mexico, Japan, and China?"
So lets start with China.
Almost $400 billion a year.
Now, if you have a company where youre losing $400 billion, youve got to do something very fast.
We dont.
Weve been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades.
Not going to happen anymore.
Not going to happen anymore.
With Japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right?
They drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars  millions of cars  and we sell them beef.
We sell them beef.
And they dont want it because their farmers dont want our beef.
They protest and they send it back.
All right?
Its not going to happen that way anymore.
Now, with Mexico  and I love Mexico.
I have many, many people  many, many people from Mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments.
Same with China.
I have so many people.
They pay me millions and millions.
What am I supposed to hate China because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment?
I dont think so.
I had the largest bank in the world as a tenant.
Its from China.
Bigger than any bank in this country by many times.
Theyre from China.
The problem that we have is that the leaders of Mexico, Japan, and China and every other country that we do business with, theyre smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders.
I love free trade.
The concept is great.
But you need smart people.
I have the smartest people in this country lined up.
I know the smartest.
I have Carl Icahn.
I have the best business leaders and they all want to do it.
Theyre wealthy because they make good deals like me.
I make good deals.
You know, its a talent.
Its a talent.
You cant be a politician.
Look, Im fighting some very nice people.
Very nice.
Even though Im leading in the polls.
But theyre very nice people.
But theyre never going to do anything with these countries.
Theyre never going to be able to do it.
Its an instinct.
Its something thats special.
They dont have it.
Believe me, they dont have it.
Its just going to be more of the same.
So, we are going to make our country so great.
We are going to make it strong.
We are going to make it powerful.
Were going to rebuild the military.
Were going to make it so strong.
We are going to take care of our veterans.
And in the end, in the end, I want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day.
The other week  two weeks ago in Mobile, Alabama, 31,000 people showed up in a rainy rough day.
31,000 people came to see us speak and were talking about making America great again.
Last night in Dallas at the American Airlines Center, 20,000 people  the basketball arena of the Mavericks.
20,000 people showed up and I want to tell you, it was a love fest.
Everybody  think of it, 20,000 people  there wasnt one heckler in the whole room.
I kept saying, "Theres got to be one."
There was a word  two words that used to be used a lot called "silent majority".
They stopped using them.
The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different.
I dont think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because theyre not silent.
People are not silent.
Theyre disgusted with our incompetent politicians.
Theyre disgusted with the people that are giving our country away.
Theyre disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job.
Theyre disgusted when theyre allowed people to just walk right in front of them and theyre standing there helpless and people just pour into the country.
Theyre disgusted when a woman whos nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years.
Theyre disgusted by whats happening to our country.
And youre going to look around and youre going to remember who the people are that are here because were doing something special.
This is a movement.
Were going to make our country great again.
Believe me, we will make our country great again.
I love you all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you all for being here.
This is some turnout.
My great honor.
The Chairman just left as you probably know and hes been extremely fair.
The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period.
And as you know, thats what Ive wanted.
I wanted fairness.
I dont have to be treated any differently than anybody else.
I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party.
Were leading in every single poll.
A new poll came out today where were over 30%.
Weve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%.
And frankly, Ive felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether its Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with whats happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up.
And for that reason, I have signed the pledge.
So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win.
We will win.
And most importantly, we will make our country great again because thats what its all about.
We have to make our country great again.
This is a self-funded campaign.
We have our heart in it.
We have our soul in it.
I dont need money and I dont want money.
And this is going to be a campaign like I think no other.
Im not controlled by lobbyists.
Im not controlled by anybody.
Im controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again.
Yeah, I got nothing.
I really got nothing.
The question was what did I get for signing the pledge?
Absolutely nothing.
Other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly.
And Ive seen that over the last two months.
They really have been very fair.
No, I have no intention of changing my mind.
Well, I think the big thing thats changed is  and its been obvious to all  number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship.
Nobody thought I was going to run and they said "Oh, he wont run and he wont put in his papers.
And he wouldnt do all of this."
I did that.
The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular.
Its a great company.
I built a great company.
And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received.
And I think the thing thats changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that Id be running for President.
So I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect.
So that was very important.
No, I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.
Well, you dont have to be met when youre at 2%.
Its one of those things.
Thats the way life works.
And I like Gov.
[Chris] Christie, by the way.
Well, the Chairman asked if he could come up.
You saw him.
He was here a little while ago.
And I was greatly honored that he did come up frankly.
Well, I think that when you get right down to it, were a nation that speaks English and I think that while were in this nation, we should be speaking English.
And thats how assimilation takes.
And thats how  I mean, whether people like it or not thats how we assimilate and thats how we go on to that next phase and that next stage.
And thats how people that dont speak  and Im not just talking about Spanish; Im talking about from various parts of the world  thats how they will become successful and do great.
So I think its more appropriate to be speaking English.
Well, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly its a country based on borders and our country is based on laws.
And when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that.
And this is not from South America.
This is not from Mexico.
This is from all over the world.
When people come illegally, we cannot allow that.
And I want people to come legally.
I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess.
Thats been proven.
And interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and Ive been proven right.
And many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate.
Of course, they havent done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will.
The fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders.
Were a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws.
And we will make sure that that takes place.
With that being said, I want people to come into our country legally.
I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door.
I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley.
I want engineers.
I want physicists.
I want people with great talent to come into the United States.
When people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford.
And immediately if youre not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country.
We want those people to stay.
We want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen.
I dont know enough about it to comment on it.
Was she jailed?
I really dont know much about it.
Thats absolutely false.
I win at golf.
I win at golf.
That I can tell you.
Well, I understand how the system works maybe better than anybody.
I understand the political system and I understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants.
Dont forget if I didnt bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldnt be asking the question.
Nobody would be even talking about immigration.
And immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor.
Now, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up.
But if I didnt bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that were talking about and it happens to be a very important subject.
I have to say this: It can also be a very positive subject because I believe so strongly in immigration and I just  we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner.
But if I didnt bring it up, nobody would be talking about it.
Well, there is gridlock in Congress right now and thats because theres no leadership at the top.
You have to be able to lead.
You have to be able to get people into your office.
You have to get people go to them.
Any way you want to do it.
But you have to be able to lead.
There is no leadership at the top.
Signing executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run.
I dont want to talk about that.
Its inappropriate.
Tom Brady?
Well, Tom Brady is a very good friend of mine.
Hes a great guy.
For those of you who dont know him, hes a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete.
He is really a very good friend of mine.
And I just spoke to him a little while ago.
Hes so thrilled and so happy.
Tom Brady  I think what theyve done is terrible.
And hes been exonerated as I understand it because I just heard about it.
But Im very happy for Tom.
As far as the Commissioner is concerned, theyre having a rough year.
Lets face it.
Theyre having a very rough year.
Well, in Europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming.
And its a huge humanitarian problem.
And I just say this.
This United States has tremendous problems of their own.
We have infrastructure that we have to fix.
We have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart.
Our nations in such trouble.
Thats why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder I think will greatly help.
But we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have  health care, which is a mess.
You know, if you look at Obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%.
People are saying "This is turning out to be a disaster."
Deductibles are through the roof.
The deductibles on Obamacare its through the roof.
So we have a lot of problems.
We have to take care of our vets.
We have to build up our military.
Just the other day, Gen. [Ray] Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness.
Now, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton  and Ive said shes the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.
Now, in all fairness, because of the agreement thats about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place.
I think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East.
Its going to lead to nuclear proliferation  the 24-day clause  everything about it.
We dont even get our prisoners back.
You say who negotiates a thing like that?
That wont happen, I can guarantee you, with a President Trump.
Youll see it later.
Yeah.
They dont want to hear it.
I would say very simply I just want to be treated like everybody else.
You see, I was always the fair hair boy.
I was a big contributor.
Nobody knows the system.
But I was on the other side.
And I was the elite.
I was the fair hair person.
Once I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider.
I became an outsider because I was running.
Because I wasnt supposed to run.
Im this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman.
But Im not supposed to be running for office.
The fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade.
And Im not knocking those countries.
Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders.
They are absolutely killing us.
China  taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base.
And think of this: We owe China $1.4 trillion and were paying them interest.
We owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount  $1.4 trillion.
Now, thats like a magic act.
They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money.
Thats not going to happen with me.
Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man.
Ill be honest.
I think hes a very nice person.
I think hes a very low energy person and I dont think thats what the country needs.
I hear hes going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me.
And honestly, look, hes getting the money from special interests.
Hes getting the money from lobbyists and his donors.
And theyre making him do it because hes crashing in the polls.
So I dont know whats going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads  I dont know.
I know that my life will continue.
I just dont know.
I mean nobodys ever spent money on ads against me.
But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way Ive done.
You know, one of the things Im most honored about is that so far everybody thats attacked me has gone down the tubes.
You have Lindsey Graham attacked me.
He was at 3%.
Now hes at zero.
You have Perry attacked me.
Now hes getting out of the race.
He was at 4% or 5%.
Now hes getting out of the race.
He was at zero.
Everybody  Rand Paul attacked me.
I see the last poll  the Monmouth poll that just came out today where Im leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me.
Now, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big.
So I dont know.
Are they going to spend  hes going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money.
Remember this  they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money.
Nobody knows the system better than me.
They have total control.
You understand it very well because youve been covering it for a long time.
Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate.
I will tell you this: Nobodys putting up millions of dollars for me.
Im putting up my own money.
In fact, I feel a little bit foolish.
People are offering me millions and millions of dollars.
You know, when youre in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down.
I feel like  am I a fool?
I feel very foolish.
And when I was in Iowa last week, I said "What do you think?
Can I take  " One man offered me  a big lobbyist  offered $5 million for my campaign.
I said to the crowd in Iowa  great crowd, 4,000 people  I said "Can I take it?
And would you believe Im not going to do anything?
I promise you.
I swear to you I wont do anything."
And they all stood up and said "No, no, dont take it."
The fact is Im the only self-funder.
Im putting up my own money.
I know there have been some super PACs  5 or 6 super PACs  where people are forming super PACs for Trump.
I have nothing to do with them.
As you know, youre not allowed to have anything to do with them.
So I dont know what theyre going to do.
Hopefully, if theyre going to do something its going to be nice.
But I dont know anything about them.
But just in a nutshell, Im funding my own campaign.
Nobody elses.
When people advertise  and I hope the voters can see this.
Every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests.
So just remember that.
Our country could be doing much better.
We have deficits that are enormous.
We have all bad trade agreements.
We have an Army that the heads said is not prepared.
We have a military that needs help and especially in these times.
We have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 Minutes they dont even work.
Okay?
If anybody saw that report.
The phones dont work.
Theyre 40 years old.
They have wires that are no good.
Nothing works.
Our country doesnt work.
Everybody wins except us.
We need victories in this country.
We dont have victories any more.
Our country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems.
I think its great that shes [Carly Fiorina] in the debate.
I was in favor of her being  I think she should be in the debate.
I dont like the fact that there are 11 people now as I understand it.
Theyre not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody.
But I think they should because theres too many people.
Because when you have 11, youre not getting to hear me and youre not getting to hear other people talking and I think thats too bad.
I think 11 is a lot of people.
But I was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate.
I think maybe hes [Joe Biden] inclined not to get in the race.
I think its going to depend on what happens with Hillary Clinton.
A lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate.
I dont know that to be true.
But I think it depends on what happens with her.
I think if she gets out, he will get in.
I think if she stays in, he might not.
Who knows?
Oh, hes not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and were very happy about that.
We dont want anything  and I told him.
I said, "I dont know if its appropriate Reince for you to be here because I dont want anything  " You know, you guys will end up saying hes endorsing Trump.
So I suggested frankly that Im fine with him not being here because I dont want anybody to think hes endorsing.
As far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and its a little bit sad.
Dont forget.
He was supposed to win.
And he just doesnt have the energy.
But what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists.
And I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not  if I were him, Id spend money on positive ads about himself.
Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe theyre at a point where theyre not going to leave because theyre fed up with whats happening in this country, but I think theyre going to go to people other than Jeb.
I dont know.
Right now, Im interested in jobs.
One thing  one of the groups, it was actually CNN.
I shouldnt say that.
But they did a very massive poll and I came out number one in leadership, number one on the economy, number one in jobs producing.
And I dont mean by number one.
I mean like number one by many, many times.
And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country.
You know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now.
93 million.
When they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats.
They take them off the statistics.
We have 93 million people.
We have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all.
Our country can be great again.
We have to put people back to work.
Would I bring my children into the administration?
I will tell you they are very capable.
The answer is probably not.
But having them in would be very good.
Theyre very, very capable children.
The second part I wont bother asking you.
Its no longer pertinent.
Kanye West?
You know what?
Ill never say bad about him.
You know why?
Because he loves Trump.
He loves Trump.
He goes around saying "Trump is my all-time hero."
He says it to everybody.
So, Kanye West  I love him.
Now, maybe in a few years Ill have to run against him.
I dont know.
So Ill take that back.
But hes been so nice to me.
You people have sort of seen because Ive been a counter-puncher.
I only hit people when they hit me.
Only.
And Kanye West has been so great.
I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me.
No, my supporters are really supporting me because Im very competent, because they know that Im not going to let China rip us off.
Im not going to let Japan rip us off.
Japan is devaluing their yen.
Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu  their big tractor maker  and others.
Were not going to let this happen anymore.
They do  you talk about a trade imbalance.
They have in Japan the biggest ships youve ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in.
Ive never seen anything like it.
We send them beef and they dont even want it.
Its going to end and theyre going to like us.
In this building, I have the largest bank in the world.
Right up these elevators.
Its a bank from China.
By far the biggest bank in the world.
I get along great with China.
I get along great with Japan.
I get along great with Mexico.
I love the people.
I love the people of Mexico.
I love the Hispanics.
I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me.
Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics  many from Mexico.
I have unbelievably great relationships.
And in the package that we gave you, youll see theres a poll and Im number one with Hispanics.
You saw that.
Number one with Hispanics.
So, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals.
Were going to be great to the vets.
Were going to be terrific.
Our military is going to be unbelievable.
All of these things  were going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something thats much better and much less expensive.
Were going to get rid of it.
Were going to repeal it.
Its going to be out.
Should have been out a long time ago.
Should have never happened.
But we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and were going to bring back wealth to the United States so we can afford to save Social Security, which Ill save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make America great again.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
And here is your pledge.
Im going to tell you a story about Nashville.
Youre not even going to believe it.
But its a very personal story.
Its a very special place to me for a very special reason.
But maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us.
Shes 92 years old.
We dont talk about age but shes 92.
And she looks magnificent.
And her name is Beada and shes become very famous.
You know who Beada is, right?
Beada, where are you Beada?
Look at her.
So beautiful.
So, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life.
She hasnt seen anybody that really did it to her.
And for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and shes going to vote for Trump.
I think, right?
Thank you, darling.
I really appreciate it.
You know, shes become so famous.
Shes on television all over the world now.
I have to be nervous even talking to her, youre so famous.
Its great.
Beada, thank you very much.
I really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it.
Because there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and were going to take this country back and were going to make this country so great again and so strong again.
Well, I just want to tell you about Nashville.
So, years ago  many years ago  like I hate to say 40 but I wont say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville.
Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco?
Genesco.
Right?
So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain.
And I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan.
And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good.
But the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany.
And thats what I wanted.
I wanted that piece of property so badly.
I shouldnt say that because youre not supposed to want things like that so badly.
God will get angry at me, right?
But I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee.
And I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually.
And they were having a lot of difficulties.
There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything.
And I convinced them to sell me the land and the building.
And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany.
I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower.
And to this day its one of the great buildings of the world and its one of the great successes.
And I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here.
And I just had such an incredible experience.
And when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places  you know, when youre leading in every poll, they sort of want you.
When youre not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they dont want you at all.
And well talk about the polls in a second.
But I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right?
But I decided lets do this.
And I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my  its not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal its so important and its been such a great  from the day I built it it was a home run.
And it all really took place because of Nashville, Tennessee.
So, I really  its an honor to be with you folks, I can tell you.
Real honor.
So, coming over I heard and I watched television  you know, they have all these cameras back there and theyre live.
And I guess were live on CNN, were live on so many different things.
Its always difficult.
You know, when youre always live, youve got to change up your speech.
You cant make the speech over and over
The other candidates dont get covered live ever, except for the debate.
So you know, they had 24 million people on the debate.
Now they think when the new numbers come out theyll be even substantially higher than that.
So I wouldve said they would have had a million or two.
So I say they have 24 million people.
And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN  that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity.
Does that make sense?
All to charity.
All to charity.
When I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story.
And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine.
So now  maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research  so many of this  theres so many good  Alzheimers  you know, theres so many things going on.
Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or Im not showing up.
You know, its interesting.
So theyll get 2 million  a million to 2 million people at the debates.
You know, theyve been doing them for a long time.
They dont do great, especially the early Republican debate.
Like you know the expression  it draws flies?
Thats what it draws.
So this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television.
I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television.
Naturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should.
I should.
So bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know.
But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that?
Maybe its not so nice.
So what do you think?
Should I do it or not?
Maybe not.
I dont know.
Heres the thing.
If I dont do it, CNN just makes a lot of money.
I dont care about CNN.
Honestly.
No, theyre going to make a lot of money.
They just shut off their camera.
Theyre actually very nice.
But theyre going to make a lot of money and, you know, its something we should consider.
So well all consider it together.
But coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children.
And these are people who come over to the country and theyre DREAMERs.
And I said, "What about our children?"
Why cant our children that are in the country, why cant they be the dreamers?
Nobody ever talks about that.
No, no, nobody ever talks about that.
You know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets.
You know, our vets are incredible.
No, no, the illegal immigrants in many casesare treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have  our wounded warriors are  these are the greatest people we have.
And another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, "Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
Nashville, its wonderful  " you know, is that I can sort of be very current.
Okay?
I can be very, very current.
I can talk about whats happening.
This morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in.
These are our veterans.
These are the people that got hurt fighting for us.
Maybe we wouldnt be here if it wasnt for them, to be honest with you.
I mean, thats possible too.
They had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where theres supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and theres nobody there.
And the veterans  I dont know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying "Where are the people?"
And then, they said, "What happened?"
And they said, "This happens all the time."
There was not even  nobody even there!
And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history  in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor.
When I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, Im like "Get me  " Id go crazy.
Its true.
Remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house?
Right?
Beada remembers that.
Youd have a cold.
The doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top.
And hed come over to your house, check you out, fine.
Those days dont exist anymore.
You know, were in age of Obamacare where nothing exists.
By the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare.
That I can tell you.
That I can tell you.
But, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration.
So that if you go to the doctors office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days.
One case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation.
Now, you think about that.
Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day?
But these people are waiting four, five days.
So the waits now the longest in history and thats the way were treating our greatest people and thats not right and were going to change that.
Were going to change that.
We have right now  and people dont know this.
You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically.
All talk, no action politicians.
And I mean on both sides in all fairness.
You know, Im a Republican.
Im a conservative.
But Im just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens  they become weak.
You know, they go to Washington  "Were going to stop Obamacare.
Were going to stop this.
Were going to do this.
Were going to do that."
Then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go "Oh, I made it, darling, I made it.
I vote for you.
I vote for you.
I vote for Obamacare expansions.
Ill do whatever you want me to do.
Im in Washington."
Its amazing.
Isnt it amazing?
Dont you agree?
I wont happen to me, I promise.
And if it does, you can let me know about it.
But it wont.
I promise.
I promise.
But you know, they show those phony statistics where were 5.4% unemployment.
5.4%.
The real number.
You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not.
But when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force.
93 million people.
Of the 93 many of these people want jobs.
And they quit looking.
So if youre looking for a job and you cant find it and you stop for a while  you know, after a while you sort of like "Its not happening.
Its not going to happen."
I dont know what they do.
But they stop.
They are considered statistically employed.
Okay?
So, we have 93 million people out of the labor force.
I mean, think about it.
Its hard to believe.
We have 50 million people in poverty.
These are very new numbers.
50 million people in poverty.
Taking our money.
Japans taking our money.
Mexico is beating us at the border and on trade.
By the way, theyre killing us on trade.
You know that.
In fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee.
Remember?
Recently front page Wall Street Journal.
A plant that you were going to have
[Comment on a supporters sign]
You know this is a movement, folks.
This is not like maybe even about me.
I dont want it to be about me.
This is about common sense.
Its about doing the right thing.
One of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing.
Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, were leading big.
Those are great people.
We just left Iowa.
We had such an amazing evening.
4,000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening.
We just left Alabama, which was unbelievable.
31,000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour.
And it did.
It poured the minute my speech  thats like luck.
Thats from God.
The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured.
We had 31,000 people and it was the most unbelievable.
And the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama.
Leading big in Iowa.
Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire.
Great people.
Leading really big in New Hampshire.
Leading big in Florida.
How about Florida?
I have a governor.
We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and were leading big in Florida.
How do you do that when you have a Senator whos sitting, you have a governor whos been there for eight years and Trump  ?
I love Florida and Im there a lot.
What could be in Florida?
Great weather.
You have great weather but Florida has great weather.
Big advantage.
But you know, Im leading big in Florida.
But one of the polls came out because in South Carolina and North Carolina, Im leading really big.
And in South Carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability  you know, Im the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say  I think I had one poll where Im 41%  almost 41%  can you imagine?
41%.
Theres 17 people.
So Im at 41% with 17 people and they said "Trumps at 41% but look"  you cant even hear it.
You know, "Trump says bleh".
Nobody knows what they just said.
"But there are some people that dont like him."
Its unbelievable.
Im the only one that wins these polls and I get negative publicity.
No, its incredible.
The press, ayeyayay.
Well, yesterday, you might have seen me.
I was in South Carolina.
I made a speech.
I had to bring it up.
The New York Times to me is a big deal.
You know, Im from New York.
Very liberal paper but thats okay.
You know, not everybody could be like us.
But its still the New York Times.
Right?
We have to admit, still the New York Times.
And Im on the front page a lot on the New York Times, and to be on the front page of the New York Times is a big deal.
But yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level Hispanic commentator.
Low level guy.
This one didnt like me.
By the way, I think Im going to win the Hispanic vote and I think  you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll.
They love me.
I love the Hispanic people.
Incredible energy.
Incredible people.
I love the people.
I have so many  I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me.
Theyre great people.
And I said, "Im going to win".
And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they dont want people coming in illegally.
You know its true.
Its true.
So theres this poll that comes out.
I think it was in South Carolina where were way up and Lindsey at 4% and hes the Senator.
Im at 30%.
So I wrote him a note, "Congratulations.
Im only beating you in your home state by 26 points."
So anyways, who cares.
But they did something that nobody reported.
They say, "Oh but do people like Trump?"
By the way, this election is not going to be like.
I think Im a nice person.
I love people.
I want to help people.
Womens health issues to me are very important.
To Jeb Bush it wasnt important because he didnt want to fund them.
And then he said, "Oh, I misspoke."
But you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person.
But I think its actually going to be an election based on competence.
Were tired of being like the patsy for everybody.
I really do.
I think its time.
But in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll.
Big poll.
Highly re  "In another act of political magicTrump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative"  nobody wrote this by the way.
Nobody said it.
Nobody reported it.
"From negative to positive."
This is an exact quote.
I have like this photographic memory so I dont need  but I want to be sure because if I used the word "the" incorrectly, theyll say, "He didnt  "
"Favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month".
A feat that Monmouth Universitys Patrick Murrays highly respected pollster called "astounding".
Called it "astounding."
Nobody else wrote about it.
"That defies any rule in presidential politics that Ive ever seen," said this highly respected man.
Murray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that hes never seen that before.
And you know what?
Thats because people have heard me and they say "Youre such a nice person."
No, they want  they say hes a man  Ive made a tremendous amount of money.
Ive had tremendous success.
And I dont say that braggingly.
Thats the kind of thinking we need in the country.
I mean, whatever it is.
But to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll.
We were much, much higher, more than double everybody.
And we are more than double everybody.
You saw the Quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll.
I was the same thing.
Much, much higher  double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates.
And the reason is people in this country are smart.
They dont believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people  you know, why are they doing this?
I mean, why are they even saying it?
Youd think that if somebodys good for the country  and Ill be great for the country because Im going to make great deals for our country.
We dont win anymore.
Our country doesnt win anymore.
Youd think somebody  even a liberal person or a Democrat liberal and I mean, really liberal.
Somebody whos going to make the country  why are they knocking it?
Why are they knocking?
Why do they fight?
Youd think theyd say "Lets do it.
Its good.
Its good for all of us."
Because our country is in trouble.
We owe now $19 trillion.
You know, Ive been saying $18 [trillion] for a while now.
But now it starts to go up quickly.
And by the way, when Obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in in 16, you want to see bad deficits?
You want to see it go up?
Youre going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs.
And its no good.
Have you noticed  and youve seen it yourself  the premiums have gone through the roof?
Right?
The deductibility  unless youre close to death, youre never going to use it.
You cant use it because the deductibility is so high.
But the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more.
Its a disaster.
And on top of that, its going to cost the country a fortune.
So its not only costing you a lot of money, its going to cost the country a fortune.
So we have to do something about it.
And we have to do something importantly about it.
But when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I wont mention names, some of them when they hear my name  I was talking  we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us.
Okay?
Who came down.
And she actually said "Some of them when they hear your name it looks like theyre a boiler waiting to explode."
Its true.
Now, number one, they look bad because they said  do you remember the beginning?
Like three, four months ago.
They said, "Hes a clown.
Hes a clown.
Just having fun."
You know, I went to a great school.
I did great.
I did  everything was great.
I came out.
I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune.
I then did a book called The Art of the Deal and many bestsellers.
The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time.
Who has read The Art of the Deal?
Yeah, most people.
Most everybody.
I jokingly say but I mean it  the Bible tops it by a long way.
I say that.
I say that.
Said it the first time in Iowa.
People liked that.
But its true.
Nothing tops the Bible.
But the Art of the Deal  great success.
Many books  bestsellers.
Many, many bestsellers.
Then I do The Apprentice.
Ive never done television.
I do The Apprentice.
Its one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way.
And NBC renewed the Apprentice.
You know that.
Right?
For me.
They came up to my office, the head of Comcast  great guy  I wont use names.
Just say "Steve".
No, honestly hes a great guy.
One of the best in the country.
He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, "Donald, were renewing The Apprentice.
Please, youll have to do  you have to do it."
I said, "Honestly, Steve, Im running for President.
I want to make our country great again.
I want to make -"
And they didnt believe me.
And I said it four times.
They didnt believe me.
Nobody believed that I was going to run.
Nobody.
My wife didnt even believe me, but now she does.
But she actually said "If you actually say youre going to run, youre going to do great because people like you."
She actually said "Theyd love you" but I dont want to brag.
But she said, "If you actually run  not you may run, you may not run, who knows?"
But she said "If you actually say -"
So the NBC guys come up  terrific people.
I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years.
We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great.
You know, last season you know how well it did.
So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows.
In fact, Mark Burnett called up.
You know Mark Burnett.
He did Survivor, Apprentice.
So Mark Burnett, whos a great guy, he calls up and he goes "I dont believe it.
Youre not taking a renewal."
The word is renewal.
I said, "Thats right, Mark.
Im going to run for President."
"No, no, no, you have to  nobody doesnt take a renewal.
Its unheard of in primetime television.
Two hours primetime.
Are you crazy?"
I said, "Mark, I have to do this.
Ive done so well in this country.
I have to do it."
We can save our country.
We can save our country.
So anyways, the bottom line, NBC renewed it.
I told them Im not doing it, and then they finally believed me when I actually announced.
They dont like me anymore.
Its amazing.
They do not like me.
But its too bad.
Too bad.
Well, thank you.
You know, the funny thing about The Apprentice  there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice.
Every single one of them failed.
So then a reporter said to me, "Why do you think that is?"
I said "Because Im special."
And I was kidding.
I was doing it sarcastically  I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right?
But I was sort of kidding.
And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing.
You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing.
But so I had a great experience.
So here I am  great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success.
When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said "It will never be successful" because you know to have a big hit  a really a number one hit  you have to  and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever.
The finale of The Apprentice?
Aye!
Remember with the great Bill Rancic.
Remember how that was?
Incredible.
But to have a great success, you have to have women.
And Ill never forget  I saved the article.
Right?
Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, "Truman loses" and he actually won.
Remember?
But I saved this article.
They said "Trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump?"
And I said, "Am I so bad?
Am I so bad?"
Tell me, am I so bad?
And it turned out that women were the biggest base.
I mean, those were the ones that likedSo you know I saved those things.
But no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible.
And honestly, its going to be hard.
Its going to be a lot of work.
Its going to be a lot of time.
I wouldnt leave the White House.
You know, Obama always leaves the White House.
Think of it.
Youre elected President.
Youre in the White House.
Why would you want to leave?
I think Id maybe never leave!
How cool is that?
He leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers.
Ill try  I dont know maybe theres some rules against it.
So maybe I cant.
But Ill do the fundraisers in the White House.
He and his wife left  I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California.
They left a couple of hours difference.
One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757.
Two planes.
A little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows.
And I say why?
Why arent they flying at least the same plane?
Now, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right?
So I know what it costs to operate these planesMore importantly, the time and the energy.
But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, "Lets do it from the White House."
This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I dont spend any money of the taxpayers.
And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better.
"Were doing our show live from the White House or something".
So we dont pay any money.
We dont have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you  do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things?
With hundreds and hundreds of security and youre closing down Burbank, California.
I mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say "Whats going on?
You cant move.
They closed down all the streets.
They closed down the city."
And he could do it from like Washington.
In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that Im buying which is only a couple of blocks.
Its true.
Im building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and its going to be incredible.
The Old Post Office.
And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe.
People say "Whats going on?
How did Trump get it?"
One of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it.
You know, theyre the ones that made the decision.
And I got it and were building this phenomenal hotel  Trump International Hotel  right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House.
Right?
Its going to open just in time  and by the way, listen to this one.
Were under budget and ahead of schedule.
Do you ever hear that from government?
Way under budget.
So were actually going to be opening and itll be great.
But he can use my hotel.
Ill let him use it free.
You just come in, use it, go back to the White House.
But you dont have to do that.
But youd say to yourself why  you know, its a mindset.
But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country.
You dont want to waste time.
Youve got to do this.
Youve got to make deals.
Ive got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us.
Carl Icahn  incredible guy.
Right?
Incredible guy.
Great deal maker.
Ive got some of the greatest deal makers in the world.
Theyre all calling me too.
They said "You didnt ask me."
I have these guys calling me up  the best in the world.
Now, I know the best.
I also know guys that are overrated.
I know guys that you havent heard of that honestly are phenomenal.
I know a lot that you have heard of that arent really that good, that are overrated in my opinion.
But theyre the best in the world.
And theyre calling me.
They dont want money.
Theyre worth billions of dollars.
But when I put, lets say, Carl Icahn and Ill say "Carl, do me a favor.
Handle China."
Were going to make a great deal.
No, no, were going to make a great deal because thats what happens.
You know, thats what happens.
So, were going to take back our trade.
If you look at China, if you look at Japan  I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago.
I saw ships  the biggest ships Ive ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice.
Everythings nice.
Except that it doesnt help us.
When does it help us?
When does it help us?
We sell them beef.
Beef.
And then they dont want it.
Because you know, do you ever see whats going on over there?
We sell the beef and it goes over there and its very perishable.
So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over "We dont want it."
They have cars coming from these massive, massive ships.
Massive.
And they just pour off the ships.
And I say, "What are we doing?
How stupid are we?
No tax, no nothing."
And Im a free trader.
I believe in free trade.
I have to say.
But I have to be fair trade.
When you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here.
We get nothing by comparison.
Its like peanuts.
Balance it out, fellows.
Balance it out.
Got to balance it.
A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
As you know, China has  its probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us.
Theyve taken our money.
Theyve taken our jobs.
Theyve taken everything.
Theyve taken so much.
And theyre creating a bubble and you know interestingly were so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might.
And weve got to be smart.
I made so much money dealing with China.
I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China.
The Bank of America building in San Francisco  I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows.
Nobody knows.
You know, all these guys come to Forbes.
"Oh, Trumps worth only $5 billion or $4 billion."
Or whatever.
"Hes only worth $5 billion."
Its like a bankrupt magazineThey dont even know my numbers.
They said, "Well, we havent been able to look at about 400 of his companies."
So I filed.
Interestingly, they said "Hell never run.
Hell never run."
Then I announced.
Then they said, "Oh, hell never file his form whatever."
Thats a single page where basically youre signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement.
I signed my form.
And they said, "Well, hell never ever put in his financials."
And you have like 90 days or something.
And they said, "Hell ask for extensions but hell never show because hes probably not as rich as people think."
But actually Im much richer and I put in my financials  its true.
Its true.
And Forbes and another group said, "No, no, we dont know what these companies are."
I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud.
I might have filed if I wasnt going to run.
I wanted to show people.
I wanted to brag.
Its such a great company Ive built.
So they said, "Hell never put in his financials."
I put in the financials.
And everybody  theyre much bigger.
Its a much bigger  you know, very little debt, tremendous value.
And really great assets.
Iconic assets.
You know, iconic.
Doral, Turnberry in Scotland.
I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world.
And Im very proud of it.
But they say, "Hell never file.
Hell never file."
Then they see all these companies.
And you know, they have boxes.
And because it wasnt really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes.
They say, "Is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?"
The last box is $50 million or more.
$50 million or more.
So like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that.
I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that.
So it says "$50 million or more".
So I checked many of them.
I dont know how many.
I think theres 23 of them.
Can you believe it?
So I checked like, I dont know, I think its 23.
I could be wrong.
Oh, theyll kill me if Im wrong.
But Im not sure.
But I think its like 23 boxes.
$50 million or more.
So you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you?
They added up 23 50s.
Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion.
Some of them are worth more than a billion.
So it says "$50 million or more", I go 50.
So theyll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more.
And they add them up and they say "Well, hes worth $2.9 billion."
Its really  this is the press.
And they have no clue.
Those statements arent really meant for me  its not meant for a guy like me.
But with all of that the statements were so good.
Theyre so good.
Theyre so good.
And you know, one of the things Im doing and last night was incredible.
We had an amazing event in Massachusetts.
Right?
Oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in Nashville?
What are you doing?
Anyway, so here I am.
I spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel.
Okay?
Like a lot of money on jets.
But somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing.
I didnt know who did it.
But somebody puts up a sign.
So all over the place, Im spending millions of dollars.
Im turning down millions.
I dont want your money.
I dont want your money.
Somebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didnt have to make.
But they put it up.
Its all over CNN.
"Trump is asking for $100."
I fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune.
The fuel.
The $100.
The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something.
The guy that had it is a great guy  Ernie.
A great guy.
Really successful guy.
You know him, right?
Ernie.
Hell sell you a car any day of the week, right?
And you know the guy is  like 2,000 people showed up.
Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell theyre serving.
So they put up a sign.
I dont want the money.
I might like $4 or $5 million.
Thats hard to turn down.
But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free.
And I end up with this big story  "Trump accepting contributions".
I cant believe it.
I got so angry at my people.
Because somebody put up a sign saying $100.
And honestly, first of all, its like peanuts.
It doesnt mean anything.
But they used to it to try and marginalize.
They always do.
They always do.
The bottom line is I am self-funding my campaign.
Im self-funding.
I dont want to have anybody giving.
I dont need money.
Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and its not a lot of money but its great money.
Like Beada might send me some money.
Beada will send me some money.
But a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia.
Another person sent me $12.
Small money.
And some sent me $1,000.
But it doesnt amount to a lot.
But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign.
How do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia?
"Dear So and So, Im sorry I dont really want your money."
How do you write a letter like that?
I want them to invest in it.
You know, but theyre not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million.
I had a big lobbyist asked me to have  he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign.
I turned him down.
I turned him down.
And then I see this story on CNN last night.
It was disgusting.
That look theres a sign  $100!
Somebody does a sign.
It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth.
It was so beautiful.
It was beautifully done.
And theyre doing this big thing about all day long last night about  I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize.
And thats the press.
Thats the media.
Yeah, the criminal media.
I mean, theres truth to it.
No, because a lot of times they know its wrong.
But I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event.
It had to be a record for a house.
The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent.
But we had 2,000 people.
It had to be a record.
The spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible.
The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa.
Dont forget.
When I went to Iowa and you know what I love?
Im leading with Tea Party.
Big.
I love Tea Party.
I love the Tea Party.
Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow.
You have not been treated fairly.
No, you havent been treated fairly.
You have not been treated fairly.
You know, people talk about the Tea Party and you talk about marginalizing, at least I have a microphone where I can fight back.
You people dont.
The Tea Party people are incredible people.
These are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media.
Its disgusting.
And you will be surprised how big you are.
You dont know how big you are.
You dont know the power that you have.
I mean it.
You dont know the power that you have.
The Tea Party and you can call it anything that you want.
I dont care about names.
But the Tea Party has tremendous power.
I talked silent majority.
But the silent majority is more than Tea Party.
Its Democrats.
Its poor people.
Its rich people.
Its everybody.
Its evangelicals.
One of the things that made me so happy  Im a protestant.
Im a presbyterian.
Right?
is that I had a recent poll and they did a beautiful  like these polls are great.
You know, guys like Jeb Bush and Hillary, they hire pollsters.
They pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars.
What do you have to do that for?
Every week they come out with a new poll.
Right?
Hey, Im rich.
I could hire a hundred poll.
I dont want to waste money.
You know, why should I pay?
I know in one caselike $150,000 a month.
And you know, then theyre arrogant guys.
They think theyre hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say.
"Youve got to say this.
Youve got to be politically correct."
No way.
I dont have time to be political.
No, its true.
Its true.
I dont have time to be political.
You know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct.
You saw the anchor baby thing.
Did you see that with where Im on?
And somebody fromits the same network  CNN again  he said, "You know the name anchor baby is very insulting?"
I said, "What would you call it?"
And he gave me like nine words.
"A baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that."
I said, "How can I say that?
Its too long."
Its anchor baby.
And then Bush  Jeb.
Jeb Bush gets caught because he is such a nice person.
Honestly.
If you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb.
The country is going to go to hell but we wont talk of that.
No, no, but if you want a nice person.
So Jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo.
You know, dont say this, dont say that.
All these things.
Pages of stuff.
But one of the things  "Never use the term anchor baby."
So all of a sudden, hes using the term anchor baby just last week.
And with me, when I use it nobody criticizes me.
They expect me.
They gave up.
Okay?
With him, they killed him.
They just killed him.
It didnt stop.
And then he blamed it on the Asians.
He said, you know  did you see that?
And then the New York Times did an editorial "How dare you attack the Asians?"
So he wanted to steer away from the Hispanics.
He said, "Well, you know, the Asians come in and they also have anchor babies."
And now the Asians all hate him.
Its true.
But the Asians love me and I love them.
I love them.
So he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says  a couple of years ago  "Dont use this term", and now hes using it because he has to.
Because baby  you know, think of it.
Think of it.
I want to build a wall.
Okay?
So easy.
So easy.
When this clown  Jose Reyes or whatever the hell his name  no, hes a baseball player.
Ramos.
Actually Jose Reyes is a baseball player.
Hes a nice baseball player.
But when Ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and I had all these reporters.
Actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming.
So I even had liberal people from CBS  I actually said to the CBS guy "Yes?"
and this guy stands up and starts screaming.
So when he  and I actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him.
I didnt do anything like  I didnt do anything.
Except for the Times.
And thats what I alluded to before.
The Times said, "Donald Trump railed at him and screamed at him."
I didnt scream at him.
But he was screaming at me.
And much worse than that, they said I wore a toupee.
Can you believe it?
I dont wear a toupee, and I proved it  I wont bring anybody up.
I wont bring anybody up.
But I dont.
But think of it.
Im in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer  this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of  saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee.
And I dont.
So, Im on the front page of the New York Times.
I cant even talk about it.
Im embarrassed to talk about it.
But they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million.
They didnt mention that.
They also didnt mention that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton.
Did you know that?
His daughter works for Hillary Clinton.
Oh, you didnt know that.
Oh.
No, they didnt mention that.
No, no.
They said I was wearing a toupee and I was screaming but they didnt.
No, hes screaming at me.
So we very nicely  and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk.
He actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit.
You know, hes a very emotional man.
But, he said, "You cant build a wall because you cant do it."
So, 2,000 years ago in China  we always get back to China  2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China  oh, wed like to have a wall.
This is a serious wall.
Okay?
This is a wall you dont go through so easy.
They built a wall 2,000 years ago thats 13,000 miles.
Think of that.
Thats a big wall.
Thats serious wall, right?
This was 2,000 years ago.
I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit  you know, took a long time.
But 13,000 miles thats a long time.
They had no tractors.
They didnt have Caterpillars.
Of course, today, we use Komatsus because theyre made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper.
How stupid is that?
Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars.
Caterpillars stock is down.
Its terrible.
Well change that around.
Believe me.
Believe me.
But, they build this wall.
Now, we have really 15  I would say  look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to 13,000.
But you dont need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places.
And actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built.
Hillary wanted it built.
But they couldnt.
Because Im a great builder.
What I do best is build.
Im not a rendering guy.
I do the building and then do the rendering.
A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built.
Does that make sense to anybody?
Im the opposite.
I get it built.
So, one of the reasons it couldnt get built is because they couldnt get an approved environmental impact study.
Do you believe this?
No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things.
They couldnt get it.
They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall.
And theyre killing people.
We have illegal immigrants.
You see that with Kate in San Francisco.
You see it with Jamiel.
You see it with so many people.
Last night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants.
They come into this country and kill members of their family.
Last week in California, a 66-year-old veteran  a female, a veteran, 66  got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed.
Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed.
66-years-old.
By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily.
But this is what we have.
We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border.
And you know what?
We have great border patrol people.
I went there.
You probably saw that.
Thats why the hat is so successful.
The white one, right?
But I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat.
Now they like the white one.
Then two weeks later, I wore the red one.
The white one didnt sell so well.
The red one sells.
Crazy thing.
But I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know its rough stuff, its rough stuff.
And when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration.
I was killed by the press.
Rush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said "Trump has received more incoming than any human being Ive ever seen.
Then he goes and has a news conference and I think hes going to apologize and he doubles down."
I got credit.
I got credit.
No, they thought I was going to apologize.
And I dont mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right.
No, I was right.
So for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incomingIn fact that was my first two weeks.
I said "Is it going to be like this for the next year and a half?"
I dont know if I can make it.
It was brutal.
Now, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, theyve apologized to me.
Everybody says Im right.
And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration.
They wouldnt even be talking about it.
They wouldnt even be talking about it.
And were going to build a wall and were going to get, you know, the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes.
Theyre going to be out so fast.
One of the first thing Im going to do is get rid of those gang members.
Were going to be  you know, you look at whats going on with Baltimore, you look at whats going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night.
We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin.
You know, we can be very tough.
I just met your cops outside.
Those police are tough cookies.
Those guys  we need law and order.
We need law and order.
I mean, they allowed  in one night, that first night in Baltimore  they allowed that city to be destroyed.
And they set it back 35 years.
One night.
Because the police were not allowed to protect people.
They werent allowed to protect people.
We have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be  the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know.
Originally from New York.
Hes a phenomenal guy.
He can stop things if theyre allowed to stop them.
He can stop it.
Believe me.
We have some incredible people.
But we have to be tough.
We have to be smart.
You know, I know youre going to have some bad apples.
Youre going to have problems.
I see some of the things.
You did too and its disgusting and its horrible.
But thats such a tiny percentage.
The problem is the good work doesnt get shown on television.
All of the good work, which is 99.9%.
I mean, the good work with the police.
Its 99.9%.
That one little thing.
And its horrible.
I agree.
I hated some of the things.
I dont have to go into them.
But you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like I was.
But we need law and order.
We need our police.
Theyre great people.
They do a phenomenal job.
Theyre right now afraid of doing anything.
Theyre afraid.
I mean, I know cities.
I wont mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they dont want to be thrown off the police force.
And then you wonder why theres crimes in our cities.
So we need a whole new mindset.
We have to build up our military.
We have to make our military so strong.
We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it.
We never have to use it.
We also have to focus on what we have  look, Ukraine.
I want Ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good.
But Ukraine is near Germany and all of these European countries.
Were now sending F-22s.
Thats the newest fighters.
The best in the world.
Were sending fighters every  Wheres Germany?
Where are all these European countries?
It affects them.
It affects them.
And we want to stand alongside of them.
I agree.
But why are we leading the fight?
Putin hates us.
He hates Obama.
He doesnt hate us.
I think hed like me.
Id get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth.
No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesnt like him in all fairness.
They dont have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say.
But Id get along with these people.
Think of it.
Every country is ripping us off.
Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because theyre going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran.
Think of that.
So one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia.
Okay?
But think of it.
So, Ukraine  lets take a few of these things and then Im getting the hell out of here; Im going back to New York.
Do you mind?
Maybe Ill go to the Grand Ole Opry tonight.
Can I do that?
Id actually rather  I love  by the way, this is not a politician speaking.
Believe me.
I hope.
I love country music.
I love it.
Hey, Trace Adkins  right?
And who else won on The Apprentice?
Who else?
John Rich.
My kids love those two guys.
John Rich.
And who else?
Who did really well?
Clint Black.
Right?
Clint Black.
He did great.
And my Trace  how good is Trace, okay?
You know, Trace came onto The Apprentice.
And I said, "Who the hell is he?
Who is he?"
I didnt know who Trace was.
Id never heard of him.
And he wasnt a big name.
And he came on  just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it nowit went to number one.
And then he came to me the next yearbut Trace came to me and he goes  you know, at certain awards show, I wont mention the name  but he said "Last year, I couldnt get into the show and this year Im hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you."
Nice, right?
I know, nice.
But those three guys, theyre great and theyre just fantastic people.
But weve got to make our country so strong.
We have to make our country rich again.
A person came up and said, "Oh, thats not nice."
Whats not nice?
They said rich, you know, to say were going to make our country rich.
We cant make our country great if were going to be poor.
Were a debtor nation.
We owe $19 trillion.
China  think of this  China we owe $1.4 trillion to.
So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1.4 trillion.
How do you do that?
Thats like a magic act.
Right?
Its true.
Japan sells us cars by the millions.
They make a fortune.
They come in, they sell us cars by the millions.
And we owe them the exact same amount.
We owe them $1.4 trillion.
How come if theyre selling us cars we owe them money?
Think of it.
Put on your business.
See?
I have a natural instinct for this stuff.
Right?
You know?
Right?
If we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money?
But we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds.
And were paying interests on them and we owe them money.
So, itll change.
It can change.
Its not even going to be hard.
People dont realize.
See, Obama never read the Art of the Deal.
People dont realize.
Oh, and somebody said Sharon.
It was Sharon.
Wheres Sharon?
She gave me such a hard time.
Wheres Sharon?
Where the hell is she?
You could have both Sharons stand up actually.
Where are they?
Both of them.
Sharon is great.
Oh, did they go after herShe took a lot of incoming.
Sharon, did you take a lot of incoming?
I think so.
Right?
Thank you, darling.
So, we are going to do something that if I get elected  and again they said Ill never run and nowOne guy said  John McLaughlin  you ever watch the McLaughlin Report?
I like him.
And one of the people on the little group said Donald Trump is a great businessman but hell never make it as a President.
Hell never get elected.
Hell never make it.
And John McLaughlin  this crusty guy who I like; I dont know him.
I never met him, I dont think.
But I like.
Hes sitting there and he goes  and he got angry  he goes "Why wouldnt he make it?
You tell me why.
Hes been a tremendous success in everything hes done.
I go all over the world.
I see him name.
I see his name all over.
Hes a great success."
And he said  I think this is the word  "Hes a man of great achievement.
Why wouldnt he make it?"
And I thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up.
You know, because you need somebody of great achievement.
You need  Ive produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year.
I dont have to worry about Obamacare.
I take such good care of my employees.
I have thousands of employees.
I take good care of them.
We have great plans.
My employees are lucky.
They hit the lotto, okay?
But I take great care  education and health care  and my people are very happy.
But Ive done this for a long time, and Ive seen ups and downs.
Ive seen market crashes.
Ive seen friends of mine go bankrupt.
Youve never seen  Ive never gone bankrupt.
By the way, Ive used the laws to my advantage and companies.
I buy a company.
I throw it into a chapter.
I negotiate with banks.
I kill.
You know.
And then they say "Trump goes bankrupt."
These people  they dont have any 


Now, when other people do that, when a Carl does it  I mean, they do it all the time.
They use it all the time.
Its called using your head.
Its called using the laws.
Actually I did a good job didnt I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said  I do what every other great businessman does.
I buy a company  you know, its one company was sort of interesting.
A friend of mine had it.
Good guy.
And the banks were just killing him.
They were mean.
And banks can be mean, right?
Youve got to teach them how to behave, right?
So this guy was just getting beaten.
And I did him a favor and I called up the banks.
And I said "Do me this, do this, do this, do that."
They said, "We wont do that.
No, we wont do that."
I said, "Youre making a mistake."
Anyways, its sort of a little bit complicatedI bought it.
Immediately, I called them back and said, "Dont do this."
I threw it into a chapter.
And they come out with the story "Trump files bankruptcy".
Can you believe it?
I negotiated it to hell.
What I did to that bank  ayeyeye.
They see me walking down the street and they go "Hey, hey, hey."
But then Im good at that stuff, you know?
Im really good at that stuff.
But you have to use the laws to your advantage.
No, no, you have to use it to your advantage.
Atlantic City.
You know, you look at Atlantic City.
Caesars went bankrupt.
Whoever heard of Caesars?
Caesars filed Chapter 11.
Nobody cares.
Everybody in Atlantic City.
I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things.
I said, "Dont go into Iraq" even though Im a very militaristic person.
I said "Dont go into Iraq" and they shouldnt have because I said youre going to destabilize the Middle East.
So what did we get  $2 trillion.
Thousands of deaths.
Thousands.
Like 5,000.
Wounded warriors who I love all over the place.
We cant even go there.
Iran is taking over Iraq.
With the money that were giving them, theyre going to take off and theyre going to get the oil, theyre going to get everything.
The oil they dont get ISIS is getting.
What do we get?
Nothing.
We get nothing.
We got far less than nothing.
So I had vision in 2004  Reuters  actually it was before that but they wrote a story.
Trump says dont do Iraq.
Now, Im much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother.
But you got to know where to use it and when.
You got to use.
So with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out.
Thats called vision.
I should get credit for vision.
And again, this isnt bragging.
Normally, I wouldnt say this but I need your fricking votes.
Do you understand that?
Do you understand that?
I mean, normally I wouldnt.
So I got great credit.
I got out.
But most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or theyre bankrupt.
They went bankrupt.
But I made a lot of money in Atlantic City.
I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer.
I thought.
So I think I solved it.
Listen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win.
We are going to have victories again.
We are going to win.
In fact, last night in front of the audience and Ive never said this before.
Last night in front of the audience I said were going to have so many victories.
And then I said were going to win here.
Were going to win on trade.
Were going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobodys going to play with us.
Nobodys going to mess with us.
Okay?
Nobody.
And were going to have victories.
So many victories that are going to be coming outIn fact, you might get tired of victories.
You may not want anymoreAnd everyone stood up and said "No, no, no, we want to keep winning."
If I win, we will have victories all over.
We will win on trade.
We will win on health care.
We will win on everything.
I will protect your Social Security without cuts.
I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid.
We are going to have something thats so special.
And you know, my whole fame is and Ill say it once.
We will make America truly great again.
And thank you very much.
Thank you everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you very much!
Thank you, everybody.
Great honor.
Great honor, thank you.
This is a wonderful day.
On a Saturday morning yet.
Isn't that nice?
Thank you, all.
And we're going to have an incredible convention.
It's really going well.
We're going to have an incredible convention.
And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.
So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system  we are in a rigged, rigged system  and to make America safe again and to make America great again.
I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France.
We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look.
And now it's happening more and more.
And it's never going to stop.
We need new leadership.
We need new thinking.
We need strength.
We need in our country law and order.
And if I'm elected president, that will happen.
I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.
And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people.
We wish them well.
It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well.
A lot  a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out.
Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years.
The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before.
Never been like this.
Out of control.
After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Iraq, Syria, all into chaos.
And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons.
And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end.
Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton.
You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.
We also need to bring back in this country  because we see what happened  our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs.
They've been taken away, like we're babies.
Taken away.
And we're going to bring them back.
I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous  really prosperous society for all Americans.
Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice.
I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana.
And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.
But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you.
He is a solid, solid person.
Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress.
He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference.
Number one.
He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration.
It's horrible out there.
High taxes and regulations.
And it's out of control.
Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty.
We know that.
Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption.
She's a corrupt person.
What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads.
She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent.
She's crooked Hillary.
And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails  but it wasn't a loss, she discarded  that in itself is a major crime.
Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.
Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK?
Didn't give them to the FBI?
Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK?
Wipes her server clean, that's OK?
These are crimes.
These are crimes.
And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't.
But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around.
She's going to pay it at the polls.
I believe that.
On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time.
She's totally owned by Wall Street.
We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism.
And it's not that she believes in it.
The people that give her all of this money believe in it.
And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe.
Believe me.
That's it.
What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.
Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam.
Radical Islamic terrorism.
You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window.
You heard what he was screaming out the window.
You saw it in San Bernardino.
You saw it at the World Trade Center.
You saw it in Orlando.
How horrible was that?
You saw it in Paris.
You see it all over.
And Hillary is a weak person.
We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party.
We're going to change things around.
There's going to be respect again for law and order.
Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS.
You know, she's talking  I see the ads she puts on.
If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests.
Got a lot of money.
But I see the ads on foreign policy.
She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience.
Of course not.
I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson.
I mean  but  but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq.
Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson.
I was a civilian.
Take the oil.
Many, many calls I've made.
You take a look.
I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen.
I was the one that predicted it.
And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong.
President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win.
I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do.
And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.
And I said that Brexit's going to happen.
I said that they are going to break away.
And everybody laughed at me.
And the odds were 20 percent.
And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen.
And some of the more fair reporters  about 30 percent of them  said he was right.
I appreciate that.
Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK.
So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy.
So important.
Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike  and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest.
So many people have said party unity.
Because I'm an outsider.
I want to be an outsider.
I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides.
I won in landslides.
This wasn't close.
This wasn't close.
Now, this wasn't close.
This was  in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three.
There were 17.
We got  I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger  I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger  we got almost 14 million votes.
That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.
Think of it.
That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love.
That's more than Richard Nixon.
It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower.
You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness.
Pretty good.
It's more than the Bushes.
But I mean by a lot.
I don't mean by a little.
But that's with 17 people.
People don't over-say that.
That means our message is unbelievable.
And I want to thank all of the loyal people  because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.
But they displayed it.
It was on display, where we had this group of people, who  many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK?
Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump.
Oh, we're going to win.
They got crushed.
And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.
They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start  and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers.
We're going to put them back to work.
So they're very tired of it.
But I want to thank all of those people that  delegates that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something.
Did we show them something.
And unfortunately, the vote was very late.
But essentially, we had 112- 12.
This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight.
We're not going to have a fight.
People agree with what we've  they want the wall.
They want the borders.
They want these things to happen.
And what we're doing...
And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud  and nobody else would even think about doing it  I fought very hard for it.
We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals  and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination.
The evangelicals have been unbelievable.
I dominated with the evangelicals.
A lot of people were surprised.
They say he's not perfect.
But you know what?
They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart.
And I said  and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do.
You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group.
And he was a powerful president.
He knew how to get things done.
He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him.
But he was a powerful president.
And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status.
We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment.
And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.
I saw this.
I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top  the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders  people are going to be surprised to hear that  I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?
And they didn't know how to answer the question.
And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out.
One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues.
We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.
And I looked out the window.
I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street.
I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't.
That means they're more powerful than you are.
We have to do something about it.
How did it start?
How did it start?
And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson.
And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader.
And he did this, and he got it done.
And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people, and not because they backed me in such large numbers, but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away.
And we're going to change that.
OK?
All right.
Back to Mike Pence.
So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big.
Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall.
That's where Trump was going to  they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places.
But Indiana was going to be the firewall.
So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before.
NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton.
NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country.
Manufacturing down in some states 55 percent, 60 percent.
It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.
I have a friend who's a great builder.
What he builds is plants.
That's all he does, is build plants.
He doesn't build buildings.
He doesn't  he builds plants.
It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear.
I said, how's business?
I was with him the other day.
How's business?
He goes unbelievable.
I said, really, wow, I'm surprised.
Why is it unbelievable?
Because I think of him as building in this country.
He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe.
I said, what do you mean?
He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen.
I said, what about this country?
Not much.
Not much.
That's the expression.
He said exactly that.
Not much.
I said, but Mexico?
He said, you've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
Folks, that's going to stop.
We're going to go reverse it.
We're going to bring our jobs back to this country.
We can't be the stupid people anymore.
OK?
And he was better than a pollster.
He's better than a consultant.
I would say, how are we doing?
And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars.
Doesn't cost me millions.
Me, I give them $10,000, OK?
It costs other people millions.
It costs other campaigns millions to get a report.
Every time they get a report, it's millions.
But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report.
And he said it.
He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it.
Just fact.
How are we doing?
Unbelievable in Mexico.
In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.
And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan.
We want them to build them in Michigan.
They're going to build them in Michigan.
And you know that I know how to do that.
So easy.
So easy.
But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution.
There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here.
There are consequences.
And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country.
It's very simple.
And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike.
Indiana's unemployment rate  and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family  Karen is amazing.
Incredible family.
Highly respected.
Expected to go for another four years.
He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana.
Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen, when he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016.
Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs.
You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states.
I've gone to all of them.
And every time, I have statisticians.
I say give me the stats on a state.
And it's always bad, down, down, down.
Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases.
Here's somebody where it's gone up.
Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013.
That's like very unusual.
Governor Pence balanced the budget.
Can you imagine a balanced budget?
Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing.
We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion.
He balanced the budget.
They don't know what that means.
Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.
It's also rated AAA, their bonds are rated AAA.
Very few states have that.
AAA.
The best.
That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, AAA.
Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business.
Number one.
And it's not even close.
There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office.
So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.
And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me.
I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight.
But he agrees with everything I'm saying.
He loves the governor.
Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind.
If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said really  they're doing much better, the V.A.
is much better.
They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for.
People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors.
People are dying on  they can't even see a doctor.
It's a scandal.
Take a look at what's happening with the V.A.
in Arizona.
Take a look at what's happening with  you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals.
It's a scandal.
It's corrupt.
It's incompetent.
It's a scandal.
And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine.
And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans.
I mean, we know that for a fact.
So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans.
In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent.
It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best.
Got them jobs.
Got them jobs.
Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates.
That's a great thing.
They're going to stay there.
That's a great thing.
And Mike worked hard on that.
He was telling me, that was not easy.
Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K- 12 education funding increase in the state's history.
So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education.
Isn't that a great thing?
Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America.
School choice is where it's at, folks.
You want to get your schools better, you better get rid of Common Core fast.
Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history.
Think of that.
We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets.
And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country.
CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.
So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up.
That had so much  look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump.
I build infrastructure.
Do I know how to build a wall?
Do I know how to build infrastructure?
You know, it's very interesting.
We're building  we're building  I won the  which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing  probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services.
And I really like what's happened.
We're going to have an opening very soon.
Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.
But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year  actually more than a year  we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially.
And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do.
And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before.
They've never heard them.
So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work  also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke  who's now at Purdue  when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened  almost has not happened in this whole country.
The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there.
And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide.
And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember.
He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted  who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy  but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump.
I said, who did he endorse?
So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non- endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK?
I will tell you.
So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
7/12/2016
WOW.
WOW!
[ CHEERING ] WHOA!
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TURN THAT MUSIC DOWN.
WE WANT TO GET TO BUSINESS, RIGHT?
GET TO BUSINESS.
HOW IS YOUR GOVERNOR DOING, BY THE WAY?
GOOD?
I THINK SO.
I THINK SO.
I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA.
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A GREAT VICTORY HERE NOT SO LONG AGO.
AND INDIANA WAS THE STATE THAT PUT ME OVER THE TOP.
THANK YOU, FOLKS.
THANK YOU.
[ CHEERING ] WELL, WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DISCUSS, BUT WE HAD SOME VERY BAD NEWS A FEW DAYS AGO, AND YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.
A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
AND I WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH A WHOLE LITANY OF THAT, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO.
WE WANT TO BE UPBEAT.
WE WANT TO BE POSITIVE.
WE WANT TO BE STRONG.
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG.
WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK.
WE'RE GOING BRING OUR MILITARY BACK.
IT'S BEING DEPLETED SO BADLY.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS, WHICH WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.
WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE, WHICH IS A DISASTER.
[ CHEERING ] AND REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING TERRIFIC.
WE END COMMON CORE.
WE BRING OUR EDUCATION BACK TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS LOCAL COMMUNITY WHERE THE PEOPLE LOVE THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN BE WELL EDUCATED.
IT'S SO IMPORTANT.
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.
AND IT'S UNDER SIEGE.
YOU KNOW, I WROTE A FEW WORDS TODAY.
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GO THROUGH IT AS A GROUP.
IT'S BEEN A SPECIAL PLACE AND YOU'RE SPECIAL PEOPLE.
AND I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE TONIGHT IN THE AUDIENCE.
AND YOU'RE ALL OVER.
LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS UP THERE, FOLKS.
LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS.
THEY DON'T STOP.
THEY DON'T STOP.
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY I WROTE THIS QUICKLY, BUT IT MEANS IT CAME RIGHT FROM THE HEART.
AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT OUR WHOLE NATION GRIEVES AND MOURNS FOR THE LOSS OF FIVE HEROS IN DALLAS, LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THESE WERE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.
GREAT PEOPLE.
[ APPLAUSE ] WE PRAY FOR THEIR FAMILIES.
WE PRAY FOR THEIR LOVED ONES.
WE PRAY FOR ALL THE WOUNDED SURVIVORS.
WE PRAY FOR OUR COUNTRY.
IT'S SO IMPORTANT.
THE POLICE ARE NOT JUST PART OF OUR SOCIETY.
OUR POLICE ARE THE BEST OF OUR SOCIETY.
REMEMBER THAT.
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.
THEY REPRESENT OUR HIGHEST IDEALS, OUR GREATEST VALUES, AND OUR MOST NOBLE CHARACTERISTICS.
WHEN OUR POLICE ARE ATTACKED, OUR ENTIRE NATION IS ATTACKED.
REMEMBER THAT.
REMEMBER THAT.
SO THE MESSAGE MUST BE DELIVERED CLEARLY FOR ALL TO HEAR, THE HOSTILITY AGAINST OUR POLICE HAS TO END, AND IT HAS TO END RIGHT NOW.
AND WE HAVE TO SAY TOGETHER, AND WE HAVE TO BE STRONG.
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYONE.
THE TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED IN LOUISIANA AND MINNESOTA, IT WAS TOUGH.
IT WAS TOUGH TO WATCH FOR EVERYBODY HERE IT WAS TOUGH TO WATCH.
WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT.
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.
WAS IT TRAINING?
WAS IT SOMETHING ELSE?
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE.
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY.
REMEMBER THAT.
BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO -- WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS.
WE HAVE TO.
BUT WE CAN NEVER, EVER FORGET THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GREAT DEALS AND GREAT THINGS THAT OUR POLICE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY DO, AND NOBODY RECOGNIZES THEM FOR WHAT THEY DO.
AND WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM, AS BAD AS THESE TWO SITUATIONS WERE, AND I PERSONALLY THINK THEY WERE, THEY WERE BAD.
I HATED, I HATED WATCHING IT.
BUT AS BAD AS THEY WERE, THEY GET BROADCAST ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR DAYS AND DAYS, AND ALL OF THE GOOD THINGS WHICH ARE MAGNIFIED THOUSANDS OF TIMES, NOBODY TALKS ABOUT.
SO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO CHERISH AND TAKE CARE OF OUR POLICE.
IF WE DON'T, IF WE DON'T, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE.
WE HAVE A COUNTRY IN CHAOS.
AND REMEMBER THIS.
AND I SAY IT ONCE, AND I SAY IT WITH LOVE, AND I SAY IT WITH COMPASSION.
BECAUSE I HAVE LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND I HAVE GREAT COMPASSION FOR OUR PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY.
BUT I AM THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE.
WE NEED LAW AND ORDER, AND WE NEED STRENGTH IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE DON'T HAVE STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, AS CROOKED AS YOU GET.
I MEAN, YOU SAW THAT WITH THE E-MAILS.
IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM, FOLKS.
IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM.
JUST REMEMBER IT.
IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM.
IT'S RIGGED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.
WE'RE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.
YOU CAN'T EVEN WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.
WE HAD A YOUNG MAN WHO DID NOTHING BY COMPARISON TO WHAT SHE DID, AND HE WARNED HIS FRIENDS OF A PROBLEM THAT WAS COMING MILITARILY.
AND THEY CAME DOWN ON HIM WITH A VENGEANCE.
AND THEY LET HER GO.
33,000 MISSING E-MAILS.
THEY LET HER GO.
LIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.
AND THEY LET HER GO.
THINK OF IT.
IT'S A DISGRACE.
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET ON TO OTHER SUBJECTS.
BUT I HAVE TO SAY LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO REMAIN WITH US.
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR POLICE AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO IT.
WE'RE GOING REMEMBER THAT THEY DO A FABULOUS JOB.
WE'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THAT THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, PROBLEMS WILL HAPPEN.
AND WE'RE GOING TAKE CARE OF THOSE PROBLEMS.
AND THEY CAN BE BAD PROBLEMS.
BUT WE ARE GOING TO TREAT OUR POLICE WITH RESPECT.
REMEMBER THAT.
OKAY?
NOW I'M LOOKING AT DIFFERENT RATES AND DIFFERENT CRIMES.
AND YOU SEE THE CRIME RATE IN LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY IS GOING WAY UP.
YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN INNER CITIES, AND LOOK AT CHICAGO.
LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON.
SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT, ALMOST 5,000 KILLINGS IN CHICAGO.
AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT.
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT IT.
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS A SAFE COUNTRY.
AND, YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY TWO WEEKS AGO, A MONTH AGO, I WOULDN'T BE SAYING THESE WORDS.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BORDER.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WALL.
AND WE WILL BUILD THE WALL.
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
I CAN TELL YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
ARE YOU READY?
WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?
I DON'T HEAR YOU.
WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?
AND THEY WILL.
VERY MUCH.
THEY WILL.
100%.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'LL BE HAPPY TO PAY FOR THE WALL.
WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR.
WE'RE LOSING ON THE BORDER.
WE'RE LOSING ON TRADE.
AND WHEN I WAS IN THE DEBATES AND I MENTIONED THIS, PEOPLE WOULD COME UP THAT I WAS DEBATING AGAINST, AND THEY USED TO SAY DONALD, YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO BUILD A WALL, ARE YOU?
I SAY ABSOLUTELY.
THEY SAY BUT YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL.
BUT I'M IN THE CONSTRUCTION.
YOU KNOW HOW EASY A WALL IS?
A WALL.
WE BUILD 95-STORY BUILDINGS WITH BATHROOMS.
THAT'S TOUGH CONSTRUCTION, NOT A WALL.
WALLS DON'T HAVE BATHROOMS.
AND BATHROOMS ARE ALWAYS TOUGH.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY BIG BEAUTIFUL GATE IN THAT WALL, BIG AND BEAUTIFUL.
AND THAT GATE IS GOING TO BE OPEN.
AND IT'S GOING TO BE WIDE OPEN FOR PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY LEGALLY.
THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY.
AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT LOVE OUR COUNTRY.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT HATE OUR COUNTRY.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT COME FROM THE MIGRATION THAT DON'T HAVE PAPERWORK, THAT DON'T HAVE PASSPORTS, THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY'RE FROM.
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEIR MOTIVES ARE.
WE'RE GOING TO SAY NO.
SORRY.
NO.
AND WE'LL HELP.
AND IN SYRIA, WE'LL BUILD SAFE ZONES, AND WE'LL GET OTHER PEOPLE TO PUT UP THE MONEY, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO OWE VERY SOON 20 TRILLION, TRILLION WITH A T. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS.
WE'RE GOING TO OWE -- RIGHT NOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
$20 TRILLION.
SOON GOING TO $21 TRILLION.
SO WE'RE GOING GET THE GULF STATES WHO HAVE SO MUCH MONEY, FOLKS.
SO MUCH MONEY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM TO PUT UP THE MONEY AND OTHERS.
AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.
AND WE'RE GOING HAVE COMPASSION.
BUT WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN ORLANDO.
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN BERNARDINO.
WE CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.
SO WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SAFE ZONES.
WE'RE GOING TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE FUND THESE SAFE ZONES.
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY.
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN IRAQ.
BUT ONCE WE WENT INTO IRAQ, WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT THE WAY WE LEFT.
WE LEFT LIKE FOOLS.
WE WENT IN, SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO FROM THE BEGINNING, AND I HAVE PROOF FROM THE BEGINNING.
I DIDN'T WANT IRAQ.
I SAID YOU'RE GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
BUT THEN WE WERE THERE.
LOSING THOUSANDS OF LIVES, SPENDING TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
PROBABLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE'RE UP TO $4 TRILLION.
AND WE'RE IN WORSE SHAPE NOW THAN WE WERE 15 YEARS AGO BEFORE THE WHOLE DEAL STARTED.
FAR WORSE.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
FAR WORSE.
FAR WORSE.
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO START THINKING SMART.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SMART AGAIN.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT MILITARY, AND BY THE WAY, I SAID FOR YEARS WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THE OIL.
I SAID KEEP THE OIL.
YOU LEAVE, YOU KEEP THE OIL.
WE DIDN'T DO IT.
WE DIDN'T DO IT.
I SAID IT FOR YEARS.
ONCE WE WERE IN, I SAID WHEN WE GET OUT, IT'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER, BUT WHEN WE GET OUT, WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT SOME TROOPS THERE.
AND I HATE SAYING THAT.
BUT WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT SOME TROOPS THERE, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, CERTAINLY, THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW.
CAN'T BE ANY WORSE.
BUT I ALWAYS SAID KEEP THE OIL.
BUT WE DIDN'T KEEP THE OIL.
SO WHO HAS THE OIL RIGHT NOW?
A LOT OF THE OIL IS HAD BY ISIS.
AND WE CREATED ISIS.
AND HILLARY CLINTON THROUGH HER INCOMPETENCE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY CREATED ISIS.
AND NOW SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF IT.
SHE SAYS YES, WE WILL FIGHT ISIS.
SHE IS THE ONE THAT CREATED IT WITH STUPIDITY, WITH STUPID, STUPID POLICY.
POLICY THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.
SHE IS THE ONE THAT CREATED IT.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.
AND SO NOW WE HAVE PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
WE HAVE OUR CITIES EXPLODING.
WE HAVE ISIS LOOKING AT US.
AND BY THE WAY, WHEN OUR ENEMIES ALL OVER THE WORLD, INCLUDING OUR FRIENDS ALL OVER THE WORLD LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY, WHERE THE OTHER NIGHT YOU HAD 11, THINK OF IT, 11 CITIES POTENTIALLY IN A BLOWUP STAGE.
MARCHES ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, AND TOUGH MARCHES, ANGER, HATRED, HATRED.
STARTED BY A MANIAC THAT SOME PEOPLE ASKED FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR HIM.
FOR THE KILLER, FOR THE KILLER.
OKAY?
SO WHEN OUR ENEMIES LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR COUNTRY, THEY SEE OUR DEFICITS.
THEY SEE WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE.
WE DON'T WIN.
WE DON'T WIN.
WE DON'T WIN AT ANYTHING.
I ALWAYS SAY WHEN I WAS GOING, WHEN I WAS YOUNG GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL AND GOING TO COLLEGE AND BEFORE THAT WE NEVER LOST.
YOU KNOW, UNITED STATES, THEY SAID HAD NEVER LOST A WAR.
NOW WE NEVER WIN.
WE DON'T WIN ON TRADE.
WE DON'T WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.
OUR MILITARY IS SO DEPLETED, OUR MILITARY HAS FIGHTER JETS THAT ARE IN USE FLOWN BY GREAT, GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE SO OLD, AND THEY CAN'T GET PARTS FOR THE FIGHTER JETS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE FLYING THESE JETS NOW IN COMBAT.
THEY CAN'T GET PARTS.
SO THEY GO TO THE PLANE GRAVEYARDS IN THE DESERTS.
THEY GO TO MUSEUMS WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR PLANES, AND THEY STRIP APART TO USE FOR OUR FIGHTER PILOTS TO FLY.
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN REDUCED TO.
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.
HILLARY CLINTON IS INCOMPETENT, OKAY.
THE GREATEST SINGLE THING IN MY OPINION THAT SHE'S EVER DONE IS TO GET OUT OF THE E-MAIL PROBLEM.
I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLE.
SHE DID A GREAT JOB ON THAT.
I THINK IT IS HER GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT.
I THINK WHEN THEY LOOK BACK ON HILLARY CLINTON, THEY WILL SAY THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON WAS GETTING OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WITH E-MAIL TZ.
HOUDINI COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OUT.
SHE WAS SO GUILTY.
I HAVE A LIST.
LOOK.
PAGE AFTER PAGE OF THE LIES -- PAGE AFTER PAGE OF THE LIES.
ALL OVER.
LOOK AT THIS.
PAGE, PAGE.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO READ IT TO YOU.
THE PRESS WOULD SAY, YOU SHOULD SPEND YOUR ENTIRE SPEECH TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND THE E-MAILS.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WAS ALL LIES, FOLKS.
I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND BORE EVERYBODY.
IT WAS SO HORRIBLE.
IT WAS SO DISGUSTING.
IT WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS.
YOU LOOK AT GENERAL PETRAEUS AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM FOR A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT CROOKED HILLARY DID.
YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE, FOR A TINY FRACTION, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.
SO I JUST TELL YOU THIS, WE HAVE A CANDIDATE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO, IF SHE EVER GETS ELECTED, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE DISGUSTING YEARS OF OBAMA, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF WEAKNESS, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF CIVIL UNREST.
IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF NOT WINNING WITH OUR MILITARY AND NOT WINNING AGAINST ISIS.
THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO BEAT ISIS.
THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
BUT IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF OBAMA, AND OBAMA CARE AND ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT DON'T WORK.
EXCEPT I THINK ACTUALLY IT WILL BE WORSE.
TODAY I SEE BERNIE SANDERS GAVE HER THIS VERY YOU KNOW, SORT OF STRANGE ENDORSEMENT.
I WANT TO TELL YOU, A LOT OF BERNIE SANDERS PEOPLE ARE SO UPSET ABOUT IT, THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.
THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.
BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT BERNIE SANDERS AND I HAVE IN COMMON WAS TRADE.
NOW HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
HE JUST KNEW IT WAS BAD.
I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.
BECAUSE I AM IN FAVOR OF FREE TRADE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY I'M AN ISOLATIONIST, WHEN YOU LOSE $800 BILLION A YEAR ON TRADE DEFICITS, MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE WORSE THING.
BUT WE'LL STRAIGHT IT OUT.
I BELIEVE IN OPEN BORDERS FOR TRADE AND FREE TRADE.
THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY THAT DEALS WITH US ARE FAR SHARPER AND FAR BETTER.
THEY HAVE THEIR BEST NEGOTIATORS.
WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING FOR US AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
I HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESSMEN IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE ENDORSED ME, INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE CARL ICAHN, GREAT BUSINESSMAN.
WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS, MAYBE THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD AND WE DON'T USE THEM.
WE USE POLITICAL HACKS.
WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THERE THAT GOT IN FOR POLITICS.
YOU COULD LOOK AT THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, AND IT IS SMALL POTATOES.
IT IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO SOME OF THE MASSIVE TRADE DEALS.
AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NEVER BE NEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS.
JUST LIKE WE HAVE SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN, AND WHAT THEY DID TO HIM AND YOU BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING AND WHAT HE GAVE AWAY, ISRAEL IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY, FRANKLY WE'RE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY, AND WE MADE A POWER OUT OF IRAN.
WE MADE A POWER.
NUMBER ONE, WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER GONE IN AND NEGOTIATED THAT DEAL UNTIL WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK.
EVER.
EVER.
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER, EVER GONE IN.
AND WHAT YOU SAY IS, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO GET THEM BACK.
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM BACK, YOU LEAVE THE MEETING.
YOU LEAVE THE MEETING.
AND YOU DOUBLE UP YOUR SANCTIONS, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD THEM BACK WITHIN 24 HOURS, I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.
BUT WE DSHTIDN'T DO THAT.
I KEPT WAITING FOR THE WHOLE DELEGATION, I KEPT WAITING FOR THEM TO LEAVE, TO GET UP AND LEAVE.
I USED TO SAY GET UP AND LEAVE.
PERFECT.
GET UP.
WE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING.
THE ONLY TIME THAT KERRY LEFT WAS AT 73 YEARS OLD TO GO INTO A BICYCLE LACE WHERE HE FELL AND BROKE HIS LEG, RIGHT.
AND I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER ENTER A BICYCLE RACE WHEN I'M IN THE MIDST OF AN IMPORTANT NUCLEAR NEGOTIATION, I PROMISE.
I PROMISE.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, NUMBER ONE, WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THEM BACK.
AND THE OTHER THING, WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN THEM BACK THE $150 BILLION.
AND I WOULD HAVE SAID VERY NICELY, MY FATHER USED TO THINK I WAS A LITTLE BIT ROUGH, AND HE USED TO GO, EASY, SON.
SON, TAKE IT NICE AND EASY.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.
HE HAD AN EXPRESSION.
GOOD FATHER.
WE ALL HAVE GREAT FATHERS, I HOPE.
I HAD A GOOD FATHER.
BUT I LEARNED A LOT.
HE SAID, AND HE WOULD GO LIKE THIS THE LUMPS OUT.
TAKE THE LUMPS.
EASY.
NICE AND EASY.
TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.
YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO ROUGH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, POP?
YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO ROUGH.
AND OVER THE YEARS, I THINK I LEARNED THAT.
MADE GREAT DEALS AND BUILT A GREAT COMPANY.
GREAT COMPANY.
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF EVERY SINGLE THING YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING FOR YOURSELF AND FAMILIES AND YOUR EMPLOYEES AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS, SOME OF THE LAWS ARE THE DUMBEST LAWS I'VE EVER SEEN AND SO STUPID BUT YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.
YOU'RE LIKE A BUSINESS PERSON, RIGHT, GOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.
BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY REPRESENTING YOUR EMPLOYEES, YOUR COMPANY AND YOUR FAMILY.
BUT MY FATHER WOULD SAY TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.
SO HERE IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID ON THE 150.
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN I'M YOUNG, I WOULD SAY WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU BACK THE 150 BILLION, YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.
AND THERE COULD BE A LOT OF HARD FEELING IN THE ROOM.
TAKE A WHILE -- THEY WILL STILL COME BACK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
BECAUSE THEY NEED US.
THEY NEED US.
AND THEN I WOULD HAVE LEFT AND HERE GO THE SANCTIONS.
I WOULD HAVE DONE TWO THINGS.
NUMBER ONE, HOSTAGES BEFORE WE UTTER THE FIRST WORD.
AND NUMBER TWO -- AND HOW LONG WERE THE HOSTAGES THERE.
THAT NEGOTIATION TOOK FOREVER AND WE DIDN'T WIN A POINT.
WE LOST EVERYTHING.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE A NUCLEAR POWER AND THEY ARE RICH AND POWERFUL.
HOW ABOUT YEMEN.
THEY ARE FIGHTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YEMEN.
AND THEY'RE FIGHTING AND WEE FIGHTING.
WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE THE DEAL TO GET OUT OF YEMEN AND KERRY SAID BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME PLIBLG ATE -- COMPLICATE THE NEGOTIATIONS.
THEY DON'T WANT TO BRING SOMETHING ELSE TO COMPLICATE IT.
THESE ARE AMATEURS.
BUT MY FATHER WOULD SAY TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.
SO HERE IS WHAT I WOULD SAY.
WE WOULDN'T BE NEGOTIATING BECAUSE OUR PRISONERS WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK YEARS AGO.
I WOULD HAVE SAID, LOOK, FELLAS, HERE IS THE STORY.
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
OUR COUNTRY IS FLAT BROKE.
WE OWE 19 TRILLION AND GOING TO BE 20 TRILLION OR $21 TRILLION WITH THE OMNIBUS VERY SOON.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY BACK, I REALLY DO.
WE DON'T HAVE IT, I'M SORRY.
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE NUTS.
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO GIVE US -- NO, NO, WE WANT TO.
WE DON'T HAVE IT.
I WANT TO SO BADLY.
WE LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE SUCH GREAT PEOPLE.
SUCH NICE PEOPLE.
SO KIND.
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY DO TO THEIR HOSTAGE AND PRISONERS AND YOU'LL FIND OUT ABOUT TOUGH PEOPLE.
GREAT NEGOTIATORS.
PERSIANS, GREAT NEGOTIATORS.
I WOULD HAVE SAID, REMEMBER, NICE AND EASY.
I WOULD HAVE RATHER DONE IT MY WAY, BUT I RESPECTED MY FATHER.
SO I WOULD HAVE SAID, WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, CAN'T DO IT.
THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT AND WE WOULD HAVE LEFT AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK IN TWO WEEKS.
WE WOULD HAVE SAVED $150 BILLION.
SO THOSE TWO THINGS.
WE WOULD HAVE HAD OUR HOSTAGES BACK AND SAVED $150 BILLION.
NOW THEY ARE SO RICH, THEY ARE BUYING AIRLINERS, THEY ARE BUYING EVERYTHING.
THEY ARE BUYING PROBABLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT, OKAY.
WHAT THE HELL -- DO YOU HAVE TO -- NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEM MAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THEY'LL BUY THEM.
THEY HAVE THE MONEY.
THEY MADE SUCH FOOLS OUT OF US.
FOLKS, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.
THEY'RE OVER.
THEY'RE OVER.
I CALL OBAMA THE FIVE-FOR-ONE PRESIDENT.
SO WE HAVE A TRADER NAMED SERGEANT BERGDAHL.
SO SERGEANT BERGDAHL THINKS HE LIKES THEIR WAY OF LIFE, OBVIOUSLY.
OH, THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL WAY OF LIFE.
SO ONE DAY HE LEAVES.
WE LOSE FIVE AND MAYBE SIX, BUT FIVE AT LEAST PEOPLE LOOKING FOR HIM.
THEY WERE KILLED.
THEY WERE KILLED BY THE ENEMY.
THEY GO OUT THERE LOOKING FOR HIM.
THEY KNEW HE LEFT.
EVERYBODY WITH HIM KNEW HE LEFT BECAUSE HE WAS ALL WHACKED OUT AND A BELIEVER IN THEM, NOT US.
SO THEY KNEW HE LEFT.
SO KNOWING THAT, THE FACT THEY HAVE A COLONEL AND I BELIEVE A GENERAL TALKING TO THE PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM, AND THEY TOLD THE COLONEL AND THE GENERAL THAT HE LEFT.
HE DESERTED.
REMEMBER THE OLD DAY, A DESERTER, WHAT HAPPENED?
BANG.
20 YEARS AGO, IT WAS BANG, BUT SLOWLY.
TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS LONG PRISON.
TODAY THEY ARE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT NOTHING.
THAT IS WHERE WE'VE COME.
BUT I CALL HIM THE FIVE-FOR-ONE.
SO WE GET BERGDAHL, RIGHT, A TRADER.
AND THEY GET FIVE OF THE MOST VICIOUS KILLERS THAT THEY HAVE, THAT THEY'VE BEEN AFTER FOR NINE YEARS TO GET THEM OUT AND THEY BRING THEM AND THEY ARE BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD TRYING TO KILL EVERYBODY, INCLUDING US.
THIS STUFF HAS GOT TO STOP, FOLKS.
AND GITMO, WE'RE NOT CLOSING GITMO.
WE'RE GOING TO FILL IT UP.
WE'RE NOT CLOSING GITMO.
WE'RE NOT CLOSING GITMO.
AND I SEE HILLARY CLINTON SAID, I DO NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S TONE.
LOOK, HERE IS THE STORY.
I THINK I HAVE A GREAT TEMPERAMENT.
SHE USES THE WORD TEMPERAMENT BUT I LOVE WHEN SHE USES THE WORD TONE.
THEY ARE CHOPPING HEADS OFF OF CHRISTIANS AND EVERYBODY ELSE.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES.
YOU READ THE HISTORY BOOKS, THEY CHOPPED OFF HEADS.
WELL, THEY ARE CHOPPING OFF HEADS.
THEY ARE DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES, BY THE DOZENS, AT A TIME.
AND SHE SAYS, WE DON'T LIKE HIS TONE.
LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, IT IS TIME FOR A TOUGH TONE.
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS THE SMART WAY.
I REMEMBER DURING THE DEBATE THEY ASKED ONE OF THE FOLKS ON THE DEBUT STAGE WHO IS BECOMING FRIENDLIER AND FRIENDLIER BY THE DAY WITH ME, WHICH SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE RECOVERING.
IT WAS -- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
THEY SAY IT WAS THE NASTIEST PRIMARY THAT ANYBODY HAS SEEN.
THEY SAY THE NASTIEST IN RECORDED HISTORY.
WHO KNEW WHAT WENT ON BEFORE RECORDED.
BUT IT WAS PRETTY NASTY.
AND SOME OF THE FOLKS, I SAW ONE YESTERDAY, I WILL NOT EVEN MENTION NAMES BECAUSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY, RIGHT.
I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH THEM.
EXCEPT FOR THE REAL ENEMY.
BUT THEY'LL SIGN A DOCUMENT, ALL RIGHT, IT IS CALLED A PLEDGE.
I PLEDGE -- I PLEDGE, I SWEAR, I PLEDGE THAT IF I DON'T MAKE IT, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE NOMINEE OF THE PARTY.
IT DOESN'T SAY, SUBJECT TO CHANGE, SUBJECT TO THE WEATHER, SUBJECT TO THE SUN DOESN'T COME UP.
NO.
IT SAID, I PLEDGE.
AND FOR THAT PLEDGE, THEY GOT ACCESS TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MATERIAL FROM THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, THE RNC.
REINCE PRIEBUS, DOING A GREAT JOB.
AND IF HE DOESN'T, I'LL TELL YOU.
AND IF HE DOESN'T OVER THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS, I'LL TELL YOU.
BUT THEY GOT ACCESS.
SO THEY SIGNED A PLEDGE THEY WILL SUPPORT.
I DON'T WANT THEIR SUPPORT.
IT WON'T MEAN ONE VOTE THAN PERHAPS THEIR FAMILY.
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
BUT I SIGNED THE PLEDGE, TOO.
AND EVERYBODY WANTED TO SIGN THE PLEDGE.
AND THE REASON THEY SIGNED THE PLEDGE WAS TO GET ME TO SIGN IT.
I SIGNED IT.
I WOULD HAVE HONORED IT.
I SAID PEOPLE SHOULD HONOR PLEDGES.
PEOPLE SHOULD HONOR DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY SIGN THEM.
YOU KNOW, NOT A BIG DEAL.
NOT A BIG DEAL.
BUT THEY SHOULD HONOR THEM.
SO HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS.
WE'RE LOSING OUR COUNTRY.
WE'RE LIKE A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE AT THE BORDERS.
THAT IS GOING TO END.
THAT'S GOING TO END.
YOU KNOW, THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, 16,500, FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THEY'VE DONE THIS, THEY'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP.
THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE BORDER.
AND BY THE WAY, IF AND WHEN WE WIN, IT IS WE -- I'M JUST A MESSENGER FOLKS, I'M TELLING A MESSAGE OF COMMON STRENGTH BUT I'M JUST YOUR MESSENGER AND I'M DOING A GOOD JOB AS A MAEPGESSENGER, IN ALL FAIRNESS, BUT 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT THEY DO NOW IS STAND THERE WITH BEAUTIFUL EQUIPMENT, GREAT PEOPLE, PEOPLE WALK RIGHT BY THEM.
THAT IS AN EASY JOB.
THEY CAN'T STAND IT.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT IS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.
THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB.
WITH ME, THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING REALLY HARD.
AND I SAID TO THEM, WHEN THEY CALLED ME TO TELL ME ABOUT THE ENDORSEMENT, NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, THEY'VE NEVER ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE, 16,500, GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE AND I SAID TO THEM, SO LET ME TELL YOU, I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION -- HOW IMPORTANT IS THE WALL?
THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, THE WALL IS VITAL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF THEY SAID IT IS NOT IMPORTANT.
I WOULD HAVE SAID, I GUESS WE'RE NOT BUILDING IT BECAUSE I RESPECT THESE PEOPLE, THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY.
THEY KNOW A HELL OF A LOT OF BETTER THAN CONSULTANTS AND PEOPLE MAKING A MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
WHO IS BETTER AT THAT?
I SAID HOW IMPORTANT IS THE WALL?
MR. TRUMP, NEVER FORGET THE ANSWER, THE WALL IS VITAL.
IT IS VITAL.
VERY IMPORTANT.
VERY IMPORTANT.
THEY ACTUALLY SAID IT IS A TOOL TOWARD REAL SECURITY, AN IMPORTANT TOOL.
AND THEN I SPOKE WITH SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO FROM ARIZONA AND HE CALLED ME OUT OF THE BLUE AND I'VE READ ABOUT SHERIFF JOE, I MEAN, HE KNOWS BORDERS, RIGHT.
AMAZING GUY.
TOUGH GUY.
BUT HE'S AN AMAZING GUY.
AND HE SAID, MR. TRUMP, I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW THAT I'M ENDORSING YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS STUFF THAN ANYBODY, YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS STUFF THAN PEOPLE DOING IT FOR 25 YEARS.
YOU GET IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.
I'M ENDORSING YOU.
AND HE'S ACTUALLY A QUALITY PERSON.
HE'S A TOUGH GUY.
BUT HE'S A QUALITY PERSON.
HE GETS THE JOB DONE.
AMAZING.
SO I KNOW ABOUT THAT.
AND WHEN IT WAS COMING TIME FOR THE WALL, I'LL NEVER FORGET, VICENTE FOX, ON ONE OF THE MAJOR NETWORKS, USED THE F-BOMB.
REMEMBER AND I TOLD THIS STORY A COUPLE OF TIMES.
HE SAID, WE WILL NOT PAY FOR THE F-BOMB WALL.
AND I SAID, OH, HE'S DEAD.
CAN YOU IMAGINE, HEADLINES TOMORROW.
HE USED IT ON LIVE TELEVISION.
AND I SAID, OH, I FEEL SO BADLY FOR THE GUY.
AND NOW IN ONE WAY I WAS HAPPY.
BECAUSE HE USED TO SAY, WE'LL NEVER BUILD THE WALL.
NOW HE'S SAYING WE'LL NEVER PAY FOR THE WALL.
SO WE MADE PROGRESS.
ADD LEAST HE'S NOW ADMITTING IT IS GOING TO GET BUILT, RIGHT.
AND HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE GUY BUT HE GOT A LITTLE BIT ROUGH.
WE WILL NEVER PAY FOR THE -- F-BOMB -- WALL.
I SAID OH, THE POOR GUY HE IS GOING TO GET KILLED IN THE PAPERS.
NOBODY MENTIONED IT.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I THREW OUT THE F-BOMB.
I THINK IT WILL BE THE ELECTRIC CHAIR, RIGHT.
WOULD IT BE THE ELECTRIC CHAIR.
AND THE PRESS, I WILL TELL YOU -- THE PEOPLE BACK THERE, AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS, NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE THE MOST DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS ON THE EARTH.
THEY ARE THE MOST DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH.
I'VE HAD DAYS THAT ARE SO GOOD, AND THEN YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND YOU SAY, MAN, DID THEY TAKE THAT.
I WON'T EVEN SAY WHAT THINGS -- I COULD GO ONE AFTER ANOTHER.
AND WE DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES, ALL OF US, WE DON'T MAKE MISTAKES BUT WHAT THEY DO IS TAKE A SENTENCE AND MAKE IT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU SAID, MUCH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU MEANT.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY'LL SAY, DONALD TRUMP HAD A BAD WEEK BECAUSE HE SAID SOMETHING PERFECT.
PERFECT.
OKAY.
PERFECT.
I'M TELLING YOU, FOLKS, AND I TELL IT ALL OF THE TIME, BECAUSE AS A REPUBLICAN, AND AS A REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE, WE ARE AT A TREMENDOUS DISADVANTAGE.
YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THEY TREAT CROOKED HILLARY, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS COMPARED TO THE WAY THEY TREAT OTHER PEOPLE, OR THE WAY THEY TREAT ME, THEY ARE SOME OF THE WORST HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH.
I REALLY MEAN IT.
I REALLY MEAN IT.
YOU KNOW, WHERE ARE MY PROTESTS.
I WANT SOME PROTESTERS.
YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THIS ROOM.
THE GOVERNOR JUST SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN A ROOM LIKE THIS IN INDIANA WITH THIS MANY PEOPLE.
HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
LOOK AT THIS THING.
THIS IS WHERE YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM -- LOOK AT THE CEILINGS.
EVERYTHING IS NIGHT.
I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE WALL IS GOING TO BE REALLY HIGH, BUT THAT IS REALLY HIGH UP THERE.
THAT IS A BIG ONE.
BUT YOU DON'T SEE CROWDS LIKE THIS.
WE HAVE CROWDS LIKE THIS EVERYWHERE, NO MATTER WHERE WE GO.
AND EVERY TIME I GO HOME AND MY WIFE SAYS HOW WAS THE CROWD.
AND I ALWAYS SAY, DIDN'T YOU SEE IT?
THEY KEEP THOSE CAMERAS ON MY FACE, THEY NEVER TAKE THE CAMERAS OFF MY FACE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE -- I WISH THEY WOULD TURN THE CAMERAS OVER HERE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CROWD.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CROWD.
LOOK, THE CAMERAS AREN'T MOVING.
THEY ARE REALLY DISHONEST.
I REALLY MEAN THIS.
THEY ARE SO DISHONEST.
THAT IS WHY I LOVE MY PROTESTERS.
BECAUSE THE ONLY TIME THEY MOVE THE CAMERAS ARE WHEN WE HAVE A PROTEST.
IF SOMEBODY WERE UP THERE SCREAMING OR SHOUTING, THE CAMERAS, WHICH I USED TO THINK WERE IN A FIXED POSITION, I SAID MAYBE MECHANICALLY THEY CAN'T MOVE, BUT WHEN WE HAVE A PROTESTER, THEY TURN AND -- THEY ARE LIKE A PRETZEL ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THROUGH THE CAMERAMAN'S LEGS, UP AROUND HIS ANKLES.
YOU NEVER SAW CAMERAS MOVE LIKE THIS.
THE FACT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.
AND THE SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL IN MANY WAYS, BUT REALLY BAD IN OTHERS.
AND ONE OF THE WORST ASPECTS OF OUR SYSTEM IS THE DISHONEST PRESS.
THE DISHONEST MEDIA IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS.
I REALLY MEAN IT.
THEY WRITE AND SAY THINGS THAT ARE DISGRACEFUL.
SO -- AND I LIKE TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN PEOPLE SEE OR READ OR HEAR THINGS, THEY'LL SAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE -- PEOPLE SAY WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?
I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS HOW SMART THE PEOPLE ARE.
BECAUSE THEIR RATING IS SO LOW, THEY ARE SO -- THOUGHT OF SO BADLY, IT IS LIKE HOW SMART THE PEOPLE WERE.
AND I'LL SAY THIS.
VARIOUS ANCHORS, SOME OF WHOM TRULY DISLIKE DONALD TRUMP HAVE SAID WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US -- TO US, I'M THE MESSENGER, YOU'RE THE IMPORTANT ONES IN THIS WHOLE THING, BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO US IS ONE OF THE GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENONS THEY'VE EVER SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT.
BILL O'REILLY, OF COURSE I'M ON HIS SHOW TONIGHT SO IF YOU GET HOME YOU WILL SEE THE SECOND EDITION.
BUT BILL O'REILLY SAID, THE SINGLE GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENON THAT HE'S SEEN IN HIS LIFETIME.
NOW HE'S A PRO.
A SMART GUY AND TOUGH.
TOUGH.
BUT THE SINGLE GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENON THAT HE'S SEEN IN HIS LIFETIME IS DONALD TRUMP AND ALL OF US, THE WHOLE THING.
WE'VE BEEN ON THE COVER -- WE'VE BEEN ON THE COVER OF "TIME" MAGAZINE, SO MUCH THAT IT BECOMES ROUTINE.
IN FACT, THEY JUST TOLD ME, MR. TRUMP, SIR, YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF "TIME" MAGAZINE AGAIN THIS WEEK.
I SAID ALL RIGHT.
IN THE OLD DAYS, I WOULD SAY THAT IS A BIG DEAL.
AND NOW IT IS LIKE, REALLY, THAT IS GOOD, THAT IS ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE.
I'M NOT ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE.
YOU'RE ON THE COVER.
JUST REMEMBER THAT.
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE.
WE HAVE A BADEN EMMY, WE HAVE AN ENEMY THAT IS DISHONEST AND A PRESS THAT IS DISHONEST.
WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET ELECTED WHO HAVE A RIGGED SYSTEM AND WHO HAVE REALLY RIGGED THE SYSTEM TO A LARGE EXTENT.
THEY'VE REALLY RIGGED THE SYSTEM.
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS, BUT THE SUPER-DELEGATES, THAT WAS WORSE THAN WHAT HAPPENED WITH US.
AND FRANKLY, THE ONLY REASON I COULD WIN IS WE WON IN SUCH LANDSLIDES ALL OVER THE PLACE, INCLUDING IN INDIANA.
WHAT A LANDSLIDE THAT WAS.
AND WE LOVE BOBBY KNIGHT.
DO WE LOVE BOBBY KNIGHT.
OH, THAT BOBBY KNIGHT.
I LOVE MY BOBBY KNIGHT.
WE HAD SO MANY COACHES, GENE AND DIGGER AND BOBBY.
WE HAD SO MANY COACHES.
LOU, LOU HOLTS.
WE HAD SO MANY COACHES THAT CAME OUT IN OUR FAVOR.
I DO WELL WITH COACHES.
BUT THE COACHES LIKE ME.
BUT BOBBY WAS OUT HERE WORKING REALLY HARD.
AND I COULD SEE IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING.
THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE WATER SHED.
BUT BOBBY CAME OUT AND I CAME OUT AND WE WENT TO A RINAS -- ARENA ARENAS, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE.
MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN AT SOME OF THE ARENAS.
IT IS AMAZING.
SO HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS.
WE HAVE TO STOP FOUR MORE YEARS OF OBAMA.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HILLARY CLINTON, WHO IS AS CROOKED AS THEY COME.
WE'VE GOT TO BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK.
WE HAVE TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS AGAIN.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE DEAL THAT'S BRING OUR JOBS BACK.
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG GREAT WITH THESE COUNTRIES AND TRADE WITH THESE COUNTRIES.
I AM NOT AN ISOLATIONIST, I'M A FREE TRADER.
BUT I'M A FREE TRADE TORE MAKE GREAT DEAL -- TRADE TORE MAKE GREAT DEALS, NOT TO MAKE HORRIBLE DEALS.
ONE OF THE PEOPLE STANDING RIGHT THERE, SAID TO ME, MR. TRUMP, ARE YOU AN ISOLATIONIST, AND MR. TRUMP -- AND I SAID NO.
AND WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF TRADE?
AND I SAID VERY SIMPLE.
I KNOW FREE AND I KNOW EVERY FORM OF TRADE KNOWN TO MANKIND.
HERE IS MY DEFINITION OF TRADE.
MY DEFINITION OF "TRADE" IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE GREAT DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
YOU CAN CALL IT WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT.
OKAY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR MANUFACTURING BACK.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING SINCE BILL CLINTON SIGNED PROBABLY THE WORST DEAL ECONOMICALLY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, NAFTA.
THAT DEAL WAS SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON.
YOU LOOK AT AREAS EVEN FROM HERE, BUT YOU LOOK AT PLACES, YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE NEW ENGLAND AND NEW YORK STATE AND PENNSYLVANIA, GREAT STATE -- WE'RE LEADING IN PENNSYLVANIA BY THE WAY.
IT JUST CAME OUT.
I HEAR WE'RE LEADING IN FLORIDA.
I HEAR WE'RE LEADING IN OHIO.
I HEAR WE'RE LEADING ALL OVER THE PLACE.
AND THE RASMUSSEN POLL JUST CAME OUT, WE'RE LEADING NASHLTIONALLY.
BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.
WE ARE DEALING WITH A DISHONEST SYSTEM AND A CROOKED SYSTEM AND A RIGGED SYSTEM SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO FOLKS, AND WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM US.
AND WHEN THIS PERSON SAID TO ME, BY THE WAY, WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS NEVER DONE BEFORE, CONGRATULATIONS, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU WIN OR LOSE THE ELECTION, WHAT YOU'VE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, WINNING ALL OF THE PRIMARIES, BEATING GREAT PROFESSIONALS AND THEY ARE VERY TALENTED PEOPLE, IT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, YOU WILL GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS, MR. TRUMP.
I SAID DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T EVEN TELL ME ABOUT IT.
BECAUSE IF I DON'T WIN THE NEXT ONE, I WILL CONSIDER IT A BIG, FAT WASTE OF TIME AND $55 MILLION I PUT UP, AND I'M STILL PUTTING UP A LOT MORE.
AND NOW WE RAISED $51 MILLION LAST MONTH AND WE STARTED TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH.
AND EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED.
AND MUCH OF THAT MONEY CAME IN SMALL DONATIONS LIKE $71 AVERAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
AND I PUT UP MILLIONS.
BUT I DID IT, LIKE, I WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE AND I WANT PEOPLE TO REALIZE, I'M RAISING MONEY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE RNC.
THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP OUR MAJORITY.
WE WANT TO KEEP OUR HOUSE.
WE WANT TO KEEP OUR SENATE.
BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF WE CAN DO THAT, AND WE HAVE TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SO GREAT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
GOING TO BE AMAZING.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE RUN OF THE HIGHEST TAXED NATIONS IN THE WORLD.
AND YET IN GOING AROUND AND MEETING WITH PEOPLE, SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE, BIG BUSINESS PEOPLE, IF THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE, AND IF THEY HAD THEIR CHOICE, THEY WOULD RATHER GET RID OF RULES AND REGULATION -- WE HAVE THE WORST REGULATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
THEY ACTUALLY WOULD RATHER PAY MORE TAX, WHICH IS SURPRISING, AND GET RID OF THESE REGULATIONS THAT ARE CHOKING EVERYBODY.
PEOPLE CAN'T RUN THEIR BUSINESSES.
SO WE'RE GOING TO TURN THINGS AROUND.
WE'RE GOING TO TURN THEM AROUND FAST.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING FROM INDIANAPOLIS.
YOU KNOW THAT DEAL VERY WELL.
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE FOLLOWED ME ALL OVER THE PLACE.
1400 PEOPLE, OUT OF JOBS, VISUALLY THEIR MOVING TO MEXICO.
ANY OF THE CARRIER FOLKS IN THIS ROOM?
BECAUSE WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A LOT -- LOOK AT THAT.
WHY ARE YOU IN THE BACK ROW.
YOU SHOULD BE IN THE FRONT ROW.
BUT WE HAD -- DURING THE SEASON, WE HAD SO MANY OF THEM THAT FOLLOWED US AROUND.
THEY FELT SO BADLY.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.
PEOPLE AND COUNTRIES TAKE OUR COMPANIES AND TAKE OUR JOBS, THERE ARE GOING TO BE CONSEQUENCES.
THEY WON'T TAKE THEM.
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET CARRIER COME IN AND MAKE AIR-CONDITIONERS IN MEXICO AND SELL THE AIR-CONDITIONERS TO US, ACROSS A VERY STRONG BORDER NOW, WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.
AND WHEN WE EXPLAIN TO THE HEADS OF CARRIER THAT HERE IS THE STORY, EITHER STAY OR IF YOU WANT TO GO TO MEXICO, WE WISH YOU A LOT OF LUCK BUT WHEN YOU SELL YOUR AIR-CONDITIONERS, YOU ARE GOING TO PAY A 35% TAX FOR THE AIR-CONDITIONERS TO COME ACROSS THE BORDER.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE.
THIS GOVERNMENT WAS THINKING ABOUT LOW INTEREST LOANS, ZERO INTEREST LOANS AND WAYS TO KEEP OUR KPZCOMPANIES.
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
THEY DON'T NEED MONEY.
THEY'RE MAKING PLENTY OF MONEY.
BUT WE WON'T LET THEM JUST TAKE OUR COMPANIES OUT AND FIRE EVERYBODY.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH CARRIER FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS SO SMART AGAIN.
SO HERE IS THETORY, FOLKS.
WE DON'T WIN ANY MORE.
WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.
WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS.
WE HAVE TO END IT.
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.
SO IMPORTANT.
OUR VETS ARE BEING TREATED SO BADLY.
I HAVE SUCH GREAT VETERAN SUPPORT.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE WALL -- OH, THAT WALL IS GOING TO BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS A WALL COULD BE.
SOMEBODY SAID, MR. TRUMP, SIR, THEY'RE GOING TO CALL IT THE TRUMP WALL.
I SAID, WELL THEN I BETTER BUILD IT BIG AND BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT.
NO.
NO, I DON'T WANT THAT.
BUT WE NEED -- WE NEED GREAT BORDERS.
BECAUSE WITHOUT BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS.
OUR JOBS ARE GOING TO COME BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON TRADE.
RIGHT NOW WE LOSE ALL OF THIS MONEY.
YOU LOOK AT JAPAN, THE BIGGEST SHIPS YOU'VE EVER SEEN FLOATING IN, AND I WAS IN LOS ANGELES, THEY FLOAT IN THESE MASSIVE, MASSIVE SHIPS LOADED UP WITH CARS.
AND THE CARS ARE POURING JUST LIKE -- I MEAN, NASCAR.
I LOVE NASCAR.
I LOVE BRIAN FRANCE.
HE ENDORSED ME FROM NASCAR, RIGHT.
NASCAR.
IT IS LIKE NASCAR DRIVERS.
KING RICHARD ENDORSED ME.
A LOT OF THE GUYS ENDORSED ME.
RICHARD PETTY.
THEY COME IN AND THEY ARE POURING OFF THESE BOATS.
WE SEND THEM WHEAT.
WE SEND THEM BEEF.
AND WHEN IT GETS THERE, THEY DON'T EVEN WANT IT.
THEY SEND IT BACK.
YOU WANT TO SEE TRADE IMBALANCE, LOOK AT THE IMBALANCE WE HAVE WITH JAPAN.
IT WILL END, FOLKS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SMART PEOPLE NOW.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS AND FAIR DEALS AND GET ALONG GREAT WITH JAPAN.
WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG BETTER WITH THESE COUNTRIES AND THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT US FAIRLY.
AND WE HAVE ALL OF THE CARDS.
JUST REMEMBER THAT.
WE'RE THE PIGGY BANK.
BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BREAK OUR PIGGY BANK VERY SOON.
BUT WITH THE PIGGY BANK, THEY TAKE THE MONEY OUT.
WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA.
THE MONEY THEY'VE TAKEN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, I MEAN THEY HAVE TRAINS THAT CAN HE CAN ONLY DREAM ABOUT.
THEY HAVE HIGHWAYS THAT WE CAN ONLY DREAM ABOUT.
PLACES OUTSIDE OF THIS COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, DIFFERENT PLACES HAVE AIRPORTS THAT WE CAN ONLY DREAM ABOUT.
WE USED TO BE AT THE TOP.
NOW WE'RE LIKE A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.
SO HERE IS WHAT I SAY.
WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR JOBS BACK.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR PRIDE BACK.
I OFTEN JOKE, YOU'LL BE CALLING UP MIKE PENCE, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE YOUR GOVERNOR OR YOUR VICE PRESIDENT OR WHO THE HELL KNOWS.
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CALL UP -- GOOD MAN.
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CALL HIM AND YOU COULD EITHER SAY, GOVERNOR, OR VICE PRESIDENT, SIR, PLEASE, PLEASE SPEAK TO MR. TRUMP.
WE'RE WINNING TOO MUCH.
WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA, CANNOT STAND ALL OF THESE VICTORIES.
WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
WE'RE NOT USED TO IT.
PLEASE, WE'RE WINNING WITH OUR MILITARY.
WE'RE GOING TO BEAT ISIS.
WE'RE WINNING ON TRADE.
WE'RE WINNING AT THE BORDER.
WE'RE STOPPING DRUGS FROM POURING IN.
WE'RE WINNING ON EDUCATION.
WE'RE WINNING WITH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.
PLEASE, PLEASE, MIKE, HELP US.
WE'RE WINNING TOO MUCH.
AND MIKE WILL COME TO SEE ME.
AND SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, SIR, THEY'RE WINNING TOO MUCH.
THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA CAN'T STAND IT.
I SAY, MIKE, GO BACK AND TELL THEM, WE'RE NOT CHANGING A DAMN THING.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING.
AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN AT EVERY LEVEL.
AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SO GREAT AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.
I LOVE YOU INDIANA.
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP.
YOU'RE REALLY SPECIAL PEOPLE.
THANK YOU.
WE LOVE YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

It is great to be here.
Id like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us.
Today, I am going to talk about how to Make America Wealthy Again.
We are thirty miles from Steel City.
Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation.
The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape.
But our workers loyalty was repaid with betrayal.
Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization  moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas.
Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy.
But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.
When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing.
For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment.
Many of these areas have still never recovered.
Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families.
Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away.
Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair.
This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class.
It doesnt have to be this way.
We can turn it all around  and we can turn it around fast.
But if were going to deliver real change, were going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.
The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything  and say anything  to keep things exactly as they are.
The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change.
The inner cities will remain poor.
The factories will remain closed.
The borders will remain open.
The special interests will remain firmly in control.
Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small  and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future.
READ: How Donald Trump Says Hed Win Americas Trade War
Top U.S. Labor Leader Blasts Donald Trump in Dueling Speeches
My campaign has the opposite message.
I want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again.
I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites whove led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another.
Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders.
I was on the right side of that issue  with the people  while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong.
Now its time for the American people to take back their future.
Thats the choice we face.
We can either give in to Hillary Clintons campaign of fear, or we can choose to Believe In America.
We lost our way when we stopped believing in our country.
America became the worlds dominant economy by becoming the worlds dominant producer.
The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known.
But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America, to promoting development in other nations.
We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable.
Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result.
I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.
Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.
This is not some natural disaster.
It is politician-made disaster.
It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism.
This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free.
Our Founding Fathers Understood Trade
George Washington said that the promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.
Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the expediency of encouraging manufactur[ing] in the United States.
The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that: The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government must produce want and ruin among our people.
Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax.
Instead, it had tariffs  emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production.
Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down.
We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free.
As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before.
Ladies and Gentlemen, its time to declare our economic independence once again.
That means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years.
America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997  even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people.
At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.
First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
Second, Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization.
NAFTA was the worst trade deal in history, and Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.
It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it.
It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for Chinas disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible agreement.
Then, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.
The city of Pittsburgh, and the State of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO.
Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time.
Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China.
It was also Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012.
As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs.
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton Voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.
Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back.
To understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper.
Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our Gross Domestic Product.
From 1947 to 2001  a span of over five decades  our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%.
However, since 2002  the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports  that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.
What does this mean for Americans?
For every one percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs.
Americas job creation deficit due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs  and thats just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages.
The Transpacific-Partnership is the greatest danger yet.
The TPP would be the death blow for American manufacturing.
It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own.
It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters.
It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets  while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports.
The TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas.
The TPP even created a backdoor for China to supply car parts for automobiles made in Mexico.
The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest wage countries on Earth.
Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence.
The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people cant veto.
These commissions are great Hillary Clintons Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes.
It should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the gold standard.
Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too  but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed.
She will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career.
Heres how it would go: she would make a small token change, declare the pact fixed, and ram it through.
Thats why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP in its current form,  ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity.
If the media doesnt believe me, I have a challenge for you.
Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form.
There is no way to fix the TPP.
We need bilateral trade deals.
We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.
A Trump Administration will change our failed trade policy  quickly
Here are 7 steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs.
One: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.
Two: Im going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.
Three: Im going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers.
I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses.
Four: Im going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers.
And I dont mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better.
If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.
Five: I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator.
Any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the United States will be met with sharply
Six: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO.
Chinas unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.
Seven: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry.
His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45% and his tariff to shield Americas semiconductor industry was 100%.
Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war.
She has it completely backwards.
Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another  from NAFTA to China to South Korea.
A Trump Administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people.
The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
A new era of prosperity will finally begin.
America will be independent once more.
Under a Trump Presidency, the American worker will finally have a President who will protect them and fight for them.
We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens an American job.
We will make America the best place in the world to start a business, hire workers, and open a factory.
This includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses.
We will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity.
Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world.
We are also going to fully capture Americas tremendous energy capacity.
This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit.
Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines.
A Trump Administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure.
Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State building.
It will be American steel that will fortify Americans crumbling bridges.
It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky.
It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities.
It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy  mined from American resources  that powers this country.
It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.
We are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country.
This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.
On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America First again.
We are going to make America wealthy again.
We are going to reject Hillary Clintons politics of fear, futility, and incompetence.
We are going to embrace the possibilities of change.
It is time to believe in the future.
It is time to believe in each other.
It is time to Believe In America.
This Is How We Are Going To Make America Great Again  For All Americans.
We Are Going To Make America Great Again For Everyone  Greater Than Ever Before.
Thank you.
SPEECH 1: President Trump’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress - Feb. 28, 2017

Thank you very much.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States — (applause) — and citizens of America:

Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation’s path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.
(Applause.)
Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.
(Applause.)
Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.
That torch is now in our hands.
And we will use it to light up the world.
I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
A new chapter — (applause) — of American Greatness is now beginning.
A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.
And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.
What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.
Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.
(Applause.)
All the nations of the world — friend or foe — will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.
In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding — 250 years since the day we declared our independence.
It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.
But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?
What kind of country will we leave for our children?
I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.
For too long, we’ve watched our middle class shrink as we’ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.
We’ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.
We’ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.
And we’ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet.
The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds — families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.
But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.
Because only then can we truly make America great again.
(Applause.)
Dying industries will come roaring back to life.
Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.
Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.
Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.
Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop.
And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.
(Applause.)
It’s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises.
Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.
(Applause.)
The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record.
We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic — and it is a fantastic — new F-35 jet fighter, and we’ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.
We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.
We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban — (applause) — thank you — and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.
We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency.
(Applause.)
And we’re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.
(Applause.)
We’re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.
(Applause.)
We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines — (applause) — thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.
And I’ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.
(Applause.)
We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
(Applause.)
And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
(Applause.)
To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.
I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.
(Applause.)
We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
(Applause.)
At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
(Applause.)
By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.
(Applause.)
We want all Americans to succeed, but that can’t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.
We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.
(Applause.)
For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.
(Applause.)
As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.
Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.
To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question:  What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?
(Applause.)
Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.
We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.
(Applause.)
According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.
We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.
We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world.
It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.
Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.
(Applause.)
Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.
We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
(Applause.)
That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm.
(Applause.)
As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs.
We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.
(Applause.)
I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.
(Applause.)
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.
(Applause.)
I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.
(Applause.)
Thank you, Maureen.
Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.
To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.
He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.
(Applause.)
Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.
Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.
Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.
More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.
We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.
In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.
We’ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we’ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.
And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.
It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.
But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy — making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.
(Applause.)
Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.
My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
(Applause.)
It will be a big, big cut.
At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.
We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.
We have to do it.
(Applause.)
Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes.
But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.
I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.
In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.
((Laughter and applause.)
And they wanted me to ride one and I said, “No, thank you.”  (Laughter.)
At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?
They said that it’s good.
I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?
They told me — without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they’ve become used to it — that it’s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.
They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
They weren’t even asking for a change.
But I am.
(Applause.)
I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.
It’s been a long time since we had fair trade.
The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the “abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… will produce want and ruin among our people.”  Lincoln was right — and it’s time we heeded his advice and his words.
(Applause.)
I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.
They have taken advantage of our country.
No longer.
(Applause.)
I am going to bring back millions of jobs.
Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.
(Applause.)
The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.
Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.
(Applause.)
It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.
Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.
According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.
Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.
It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class.
And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.
(Applause.)
I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals:  To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation’s security; and to restore respect for our laws.
If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
(Applause.)
Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program — the building of the Interstate Highway System.
The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.
(Applause.)
America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in theMiddle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.
With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country – twice.
And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.
To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States — financed through both public and private capital — creating millions of new jobs.
(Applause.)
This effort will be guided by two core principles:  buy American and hire American.
(Applause.)
Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare — (applause) — with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.
(Applause.)
Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.
(Applause.)
The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.
(Applause.)
Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.
As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.
Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State — it is unsustainable and collapsing.
One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast.
They are losing them so fast.
They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all.
There’s no choice left.
Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?
We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.
Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.
(Applause.)
Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.
So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
(Applause.)
Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:

First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.
(Applause.)
Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts — but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.
(Applause.)
Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.
(Applause.)
Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.
(Applause.)
And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines — (applause) — which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.
So important.
Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.
Every problem can be solved.
And every hurting family can find healing and hope.
Our citizens deserve this, and so much more — so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?
(Applause.)
On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.
(Applause.)
My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.
An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all.
Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.
(Applause.)
Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.
She was not expected to live past five.
On receiving this news, Megan’s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.
He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.
Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.
(Applause.)
Megan’s story is about the unbounded power of a father’s love for a daughter.
But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan’s life, from reaching those in need.
If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.
(Applause.)
In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.
But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child.
Education is the civil rights issue of our time.
(Applause.)
I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children.
(Applause.)
These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.
(Applause.)
Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.
As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.
But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning — a great learning center — with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.
Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.
Later this year she will get her master’s degree in social work.
We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.
(Applause.)
But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.
In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
This is not acceptable in our society.
(Applause.)
Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.
(Applause.)
But to create this future, we must work with, not against — not against — the men and women of law enforcement.
(Applause.)
We must build bridges of cooperation and trust — not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it’s what it is, division.
It’s pure, unadulterated division.
We have to unify.
Police and sheriffs are members of our community.
They’re friends and neighbors, they’re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters — and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they’ll come home safe and sound.
We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
(Applause.)
And we must support the victims of crime.
I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.
The office is called VOICE — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.
We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.
(Applause.)
Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.
Jamiel’s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.
Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.
But he never got the chance.
His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.
Jamiel, thank you.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.
Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California.
They were pillars of their community.
These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
Should have never been in our country.
Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.
Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.
(Applause.)
To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice.
Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.
We will always honor their memory.
(Applause.)
Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war — if they must — they have to fight and they only have to win.
(Applause.)
I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester — (applause) — and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.
Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.
(Applause.)
The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater.
And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.
(Applause.)
We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens.
Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.
(Applause.)
I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that — and I quote — “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.”  Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
And Ryan is looking down, right now — you know that — and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.
(Laughter and applause.)
For as the Bible teaches us, “There is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom.
And we will never forget Ryan.
(Applause.)
To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.
Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.
It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.
We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism.
(Applause.)
But our partners must meet their financial obligations.
And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.
In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in.
Very nice.
(Applause.)
We expect our partners — whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific — to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.
Have to do that.
We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.
(Applause.)
Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
My job is not to represent the world.
My job is to represent the United States of America.
(Applause.)
But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.
We must learn from the mistakes of the past.
We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world — all across the world.
The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.
(Applause.)
America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.
We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.
We want peace, wherever peace can be found.
America is friends today with former enemies.
Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.
This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.
Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.
On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America’s centennial.
At that celebration, the country’s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.
Remington unveiled the first typewriter.
An early attempt was made at electric light.
Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.
Imagine the wonders our country could know in America’s 250th year.
(Applause.)
Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.
Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.
Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.
And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.
(Applause.)
When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before — for all Americans.
This is our vision.
This is our mission.
But we can only get there together.
We are one people, with one destiny.
We all bleed the same blood.
We all salute the same great American flag.
And we all are made by the same God.
(Applause.)
When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.
The time for small thinking is over.
The time for trivial fights is behind us.
We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.
From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country.
I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.
Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.
(Applause.)
SPEECH 2: Remarks by President Trump on Iran - Jan. 8, 2020

THE PRESIDENT:  As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.
Good morning.
I’m pleased to inform you: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy no Americans were harmed in last night’s attack by the Iranian regime.
We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases.
Our great American forces are prepared for anything.
Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.
No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.
I salute the incredible skill and courage of America’s men and women in uniform.
For far too long — all the way back to 1979, to be exact — nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond.
Those days are over.
Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world.
We will never let that happen.
Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives.
At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.
As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities.
He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets.
He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region.
He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims.
Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him.
Soleimani’s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood.
He should have been terminated long ago.
By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people.
As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime.
These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.
In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones.
Iran’s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash.
Instead of saying “thank you” to the United States, they chanted “death to America.”  In fact, they chanted “death to America” the day the agreement was signed.
Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration.
The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran.
The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.
Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism.
The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality.
They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal -– or JCPOA –- and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place.
We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential.
Iran can be a great country.
Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war.
The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer.
It will not be allowed to go forward.
Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.
Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence.
These historic accompliments [accomplishments] changed our strategic priorities.
These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible.
And options in the Middle East became available.
We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil.
The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration, at a cost of $2.5 trillion.
U.S. Armed Forces are stronger than ever before.
Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast.
Under construction are many hypersonic missiles.
The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it.
We do not want to use it.
American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.
Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way.
He was a monster.
Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate, and failed.
Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration.
ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran.
The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities.
Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future — one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world.
The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.
I want to thank you, and God bless America.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
SPEECH 3: State of the Union Address - Feb. 5, 2019

THE PRESIDENT:  Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States — (applause) — and my fellow Americans:

We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.
As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.
Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.
(Applause.)
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.
It’s the agenda of the American people.
Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first.
There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage, together, to seize it.
(Applause.)
Victory is not winning for our party.
Victory is winning for our country.
(Applause.)
This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission and the power of American pride.
In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the “Great Crusade” — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.
(Applause.)
On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.
Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.
(Applause.)
Please.
Gentlemen, we salute you.
In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.
Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin.
(Applause.)
Thank you, Buzz.
This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.
(Applause.)
In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and, when you get down to it, there’s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America.
(Applause.)
Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.
An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.
We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.
(Applause.)
But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.
(Applause.)
Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.
We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.
The decision is ours to make.
We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.
(Applause.)
Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.
In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before.
There’s been nothing like it.
We have created 5.3 million new jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do.
But the fact is, we are just getting started.
(Applause.)
Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for.
They’re growing faster than anyone else thought possible.
Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.
(Applause.)
The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office.
And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy anywhere in the world.
Not even close.
(Applause.)
Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.
(Applause.)
African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.
(Applause.)
Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.
(Applause.)
More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country — 157 million people at work.
(Applause.)
We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.
(Applause.)
We virtually ended the estate tax — or death tax, as it is often called — on small businesses for ranchers and also for family farms.
(Applause.)
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty.
(Applause.)
And to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly, Right to Try.
(Applause.)
My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.
(Applause.)
Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
(Applause.)
And we have unleashed a revolution in American energy.
The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
(Applause.)
And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.
(Applause.)
After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and America — (applause) — America is again winning each and every day.
(Applause.)
Members of Congress: The state of our union is strong.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  That sounds so good.
(Laughter.)
Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double the number expected.
(Applause.)
An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.
(Applause.)
If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.
It just doesn’t work that way.
We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.
This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate.
In some cases, years and years waiting.
Not right.
(Applause.)
The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country.
Now is the time for bipartisan action.
Believe it or not, we have already proven that that’s possible.
In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms.
And after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.
(Applause.)
And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.
They said it couldn’t be done.
(Applause.)
Last year, I heard, through friends, the story of Alice Johnson.
I was deeply moved.
In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.
Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.
She had a big impact on that prison population, and far beyond.
Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing, and the need to remedy this total injustice.
She served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.
In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence.
When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did something right.
Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific woman.
Terrific.
Alice, please.
(Applause.)
Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.
Thank you very much, Alice.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the FIRST STEP Act into law.
Big deal.
(Applause.)
It’s a big deal.
This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.
The FIRST STEP Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.
Now states across the country are following our lead.
America is a nation that believes in redemption.
We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.
In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses.
Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates.
Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the FIRST STEP Act.
(Applause.)
Matthew, please.
Thank you, Matthew.
Welcome home.
(Applause.)
Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border.
Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.
(Applause.)
As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.
We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.
I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught.
This is a moral issue.
The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial wellbeing of all America.
We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.
This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws.
Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.
(Applause.)
I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.
(Applause.)
Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.
Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls, and gates, and guards.
(Applause.)
Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel.
(Applause.)
One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.
Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border.
Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.
We are removing these gang members by the thousands.
But until we secure our border, they’re going to keep streaming right back in.
Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.
I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads, and families.
No one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell.
Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien.
They were in their eighties, and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.
Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand.
Few can understand your pain.
Thank you.
And thank you for being here.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again.
Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders.
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.
When Elvin — (applause) — thank you.
When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.
At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.
Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.
Elvin says that, “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve [really] done my job.”  Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
(Applause.)
Thank you, Elvin.
We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border.
It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.
In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built.
I will get it built.
(Applause.)
This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall.
It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need.
And these agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.
(Applause.)
San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country.
In response, a strong security wall was put in place.
This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
The border city of El Paso, Texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities.
Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.
Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.
(Applause.)
So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.
No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.
(Applause.)
You weren’t supposed to do that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.
(Applause.)
Don’t sit yet.
You’re going to like this.
(Laughter.)
And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.
Really great.
And congratulations.
That’s great.
As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first-ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.
To build on — (applause) — thank you.
To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.
So bad.
We are now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.
(Applause.)
Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.
But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.
I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.
But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.
I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA.
For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.
Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven’t had delivered to for a long time.
I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: “Made in the USA.”  (Applause.)
Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us.
(Applause.)
Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.
(Applause.)
I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting-edge industries of the future.
This is not an option.
This is a necessity.
The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and to protect patients with preexisting conditions.
(Applause.)
Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
(Applause.)
But we must do more.
It’s unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.
This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it — and we’ll stop it fast.
(Applause.)
I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally.
(Applause.)
We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.
(Applause.)
No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.
In recent years — (applause) — in recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.
Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.
My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.
We have made incredible strides.
Incredible.
(Applause.)
Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.
(Applause.)
Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.
(Applause.)
Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline.
Every birthday — (applause) — hi, Grace.
(Laughter.)
Every birthday since she was four, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital.
She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself.
That’s what happened.
Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Immediately, she began radiation treatment.
At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer.
(Applause.)
When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered — they loved her; they still love her — with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: “Last day of chemo.”  (Applause.)
Thank you very much, Grace.
You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room.
Thank you very much.
Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.
My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.
To help support working parents, the time has come to pass School Choice for Americans’ children.
(Applause.)
I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.
(Applause.)
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.
Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.
These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.
And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.
To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.
(Applause.)
Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.
(Applause.)
And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.
Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.
We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.
(Applause.)
Finally.
Finally.
For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO.
But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO Allies.
(Applause.)
They said it couldn’t be done.
As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.
Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.
For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability.
While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.
It’s been going on for many years.
That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.
Perhaps — (applause) — we really have no choice.
Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t — in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.
(Applause.)
As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.
Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months.
If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.
(Applause.)
Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.
Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27th and 28th in Vietnam.
(Applause.)
Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela — (applause) — and its new President, Juan Guaidó.
(Applause.)
We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.
(Applause.)
Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.
AUDIENCE:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.
(Applause.)
We are born free and we will stay free.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have for many years, is in the Middle East.
Our approach is based on principled realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.
For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel, and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
(Applause.)
Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.
In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.
More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.
We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.
As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach.
Great nations do not fight endless wars.
(Applause.)
When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria — just two years ago.
Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.
Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.
I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach — if possible — a political settlement in Afghanistan.
The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating.
Our troops have fought with unmatched valor.
And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict.
(Applause.)
In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.
As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop’s presence and focus on counterterrorism.
And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.
We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.
And the other side would like to do the same thing.
It’s time.
(Applause.)
Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation’s power and will to defend our people.
Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USS Cole.
And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack.
(Applause.)
We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost.
Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.
(Applause.)
Thank you, Tom.
My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.
It is a radical regime.
They do bad, bad things.
To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.
(Applause.)
And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country.
We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants “Death to America” and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.
(Applause.)
We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.
With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.
And he was very successful.
Timothy has just had his 12th surgery, and he is going in for many more.
But he made the trip to be here with us tonight.
Officer Matson, please.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
We are forever grateful.
Thank you very much.
Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet.
He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.
But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps.
Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  (Sings “Happy Birthday.”)  (Applause.)
MR. SAMET:  Thank you!
THE PRESIDENT:  They wouldn’t do that for me, Judah.
(Laughter.)
Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp.
Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt.
A soldier appeared.
Judah’s family braced for the absolute worst.
Then, his father cried out with joy, “It’s the Americans!
It’s the Americans!”  (Applause.)
Thank you.
A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau.
He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.
“To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.”  They came down from Heaven.
I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War.
One of them was Herman Zeitchik.
But there is more to Herman’s story.
A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.
(Applause.)
He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.
Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.
Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.
They did not know if they would survive the hour.
They did not know if they would grow old.
But they knew that America had to prevail.
Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn.
Why did they do it?
They did it for America.
They did it for us.
Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
Think of this Capitol.
Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.
Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.
You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.
Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.
What will we do with this moment?
How will we be remembered?
I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us.
Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.
Our most exciting journeys still await.
Our biggest victories are still to come.
We have not yet begun to dream.
We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.
We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.
We do the incredible.
We defy the impossible.
We conquer the unknown.
This is the time to reignite the American imagination.
This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.
This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make.
I am asking you to choose greatness.
No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.
We must keep America first in our hearts.
We must keep freedom alive in our souls.
And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise, and the light and the glory, among all the nations of the world.
Thank you.
God bless you.
And God bless America.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
SPEECH 4: Remarks by President Trump at the World Economic Forum - Jan. 26, 2018

Thank you, Klaus, very much.
It’s a privilege to be here at this forum where leaders in business, science, art, diplomacy, and world affairs have gathered for many, many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity, security, and peace.
I’m here today to represent the interests of the American people and to affirm America’s friendship and partnership in building a better world.
Like all nations represented at this great forum, America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper, and every child can grow up free from violence, poverty, and fear.
Over the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S.  We’re lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream — the dream of a great job, a safe home, and a better life for their children.
After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth.
The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election.
Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades.
Since my election, we’ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially.
Small-business optimism is at an all-time high.
New unemployment claims are near the lowest we’ve seen in almost half a century.
African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans.
The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.
I’m here to deliver a simple message:  There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States.
America is open for business, and we are competitive once again.
The American economy is by far the largest in the world, and we’ve just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history.
We’ve massively cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard-earned money.
We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 21 percent.
As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000.
The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American’s household income by more than $4,000.
The world’s largest company, Apple, announced plans to bring $245 billion in overseas profits home to America.
Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years.
Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States.
This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceived.
Regulation is stealth taxation.
The U.S., like many other countries, unelected bureaucrats — and we have — believe me, we have them all over the place — and they’ve imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability.
In America, those days are over.
I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for every one new regulation.
We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations.
Instead of 2 for 1, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every 1 new rule.
We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before.
We are creating an environment that attracts capital, invites investment, and rewards production.
America is the place to do business.
So come to America, where you can innovate, create, and build.
I believe in America.
As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also.
But America first does not mean America alone.
When the United States grows, so does the world.
American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe, and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives.
As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly shared prosperity and rewards to those who play by the rules.
We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others.
We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.
Because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all.
The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning.
These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers, not just in the U.S., but around the globe.
Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as President of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers.
We will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to our trading system.
Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S. but for all nations.
As I have said, the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries.
This will include the countries in TPP, which are very important.
We have agreements with several of them already.
We would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all.
My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independence.
We are lifting self-imposed restrictions on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizens and businesses, and to promote energy security for our friends all around the world.
No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy.
America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America.
We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.
We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.
We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable.
And we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.
We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world.
Energy is abundant and affordable.
There has never been a better time to come to America.
We are also making historic investments in the American military because we cannot have prosperity without security.
To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations.
Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share.
My administration is proud to have led historic efforts, at the United Nations Security Council and all around the world, to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean Peninsula.
We continue to call on partners to confront Iran’s support for terrorists and block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon.
We’re also working with allies and partners to destroy jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS, and very successfully so.
The United States is leading a very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding, and to discredit their wicked ideology.
I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.
There is still more fighting and work to be done and to consolidate our gains.
We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations.
I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts.
You are not just securing your own citizens, but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people.
When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation.
We will defend our citizens and our borders.
We are also securing our immigration system, as a matter of both national and economic security.
America is a cutting-edge economy, but our immigration system is stuck in the past.
We must replace our current system of extended-family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy, to support themselves financially, and to strengthen our country.
In rebuilding America, we are also fully committed to developing our workforce.
We are lifting people from dependence to independence, because we know the single best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck.
To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy.
We must invest in our people.
When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured.
Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all.
The nation’s greatness is more than the sum of its production.
A nation’s greatness is the sum of its citizens:  the values, pride, love, devotion, and character of the people who call that nation home.
From my first international G7 Summit, to the G20, to the U.N. General Assembly, to APEC, to the World Trade Organization, and today at the World Economic Forum, my administration has not only been present, but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free, sovereign nations cooperate toward shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams.
Represented in this room are some of the remarkable citizens from all over the world.
You are national leaders, business titans, industry giants, and many of the brightest minds in many fields.
Each of you has the power to change hearts, transform lives, and shape your countries’ destinies.
With this power comes an obligation, however — a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, and customers who have made you who you are.
So together, let us resolve to use our power, our resources, and our voices, not just for ourselves, but for our people — to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes, and to empower their dreams; to protect their families, their communities, their histories, and their futures.
That’s what we’re doing in America, and the results are totally unmistakable.
It’s why new businesses and investment are flooding in.
It’s why our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in so many decades.
It’s why America’s future has never been brighter.
Today, I am inviting all of you to become part of this incredible future we are building together.
Thank you to our hosts, thank you to the leaders and innovators in the audience.
But most importantly, thank you to all of the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day, making this a better world for everyone.
Together, let us send our love and our gratitude to make them, because they really make our countries run.
They make our countries great.
Thank you, and God bless you all.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
Thank you very much.
MR. SCHWAB:  Thank you, Mr. President, for this inspiring speech.
As it is tradition at the forum, I will ask you one or two questions.
And my first question is, why is the tax reform — why has it been of such a high priority for your administration?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you.
This is an incredible group of people.
We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom I’ve read about for years.
And it was truly an incredible group.
But I think I have 15 new friends.
So this has been really great what you’ve done and putting it together, the economic forum.
The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they weren’t able to get it done.
Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform.
And ours is cutting and reforming.
We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important.
We’ve wanted to do it.
It is very tough, politically, to do it.
Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough.
That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years.
And once we got it going, it was going.
And the big — and I wouldn’t say a total surprise, but one of the big things that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out very early and they said they were going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies.
And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.
And even today they just announced many more.
But every day they announce more and more.
And now it’s a fight for who’s going to give the most.
It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000.
This is something that we didn’t anticipate.
Oftentimes in business, things happen that you don’t anticipate.
Usually that’s a bad thing, but this was a good thing.
This came out of nowhere.
Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.
It wasn’t in the equation.
We waited — we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in.
And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck — because it’s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing.
And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be — well, we haven’t even gotten there yet and it’s kicked in.
And it’s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices.
We’ve set 84 records since my election — record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period.
And that’s a great thing.
And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform.
So what happened is really something special.
Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion.
And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that we’ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S.  And I will tell you, this moved up very substantially.
But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking — I thought they were talking $350 million.
And, by the way, that’s a nice-sized plant.
Not the greatest, but not bad.
And they said, “No, sir.
It’s $350 billion.”  I said, that is something.
Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night — great companies.
They’re all investing.
When one of the gentlemen said he’s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, “Wow, he’s actually the cheap one in the group” — because they’re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars.
So I think you have a brand-new United States.
You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening.
And I just want to finish by — I have a group of people that have been so — I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them.
But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.
And we’re really doing — we had a great first year — so successful in so many different ways.
And there’s a tremendous spirit.
When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this.
Same with Hispanic.
Women at a 17-year low.
It’s very heartwarming to see.
But there’s a tremendous spirit in the United States.
I would say it’s a spirit like I have never witnessed before.
I’ve been here for awhile.
I have never witnessed the spirit that our country has right now.
So I just want to thank you all, and all those that are pouring billions of dollars into our country, or ten dollars into our country, we thank you very much.
Thank you.
MR. SCHWAB:  Mr. President, I will ask you, maybe, a personal question.
But before doing so, I’d just like to —

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sounds very interesting.
MR. SCHWAB: — acknowledge that —

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I didn’t know about this one.
MR. SCHWAB:  I would like to acknowledge the strong presence of your Cabinet members

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.
MR. SCHWAB: — who tremendously contributed to the discussions the last (inaudible).
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Good, I would like to do that.
That’s very nice.
MR. SCHWAB:  Yeah.
Now —

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Steven, Wilbur, Gary, Robert, even my General and my various other generals, you know.
We’re making our military protection a little bit better for us too.
So thank you very much.
Does everybody understand that?
I think so.
Thank you all for being here.
MR. SCHWAB:  Now my, maybe personal, question would be: What experience from your past have been most useful in preparing you for the Presidency?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, being a businessman has been a great experience for me.
I’ve loved it.
I’ve always loved business.
I’ve always been good at building things, and I’ve always been successful at making money.
I’d buy things that would fail –that would be failures — and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful.
And I’ve been good at it.
And that takes a certain ability.
And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President.
It’s always been a general or a politician.
Throughout history, it’s always been a general — you had to be a general — but mostly it was politicians.
You never have a businessman.
And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.
That’s where we were heading.
I really believe that — because they were going to put on massive new regulations.
You couldn’t breathe.
It was choking our country to death.
And I was able to see that, Klaus, as a businessperson.
The other thing is, I’ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media.
(Laughter.)
Throughout my whole life — somebody will explain someday why — but I’ve always gotten a lot.
(Laughter.)
And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press.
The numbers speak and things happen, but I’ve always really had a very good press.
And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be.
As the cameras start going off in the background.
(Laughter.)
But overall — I mean, the bottom line — somebody said, well, they couldn’t have been that bad because here we are — we’re President.
And I think we’re doing a really great job with my team.
I have a team of just tremendous people, and I think we’re doing a very special job.
And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I don’t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people.
We have a very pro-business group.
We have regulations cut to a level — in the history of our country, Klaus — this was reported recently.
In one year we’ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case.
We’ve cut more regulations in one year, and we have a ways to go.
I mean, we’re probably 50 percent done.
And we’re going to have regulation.
There’s nothing wrong with rules and regulations; you need them.
But we’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go.
So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, we’ve really done something.
And one other thing I said — and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople — I think I’ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, it’s just not going to work.
And the reason I’m a cheerleader is because it’s easy — because I love our country and I think we’re just doing really well.
And we look forward to seeing you in America — special place — and where you are is a special place also.
Thank you all very much.
I appreciate it.
(Applause.)
MR. SCHWAB:  Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for being with us.
The World Economic Forum community, who is assembled here, will be certainly — and I quote you from the last piece of your remarks — will be certainly among “the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day making this world a better place for everyone.”

Thank you very much for being with us.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you.
SPEECH 5: Remarks by the President in Nashville, Tennessee - March 15, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
So we’re just going to let the other folks come in, fill it up.
This is some crowd.
You have to see what’s outside, you wouldn’t even believe it.
(Applause.)
Unbelievable.
So I’m thrilled to be here in Nashville, Tennessee, the home — (applause) — of country music, Southern hospitality, and the great President Andrew Jackson.
(Applause.)
I just came from a tour of Andrew Jackson’s home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth.
Jackson’s life was devoted to one very crucial principle — he understood that real leadership means putting America first.
(Applause.)
Before becoming President, Andrew Jackson served your state from the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and he also served as commander of the Tennessee militia.
Tough cookie.
Tough cookie.
(Applause.)
So let’s begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the United States military and all of our wonderful veterans.
The veterans.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  Amazing.
There’s no place I’d rather be than with all of you here tonight, with the wonderful, hardworking citizens of our country.
(Applause.)
I would much rather spend time with you than any of the pundits, consultants, or special interests, certainly — or reporters from Washington, D.C.
(Applause.)
It’s patriotic Americans like you who make this country run, and run well.
You pay your taxes, follow our laws, support your communities, raise your children, love your country, and send your bravest to fight in our wars.
(Applause.)
All you want is a government that shows you the same loyalty in return.
It’s time that Washington heard your voice — and believe me, on November 8th, they heard your voice.
(Applause.)
The forgotten men and women of our country will never be forgotten again, believe me.
(Applause.)
I want to thank so many of your state leaders — State Party Chairman Scott Golden; Congressman Scott DesJarlais; Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn; Congresswoman Diane Black; Congressman Jimmy Duncan — right from the beginning.
(Applause.)
Governor Bill Haslam.
(Applause.)
A great friend of mine, Senator Bob Corker.
(Applause.)
An incredible guy, respected by all — Senator Lamar Alexander.
(Applause.)
And so many more.
Thank you all for being here.
We’re going to be working closely together to deliver for you, the citizens of Tennessee, like you’ve never been delivered for before.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
We’re going to reduce your taxes — big league.
Big.
(Applause.)
Big.
I want to start that process so quickly.
Got to get the healthcare done.
We got to start the tax reductions.
(Applause.)
We are going to enforce our trade rules and bring back our jobs, which are scattered all over the world.
They’re coming back to our country.
(Applause.)
We’re going to support the amazing — absolutely amazing men and women of law enforcement.
(Applause.)
Protect your freedoms, and defend the Second Amendment.
(Applause.)
And we are going to restore respect for our country and for its great and very beautiful flag.
(Applause.)
It’s been a little over 50 days since my inauguration, and we’ve been putting our America First agenda very much into action.
You see what’s happening.
We’re keeping our promises.
In fact, they have signs — “He’s Kept His Promise.”  They’re all over the place.
I have.
(Applause.)
We have done far more — I think maybe more than anybody’s done in this office in 50 days, that I could tell you.
(Applause.)
And we have just gotten started.
Wait until you see what’s coming, folks.
We’ve appointed a Supreme Court justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia.
His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.
(Applause.)
He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy — and I mean bloated — while protecting our national security.
You see what we’re doing with our military — bigger, better, stronger than ever before.
You see what’s happening.
(Applause.)
And you’re already seeing the results.
Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.
(Applause.)
We believe — especially the people in Tennessee, I know you people so well — (applause) — in peace through strength.
That’s what we’re going to have.
And we are taking steps to make sure that our allies pay their fair share.
They have to pay.
(Applause.)
We’ve begun a dramatic effort to eliminate job-killing federal regulations like nobody has ever seen before — slash, slash.
We’re going to protect the environment, we’re going to protect people’s safeties, but, let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and we’re going to bring it down to where it should be.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, let’s go.
One person — and they’ll be the story tomorrow — did you hear there was a protestor?
(Applause.)
We’re going to put our miners back to work.
We’re going to put our auto industry back to work.
Already because of this new business climate, we are creating jobs that are starting to pour back into our country like we haven’t seen in many, many decades.
(Applause.)
In the first two job reports since I took the oath of office, we’ve already added nearly half a million new jobs, and believe me, it’s just beginning.
(Applause.)
I’ve already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.
(Applause.)
A lot of jobs.
I’ve also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with American steel.
(Applause.)
They want to build them here, they use our steel.
We believe in two simple rules:  Buy American and Hire American.
(Applause.)
On trade, I’ve kept my promise to the American people, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster.
(Applause.)
Tennessee has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the institution of NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever in history.
Our nation has lost over 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization — 60,000.
Think of that.
More than that.
We’re not going to let it happen anymore.
From now on, we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies.
(Applause.)
And if America does what it says, and if your President does what I’ve been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks.
Not even close.
(Applause.)
If a company wants to leave America, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences.
(Applause.)
That’s what we have borders for.
And by the way, aren’t our borders getting extremely strong?
(Applause.)
Very strong.
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  Don’t even think about it.
We will build the wall.
Don’t even think about it.
(Applause.)
In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid.
We had hundreds of bidders.
Everybody wants to build our wall.
(Applause.)
Usually, that means we’re going to get a good price.
We’re going to get a good price, believe me.
(Applause.)
We’re going to build the wall.
Some of the fake news said, I don’t think Donald Trump wants to build the wall.
Can you imagine if I said we’re not going to build a wall?
Fake news.
Fake, fake news.
Fake news, folks.
A lot of fake.
No, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are.
It’s under design, and you’re going to see some very good things happening.
But the border by itself right now is doing very well.
It’s becoming very strong.
General Kelly has done a great job — General Kelly.
My administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States.
Our southern border will be protected always.
It will have the wall.
Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon.
You’re already seeing what’s going on.
The drugs are pouring into our country, folks.
They are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and we’re going to stop it.
We’re not going to playing games.
Not going to be playing games.
(Applause.)
Following my executive action — and don’t forget, we’ve only been here for like — what?
— 50 days — we’ve already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day — 61 percent.
Think about it.
And now people are saying, we’re not going to go there anymore because we can’t get in.
So it’s going to get better and better.
We got to stop those drugs, though.
We got to stop those drugs.
During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws.
These American victims were ignored by the media.
They were ignored by Washington.
But they were not ignored by me, and they’re not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer.
Not going to happen.
(Applause.)
As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens.
One by one — you’re reading about it, right?
They’re being thrown out of our country.
They’re being thrown into prisons.
And we will not let them back in.
(Applause.)
We’re also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism.
(Applause.)
We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino — hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts.
Right now we have investigations going on all over — hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons.
We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS.
For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.
(Applause.)
But let me give you the bad news.
We don’t like bad news, right?
I don’t want to hear — and I’ll turn it into good.
But let me give you the bad, the sad news.
Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii — part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court — and I have to be nice; otherwise I’ll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.
I’ll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world — I will be criticized — I’ll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.
I would never want to do that.
A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.
AUDIENCE:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.
This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit’s — in my opinion — flawed ruling.
This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.
The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems — or she — or she.
Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.
(Applause.)
When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.
So we have a lot of lawyers here.
We also have a lot of smart people here.
Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration — and you know what I’m talking about, right?
Can I read this to you?
Listen to this.
Now, we’re all smart people.
We’re all good students — some are bad students, but even if you’re a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.
Ready?
So here’s the statute — which they don’t even want to quote when they overrule it.
And it was put here for the security of our country.
And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.
And sometimes we need it very badly for security — security of our country.
It says — now, listen how easy this is.
“Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he — see, it wasn’t politically correct, because it should say he or she.
You know, today they’d say that.
Actually, that’s the only mistake they made.
“as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate.”  In other words, if he thinks there’s danger out there, he or she — whoever is President — can say, I’m sorry, folks, not now, please.
We’ve got enough problems.
(Applause.)
We’re talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people.
(Applause.)
Now, I know you people aren’t skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee.
Right?
Nobody — not Tennessee.
You don’t think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you?
No.
AUDIENCE:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  This ruling makes us look weak — which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me.
(Applause.)
Just look at our borders.
We’re going to fight this terrible ruling.
We’re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.
(Applause.)
We’re going to win.
We’re going to keep our citizens safe.
And regardless, we’re going to keep our citizens safe, believe me.
(Applause.)
Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz —- good lawyer — just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.
(Applause.)
Remember this, I wasn’t thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let’s tailor it.
This is a watered–down version of the first one.
This is a watered–down version.
And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one.
(Applause.)
The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.
I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless.
(Applause.)
And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me.
Not today, not ever.
We’re going to win it.
We’re going to win it.
(Applause.)
We’re going to apply common sense.
We’re going to apply intelligence.
And we’re never quitting, and we’re never going away, and we’re never, ever giving up.
The best way to keep foreign terrorists — or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists — from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place.
(Applause.)
We’ll take it, but these are the problems we have.
People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit.
And I’ll tell you what, that 9th Circuit — you have to see.
Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.
Take a look.
And this is what we have to live with.
Finally, I want to get to taxes.
I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but — (applause) — but before I can do that — I would have loved to have put it first, I’ll be honest — there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.
(Applause.)
If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you’re down to practically no insurers.
You’re going to have nobody.
You’re going to have nobody.
And this is true all over.
The insurers are fleeing.
The insurers are fleeing.
It’s a catastrophic situation, and there’s nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won’t be around for a year or two.
It’s gone.
So it’s not like, oh, gee, they have this.
Obamacare is gone.
Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.
It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs.
Remember all of the broken promises?
You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
Remember the wise guy — remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people — the so–called architect — the American people are stupid because they approved it?
We’re going to show them.
Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare.
(Applause.)
And remember this — remember this:  If we took, because there’s such divisiveness — and I’m not just talking now, with me.
There was with Obama.
There was with Bush.
The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.
I remember years ago, I’d go to Washington — I* was always very politically active — and Republicans and Democrats, they’d fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.
Today, there’s a level that nobody has seen before.
Just remember this:  If we submitted the Democrats’ plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn’t get one vote from the Democrats.
That’s the way it is.
That’s how much divisiveness and other things there are.
So it’s a problem.
But we’re going to get it by.
So, I’ve met with so many victims of Obamacare —- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation.
At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw — the government forcing people to buy a government–approved product.
There are very few people — very few people.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  By the way — watch what happens.
Now you just booed Obamacare.
They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned — they’re bad people, folks.
They’re bad people.
AUDIENCE:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  Tonight, I’ll go home, I’ll turn on, I’ll say — listen, I’ll turn on that television.
My wife will say, darling, it’s too bad you got booed.
I said, I didn’t get booed.
This was a — I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare.
Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed.
But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it.
So we’ll see.
It’s the fake, fake media.
We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.
(Applause.)
The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we’re going to arbitrate, we’re going to all get together and we’re going to get something done.
Remember this — if we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.
They won’t vote, no matter what we do, they’re not going to vote.
So we’re doing it a different way, a complex way.
It’s fine.
The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three — it’s going to be great.
It’s going to be great.
And then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like.
(Applause.)
The House legislation does so much for you.
It gives the states Medicaid flexibility.
And some of the states will take over their healthcare.
Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money — they run a great plan.
We have states that are doing great.
It gives great flexibility.
Thank you, folks.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes.
It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs.
The bill that I will ultimately sign — and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we’re going to get it done — we’ll get rid of Obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family.
(Applause.)
And once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three — I’m going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process.
(Applause.)
We welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and we’re going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day — unlike the way Obamacare was passed.
Remember, folks, if we don’t do anything, Obamacare is gone.
It’s not like, oh, gee, it’s going to be wonderful in three years.
It’s gone.
It’s gone.
It’s gone.
Not working.
It’s gone.
What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who don’t believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions.
(Applause.)
I am very confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country — not just on healthcare, but all across our government.
We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine.
We will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values.
(Applause.)
We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, we’re going to lower taxes.
(Applause.)
And we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing.
(Applause.)
No matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home.
We all salute the same flag.
And we all are made by the same God.
(Applause.)
AUDIENCE:  USA!
USA!
USA!
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s time to embrace our glorious American destiny.
Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country.
All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls.
And we found that out very recently in our last election — a lot of pride.
(Applause.)
We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us.
The future belongs to all of you.
This is your moment.
This is your time.
This is the hour when history is made.
All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make America strong again.
(Applause.)
We will make America wealthy again.
We will make America proud again.
We will make America safe again.
And we will make America great again.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
God bless you.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
God bless you, everybody.
SPEECH 6: President Donald J. Trump Inaugural Address - Jan. 20, 2017

Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.
We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.
Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
We will face challenges.
We will confront hardships.
But we will get the job done.
Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
They have been magnificent.
Thank you.
Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.
Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.
The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.
It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
This is your day.
This is your celebration.
And this, the United States of America, is your country.
What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
Everyone is listening to you now.
You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.
At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
These are the just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
We are one nation – and their pain is our pain.
Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.
We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry.
Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own.
And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers left behind.
The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
But that is the past.
And now we are looking only to the future.
We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
From this moment on, it’s going to be only America First.
America First.
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.
America will start winning again, winning like never before.
We will bring back our jobs.
We will bring back our borders.
We will bring back our wealth.
And we will bring back our dreams.
We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.
We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.
We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example — we will shine — for everyone to follow.
We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.
At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”

We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.
We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we will be protected by God.
Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.
The time for empty talk is over.
Now arrives the hour of action.
Do not allow anyone to tell you it cannot be done.
No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
We will not fail.
Our country will thrive and prosper again.
We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.
A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.
So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again.
Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny.
And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
Together, We will make America strong again.
We will make America wealthy again.
We will make America proud again.
We will make America safe again.
And, yes, together, we will make America great again.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
Thank you.
God bless America.
SPEECH 7: Donald Trump Speech in Miami - Sept. 16, 2016

Welcome to all of you deplorables.
Thank you, ma’am.
Boy, oh boy.
We’re going to have a good time tonight.
We’re going to have a good time.
Wow.
I love that.
I love that.
Look at this.
Look what that says.
Hold up that sign for the cameras.
Wow.
That’s so beautiful.
Thank you.
Great.
Thank you.
That is so nice.
And we are doing well in every way.
The polls have been incredible.
But we’re doing great.
It’s great to be in my second home — Florida.
And in the city of Miami, where I have so many wonderful friends and projects and employees.
We have an amazing group.
And all of you know Trump National Doral and we’ll go there.
Let’s go and have some fun.
We have tremendous developments in Miami on the water and Doral in particular has been a tremendous, tremendous thing.
So I really appreciate it.
I love this city.
I love the whole state.
So, and I have a lot of employees.
And I’m paying them a lot of money.
And, by the way, a lot of African-American employees, a lot of Hispanic employees.
A lot.
And they’re very happy.
They like Donald Trump.
So new polls have just come in.
And we’re leading in many of the battleground states all over the country.
Including being 4 points up in a certain state known as Florida.
And the Los Angeles Times has us 6 points up nationwide.
Good poll.
If it weren’t, I wouldn’t be telling you about it, I promise.
But come Nov. 8, we’re going to win Florida, and we’re going to win the White House, and we’re going to make America great again.
It’s going to be a victory for the people.
It’s going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the veterans.
The veterans — we love our veterans.
And every citizen of this country.
It’s going to be a victory for those who haven’t had reason to hope for a very long time.
I’m campaigning in every community, every part of this country for every last vote.
I’m running to be a president for all Americans.
I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti.
Good place.
Unbelievable people.
And I’m going to be campaigning hard for their votes.
And they are incredible people.
Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life — all.
All of them.
And, by the way, at Little Haiti they presented me with something that I figured I’d put on.
Is that OK to put it on?
They gave me that and I love it.
I think it’s great.
Your cops and soldiers — thank you.
I love you too.
Carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, Black, white and Hispanic.
But above all, we are together and we are Americans.
We got to pull our country together.
Just today I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor, brave people.
And many, many of our most amazing military leaders, generals, admirals, amazing people, real fighters.
They really know what they’re doing.
We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and admirals.
I didn’t know we had that many.
Well, we love them.
We also have the support of 16,500 border patrol officers.
The first time in the history of the border patrol that they’ve endorsed any presidential candidate.
As well as law enforcement officers, police, all across the country.
In fact, I’m very excited to announce tonight that we just received a few minutes ago the endorsement of the largest police union in the country, the Fraternal Order of Police.
Number one by far.
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
And we have the support of millions of patriotic moms and dads who go to work every day and make our country run.
While my opponent slanders you as deplorable — and irredeemable!
Boy that second word is tough.
You don’t hear that as much.
But that means you’re never going to come back, folks.
And I know you’re going to come back.
We’re going to come back so strong.
We’re going to be so strong.
Stronger than ever before.
Irredeemable.
They don’t talk about that one, but that was, to me, pretty bad.
I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and really, really, really love your country.
Love your country.
Clinton’s entire campaign rests on using a single tactic, and it’s not working very well.
She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads.
And we’re actually I think probably leading — based on everything we’re seeing — and we’ve spent practically nothing.
I’m proud of that.
And you know what?
We’re doing very well.
You know in the old days if you spent less and you had far fewer people and you were leading you got credit.
Today they say well, she’s spending much more money.
Yes, but she’s doing poorly, very poorly.
But what they do is they smear opponents — and you look at her history — and they question policies.
And they talk all the time about racist, racist.
It’s the only word they know.
They used it on Romney.
They used it on everybody.
They use it.
When they’re in trouble, they always pull out the racist word.
And they are in very big trouble, I have to tell you.
And for the most part we haven’t even started spending our money yet.
And we have raised a lot of money.
And I’m putting in my money.
And I put in a hell of a lot of money.
In fact, if things don’t work out, even though a lot of people are saying this was one of the great political phenomenas they’ve ever seen.
They’ve never seen — they call it a phenomena.
I will tell you.
If it doesn’t work out, it will be a tremendous waste of time, energy and money.
And she’s angry for even suggesting it.
But we’re going to — hey look, Nov. 8 you go and vote.
We’re winning.
I’ll tell you what.
If you vote, we’re winning.
There’s no way they can beat us.
There’s no way she can beat us because her people have no enthusiasm, whatsoever.
They’re not going to turn out.
They don’t have the enthusiasm.
Who could possibly have enthusiasm?
What are you getting?
You turn out, we’re winning big league.
And I think — and they’re all saying the Trump people are going to turn out.
We have a movement like they have never, ever seen in this country.
And they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had polling higher.
So I think, I have very little doubt, turnout we’re going to have a tremendous Nov. 8.
Probably we’ll say Nov. 8 plus the next four years and then four years after that, OK?
But the racist word, it’s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook, and Americans have had enough of it, OK. We get it.
We get it.
I’ll tell you what, I just — I told you I just left Little Haiti.
The love is unbelievable.
It’s unbelievable.
There’s no racist.
There’s no nothing.
It’s love.
They want solutions.
They want better lives, not more petty attacks from failed and totally discredited politicians like crooked Hillary Clinton.
They want their immigration laws enforced and their border secured.
[U.S.A. chant]

Let’s win on Nov. 8, OK?
That’ll be —

They’re patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and their families protected.
They want protection.
People who warn about radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes.
Everyone’s an Islamophobe.
You mention something you’re an Islamophobe.
You know they come up with words.
Hey, I went to Ivy League school.
I did very well — great.
They have so many new words.
Islamophobe.
We have a president — and frankly Hillary — who don’t use the words radical Islamic terrorism.
And if you don’t know what you’re fighting, you’re not going to fight it very well.
And we’ve proven that.
We have decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.
We want to keep our country safe.
People who support the police, who want crime reduced and ended, and who are not prejudiced.
They’re concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed, violently, on the streets, which is happening all over our country.
Yet while Hillary Clinton lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge funds — you know look what she’s doing with these hedge funds, raising millions and millions.
I know so many of these people.
Give me a break.
The hedge fund and the Wall Street donors she slanders and smears with her statements last week.
Working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians and certainly enjoyed by her.
Now you know she’s very much against the Second Amendment.
She wants to destroy your Second Amendment.
Guns, guns, guns, right.
I think what we should do is she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before.
I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons.
They should disarm, right?
Right?
I think they should disarm immediately.
What do you think?
Yes?
Yeah.
Take their guns away.
She doesn’t want guns.
Take their — let’s see what happens to her.
Take their guns away.
OK?
It’d be very dangerous.
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her iPhones — with a hammer!
With a hammer!
Thirteen of them.
Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation.
It’s the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disaster she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world.
Everything she touched, it just didn’t work out.
Certainly it didn’t work out for our country.
It’s the same reason why she won’t take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world.
Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home.
We see it.
Look, we see it.
I drove here.
We see it.
We see it.
I’m running to reverse these failures.
And they are incredible failures.
And create a new American future.
And that future begins with prosperity at home.
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words.
And you’re going to like these three words.
Jobs, jobs, jobs.
One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities.
African-American communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.
Democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century, for 60 years, 75 years, even in some cases 100 years straight.
Unabated.
Unbroken.
Over 100 years.
They control the mayor’s offices, the school boards, the city councils and the seats in Congress.
And all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime and more failing schools.
Sixty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six now live in poverty.
More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago this year.
This year.
Think of it, since Jan. 1.
Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.
Can’t get a job.
These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.
And everyone knows that if she’s elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and suffering and crime and heartache.
[U.S.A. chant]

Amazing people.
Amazing country.
We have an amazing country.
And honestly you see the crime statistics.
You’re African-American.
You have the inner city problems that have been going on for ever.
Forever.
You have problems like nobody has.
And you look at crime.
You look at schools.
You look at no jobs.
Look at the worst education.
Look how dangerous.
You can’t walk down the street.
You get shot or your child gets shot.
And I’ve been saying it, and I’ll say it openly — and some people like it and some people don’t like it, and I don’t really care.
What do you have to lose?
I will fix it.
I’m going to fix it.
We’re going to fix our inner cities.
We’re going to make them safe.
We’re going to bring jobs back.
So to the African-American people within the community, what do you have to lose?
It can’t get — honestly, it can’t get — that’s so nice, thank you.
It can’t get any worse.
It can’t get any worse.
It can’t get any worse.
Thank you.
So nice.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It can’t get any worse, the crime, the jobs.
No jobs.
No education.
Worst education.
More unsafe — you go to Afghanistan, right.
We hear Afghanistan.
I mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.
Inner cities.
African-American people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers.
You watch.
We’re going to fix it.
Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years.
Her disastrous record speaks for itself.
And I have to tell you.
When she ran for the United States Senate in New York, we have upstate New York which is a total disaster, economic disaster.
She said she’s going to bring back jobs, jobs, jobs.
She — anyway, she gets elected.
We lost our jobs.
It got worse.
She didn’t do anything.
She didn’t do anything.
She went home.
She went to sleep, OK. She didn’t do anything.
She didn’t do anything.
It got worse.
Far worse now, it’s a total catastrophe.
Just remember that.
When she tells you about jobs, when she tells you she’s going to fix trade deals, she wouldn’t know where to begin.
She wouldn’t know where to begin.
And besides that, to do that kind of thing, to negotiate great trade deals, to re-enhance our — I mean look.
Our military is so depleted.
We have the greatest people on earth.
They’re using equipment that’s old.
They’re flying planes that are old.
You see what’s happening.
It’s a depleted military.
We have to have a strong military.
We have to take care of our vets.
We have to take care of our vets.
But to do these things you need a lot of energy.
And she does not have the energy.
And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States.
The only people that she will deliver for, frankly, are her donors and her special interests.
I’m going to deliver for you, believe me.
The American people.
We’re going to deliver.
You’re gonna be happy.
And those inner cities are going to see progress like they have probably, not probably.
Like they have never seen.
You watch.
Like they have never seen.
Thank you.
If we lower our taxes and we’re getting a massive tax reduction — and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially.
If we remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy.
We have so much energy.
It’s being destroyed, our economic worth.
And negotiate trade deals that put America first.
Then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.
There is no limit.
Pay off our debt.
Pay down our debt.
Reduce taxes.
Get rid of regulations.
My first day in office I’m going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last 10 years.
All needless, job-killing regulations will be immediately canceled.
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.
And we’re going to lift the restrictions on American energy — which means at least another half a million jobs each year.
They are being destroyed.
And we’re unable to compete with other nations.
Very simple.
And that’s just the beginning.
Also on my first day I’m going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
It has turned out to be a disaster.
This alone will instantly save another two million jobs.
And if you look at your premiums, it’s through the roof.
And by the way, on Nov. 1, just before the election on Nov. 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases.
They want to delay it until after the election because it’s election — it’s a disaster.
It’s a disaster.
And your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really long, slow, vicious death, you’re never going to be able to use it, OK. Do you see the deductibles?
You’re never going to be able to use it.
I’m also going to completely reform our trade deals.
We’re going to renegotiate NAFTA.
Probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to, signed in the history of the world, not in the United States.
It’s destroyed our manufacturing in our country.
It’s destroyed.
And by the way, guess who signed it?
Bill Clinton.
You look at all of the places, Florida included.
But you look at upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania.
You look at all of these different places have been destroyed.
Absolutely destroyed.
You look at New England.
Look what happened to New England.
They’ve been destroyed by companies moving out, going into Mexico, firing everybody.
Unemployment through the roof.
We’re going to stand up to China, and keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — another catastrophe.
TPP will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
Nothing can be as bad as NAFTA.
Trans-Pacific Partnership will be almost as bad as NAFTA.
It’ll take your jobs, Ohio.
Remember, it’s going to take your jobs, Ohio.
I tell you that.
Michigan.
So many places.
TPP is a disaster.
We don’t need another massive multinational deal, by the way, that nobody on our side even reads, that ties us up and binds us down and doesn’t even discuss monetary manipulation and devaluation, which is how China and all these countries are beating us so badly.
Not even discussed.
And they had provisions in the agreement, and they would take it out because certain politicians didn’t want to have them in there.
I wonder why.
Another major reform is going to be school choice.
And we’re going to terminate Common Core.
And we’re bringing our education local.
I’ve outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.
This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty, something we are going to do.
Since President Obama came into office another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty.
It’s catastrophic.
And it’s totally unacceptable.
To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs.
We’re going to build up your schools.
And we’re going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.
You have no safety.
You have little opportunity.
This week I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality child care for their children.
Child care.
Ivanka Trump, very much for child care.
She’s been talking about that to me for two years, long before I even decided to go through this journey.
And it’s not easy, I want to tell you.
We speak in rooms like this.
This is about 100 degrees right now.
That’s considered a cool auditorium.
And the reason is we have such big crowds like this one.
Look at that.
Every single corner.
Unbelievable.
These rooms weren’t designed for this many people.
And it is hot in these rooms.
And we stand up here and we talk.
And we do two or three and sometimes we’ll be hitting four a day.
Do you think Hillary Clinton can get through one?
You ever see her 18-minute speech?
Bomb.
Bomb.
Bomb.
See ya.
See ya, I’m going home.
No.
We’re doing it the right way.
And frankly, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising I don’t have to because I do it the old fashioned way.
I come into your neighborhood, right.
It’s a lot cheaper.
It’s a lot harder work, but it’s a lot cheaper.
Very true.
Very, very true.
On policy after policy we’re going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.
We’re also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against Communist oppression.
No, we’re on the right side.
Great people.
They’re great people.
The president’s one-sided deal for Cuba and with Cuba benefits only the Castro regime.
People are very unhappy about it.
You know what’s interesting?
When he landed the plane recently in China, right, they refused to give him a stairway out of Air Force One.
Now that is a first in the history of Air Force One.
So he used basically the mechanics’ stairs.
That’s the stairs they drop down to get the mechanics up to fix the light bulb, right.
When he landed the plane in Saudi Arabia, which we protect.
Without us they wouldn’t be there for two months.
He landed in Saudi Arabia.
He wasn’t greeted by the top officials.
Now what would I have done in those two cases?
Bomb.
Take me back to Washington, Jim.
Let’s go.
Right.
Let’s go.
Let’s go, Jim.
Get going.
Close those doors.
We’re going home.
Now with Cuba, with Cuba we land in Cuba and there’s no Castro to greet him.
The big leaders weren’t there to greet him.
And I have a lot of Cuban friends.
But you would have all done the same thing again.
Jim, let’s close those doors.
We’re going home.
Right?
Right?
Let’s go, captain.
We’re going home.
We’re going into Washington.
Maybe we’ll head into Miami actually.
That’s not a bad idea.
Terrible.
That’s three.
Three.
Saudi Arabia, Cuba, China.
Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history.
Air Force One used to land and people would respect the people inside.
And they’d come out and there’d be all sorts of hoopla.
Not anymore.
It’s unbelievable.
And these are countries that have benefited by us greatly.
So we have to make great deals before we do anything with Cuba or anybody else, right.
We’re going to make great deals.
You’ll be happy.
You’re going to be happy, I tell you.
How many people are from Cuba here?
Come here.
Tell me.
Cuban.
Cuban.
Good.
Do you agree with me?
Do you agree?
We’ll do it.
But we’ll do it with great deals.
And we’ll do it with democracy.
And we’ll do it the way we have to do it.
OK?
We’ll do it the right way.
Where is Ms. Delgado?
Does everybody know?
What a great — where is she?
She is so amazing.
A.J.
Where is A.J.
Wow, she’s so — she’s become a tremendous star.
Tell you one thing, when she’s representing me I wouldn’t do it anyway, but I can.
Turn off the television.
I’m well protected.
Thank you.
Great job.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, A.J.
But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them.
And that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands.
Not my demands, our demands.
You know what the demands are.
Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.
And the freeing of political prisoners.
The freeing of political prisoners.
Right?
Am I — is that right?
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
What energy in this room.
What energy.
A lot of energy.
You’ll be very happy, my Cuban friends.
I have so many friends from Cuba.
Incredible people.
So let’s also talk about a place called Venezuela.
They — now who’s here from Venezuela?
Or related in some — not too many.
Whoa.
Whoa.
What’s going on?
Not too many?
Friend or foe?
I think he’s friend.
I think he’s friend.
No, he’s OK. He’s OK.

By the way, is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?
You tell me.
Right?
Tell you.
We have a lot of Venezuelans around Doral, the Doral section, right.
And it’s a beautiful, vibrant — this is an amazing place.
But they are really having trouble over in Venezuela.
But Miami is filled with hardworking, incredible Venezuelan people.
But it’s been hurt very badly by Socialist Venezuela.
And the next president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our atmosphere.
And we will stand with oppressed people.
And there are many.
The oppressed people of Venezuela, they are yearning to be free.
They are yearning for help.
The system is bad.
But the people are great.
Great.
They are great people.
Here in America I’ll push to expand freedom for all of our citizens.
I’m going to lower your taxes so substantially.
We’re getting rid of all of those regulations on business.
So many small business owners here, I know five of them.
One of them was small business now he’s big business.
I’m proud of him.
He’s right here.
But we’re going to get rid of those terrible, terrible regulations.
He just said to me, and the thing that surprised me most, we’re bringing business tax rates down from 35 percent to 15 percent.
And yet — it’ll be the greatest cut, I believe, in the history of our country.
But I will tell you what surprises me tremendously is that the people that have these cuts, they’re more concerned with regulation than even a big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and stopping our businesses from hiring people, jobs.
So I’m going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution.
I’m going to rebuild our depleted — we’re going to take care of our, the vets.
Who’s a vet?
Who’s a vet?
Where are my vets?
Where are they?
There they — OK. Now they’re standing up.
Now they — I know we had a lot of vets here.
Thank you, fellas.
Thank you very much.
We’re going to take care of our vets.
We’re going to save your Second Amendment.
Do you know if you look at some of the things, the catastrophes — you look at Orlando.
You look at San Bernardino.
You look at so many different — you look at Paris.
The toughest gun laws in the world, they have it in Paris.
These thugs, these animals walked in and they just go bomb, bomb, bomb.
Nobody had guns on the other side.
If there were guns on the other side, just a few of them, number one, probably if they knew, they wouldn’t have attacked.
And number two, even if they did attack, it would’ve been a whole different story.
One hundred thirty people killed.
People massively injured, still in the hospital.
Their lives are just destroyed.
And if they had protection, if they had guns on the other side, with the bullets flying the other direction, it would’ve been a whole different story.
So we’re going to protect your Second Amendment.
And I’m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming into our country.
And yes, we will build a wall.
We’ll build a wall.
We will build a wall.
[Build that wall chant]

Who’s going to pay for the wall?
One hundred percent.
One hundred percent.
And we’re going to be renegotiating NAFTA and our terrible trade deals.
We’re going to make great deals out of horrible deals.
And if we can’t renegotiate the deal because the other side is so, so happy with it, we’re going to terminate the deal and we’ll start all over again, folks.
We’ll have new deals.
And they’ll be much better deals.
And they’ll be two-way streets.
The traffic, it’ll be coming our way.
It’s a one-way street out of the United States for our jobs and our money.
You know I always say we get the drugs, they get the cash.
That’s the deal, folks.
No good.
They’re building in Mexico right now, and Mexico’s just one example, some of the greatest plants.
A friend of mine builds plants.
And he tells me all the time — I called him up the other day.
I called him up six months ago, told me the same thing.
Nothing changes.
Ford.
They just announced yesterday they’re moving their small car division, the whole thing, into Mexico.
That’s on top of spending billions and billions of dollars.
And then you wonder why I’m winning in Michigan.
Because I’ve been telling the people in Michigan.
I’ve been telling the people in Ohio for five years that this is happening.
And our politicians don’t do anything about it.
And Hillary Clinton will never do anything about it.
She doesn’t have the capability to do it.
We will rebuild our roads and bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.
American cars will travel the roads.
American planes will soar in the sky.
They’ll soar.
And American ships will patrol the seas.
American steel will send new skyscrapers right here in Miami into the clouds.
But it’ll be American steel.
American hands will rebuild this nation.
And American energy mined from American sources will power our energy.
And we’ll take care of our steel workers.
And we’ll take care of our miners who have been destroyed by this administration, destroyed.
And Hillary Clinton has already said she’s going to put the miners out of business.
We’re going to take care of our miners.
They’re amazing people.
American workers will be hired to do the job.
We will put new American steel into the spine of our country.
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation.
And I will fight to bring us all together as one people.
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag.
[U.S.A. chant]

It’s time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.
We’re not prosperous anymore.
We owe $20 trillion.
We have a president who in seven-and-a-half years has doubled the debt.
Our country’s in trouble.
A lot of people don’t know it, but our country’s in trouble.
And we’re going to make sure that trouble never comes.
Let me tell you.
Jobs will return.
Incomes will rise.
And new factories will come rushing back to our shores.
Once more we will have a government of, by and for the people.
We will make America wealthy again.
We will make America safe again.
We will make America strong again.
And we will make America great again.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miami.
SPEECH 8: Trump Letter to Pelosi on Impeachment - Dec. 17, 2019

I write to express my strongest and most powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade being pursued by the Democrats in the House of Representatives.
This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history.
The Articles of Impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognizable under any standard of Constitutional theory, interpretation, or jurisprudence.
They include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever.
You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!
By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy.
You dare to invoke the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this election-nullification scheme—yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America’s founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build.
Even worse than offending the Founding Fathers, you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying “I pray for the President,” when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense.
It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!
Your first claim, “Abuse of Power,” is a completely disingenuous, meritless, and baseless invention of your imagination.
You know that I had a totally innocent conversation with the President of Ukraine.
I then had a second conversation that has been misquoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently misrepresented.
Fortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect.
I said to President Zelensky:  “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.”  I said do us a favor, not me, and our country, not a campaign.
I then mentioned the Attorney General of the United States.
Every time I talk with a foreign leader, I put America’s interests first, just as I did with President Zelensky.
You are turning a policy disagreement between two branches of government into an impeachable offense—it is no more legitimate than the Executive Branch charging members of Congress with crimes for the lawful exercise of legislative power.
You know full well that Vice President Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was digging into the company paying his son millions of dollars.
You know this because Biden bragged about it on video.
Biden openly stated:  “I said, ‘I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars’…I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours.
If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’  Well, son of a bitch.
He got fired.”  Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it “looked bad.”  Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually did.
President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure.
He further emphasized that it was a “good phone call,” that “I don’t feel pressure,” and explicitly stressed that “nobody pushed me.”  The Ukrainian Foreign Minister stated very clearly:  “I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance.”  He also said there was “No Pressure.”   Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a supporter of Ukraine who met privately with President Zelensky, has said: “At no time during this meeting…was there any mention by Zelensky or any Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to do anything in return for the military aid.”  Many meetings have been held between representatives of Ukraine and our country.
Never once did Ukraine complain about pressure being applied—not once!
Ambassador Sondland testified that I told him: “No quid pro quo.
I want nothing.
I want nothing.
I want President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.”

The second claim, so-called “Obstruction of Congress,” is preposterous and dangerous.
House Democrats are trying to impeach the duly elected President of the United States for asserting Constitutionally based privileges that have been asserted on a bipartisan basis by administrations of both political parties throughout our Nation’s history.
Under that standard, every American president would have been impeached many times over.
As liberal law professor Jonathan Turley warned when addressing Congressional Democrats: “I can’t emphasize this enough…if you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power.
It’s your abuse of power.
You’re doing precisely what you’re criticizing the President for doing.”

Everyone, you included, knows what is really happening.
Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat.
You have developed a full-fledged case of what many in the media call Trump Derangement Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over it!
You are unwilling and unable to accept the verdict issued at the ballot box during the great Election of 2016.
So you have spent three straight years attempting to overturn the will of the American people and nullify their votes.
You view democracy as your enemy!
Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last week at a public forum that your party’s impeachment effort has been going on for “two and a half years,” long before you ever heard about a phone call with Ukraine.
Nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office, the Washington Post published a story headlined, “The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.”  Less than three months after my inauguration, Representative Maxine Waters stated, “I’m going to fight every day until he’s impeached.”  House Democrats introduced the first impeachment resolution against me within months of my inauguration, for what will be regarded as one of our country’s best decisions, the firing of James Comey (see Inspector General Reports)—who the world now knows is one of the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen.
A ranting and raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, declared just hours after she was sworn into office, “We’re gonna go in there and we’re gonna impeach the motherf****r.”  Representative Al Green said in May, “I’m concerned that if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”  Again, you and your allies said, and did, all of these things long before you ever heard of President Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine.
As you know very well, this impeachment drive has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the totally appropriate conversation I had with its new president.
It only has to do with your attempt to undo the election of 2016 and steal the election of 2020!
Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied all the way up to the present day, even going so far as to fraudulently make up, out of thin air, my conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy language to Congress as though it were said by me.
His shameless lies and deceptions, dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax, is one of the main reasons we are here today.
You and your party are desperate to distract from America’s extraordinary economy, incredible jobs boom, record stock market, soaring confidence, and flourishing citizens.
Your party simply cannot compete with our record: 7 million new jobs; the lowest-ever unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans; a rebuilt military; a completely reformed VA with Choice and Accountability for our great veterans; more than 170 new federal judges and two Supreme Court Justices; historic tax and regulation cuts; the elimination of the individual mandate; the first decline in prescription drug prices in half a century; the first new branch of the United States Military since 1947, the Space Force; strong protection of the Second Amendment; criminal justice reform; a defeated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the world’s number one terrorist leader, al-Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a breakthrough Phase One trade deal with China; massive new trade deals with Japan and South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming the world’s top energy producer; recognition of Israel’s capital, opening the American Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a colossal reduction in illegal border crossings, the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the building of the Southern Border Wall—and that is just the beginning, there is so much more.
You cannot defend your extreme policies—open borders, mass migration, high crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare, destruction of American energy, late-term taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the Second Amendment, radical far-left theories of law and justice, and constant partisan obstruction of both common sense and common good.
There is nothing I would rather do than stop referring to your party as the Do-Nothing Democrats.
Unfortunately, I don’t know that you will ever give me a chance to do so.
After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership now proven to be totally incompetent and corrupt, you have found NOTHING!
Few people in high position could have endured or passed this test.
You do not know, nor do you care, the great damage and hurt you have inflicted upon wonderful and loving members of my family.
You conducted a fake investigation upon the democratically elected President of the United States, and you are doing it yet again.
There are not many people who could have taken the punishment inflicted during this period of time, and yet done so much for the success of America and its citizens.
But instead of putting our country first, you have decided to disgrace our country still further.
You completely failed with the Mueller report because there was nothing to find, so you decided to take the next hoax that came along, the phone call with Ukraine—even though it was a perfect call.
And by the way, when I speak to foreign countries, there are many people, with permission, listening to the call on both sides of the conversation.
You are the ones interfering in America’s elections.
You are the ones subverting America’s Democracy.
You are the ones Obstructing Justice.
You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain.
Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the Russian Witch Hunt.
Against all evidence, and regardless of the truth, you and your deputies claimed that my campaign colluded with the Russians—a grave, malicious, and slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other.
You forced our Nation through turmoil and torment over a wholly fabricated story, illegally purchased from a foreign spy by Hillary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault our democracy.
Yet, when the monstrous lie was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy dissolved into dust, you did not apologize.
You did not recant.
You did not ask to be forgiven.
You showed no remorse, no capacity for self-reflection.
Instead, you pursued your next libelous and vicious crusade—you engineered an attempt to frame and defame an innocent person.
All of this was motivated by personal political calculation.
Your Speakership and your party are held hostage by your most deranged and radical representatives of the far left.
Each one of your members lives in fear of a socialist primary challenger—this is what is driving impeachment.
Look at Congressman Nadler’s challenger.
Look at yourself and others.
Do not take our country down with your party.
If you truly cared about freedom and liberty for our Nation, then you would be devoting your vast investigative resources to exposing the full truth concerning the FBI’s horrifying abuses of power before, during, and after the 2016 election—including the use of spies against my campaign, the submission of false evidence to a FISA court, and the concealment of exculpatory evidence in order to frame the innocent.
The FBI has great and honorable people, but the leadership was inept and corrupt.
I would think that you would personally be appalled by these revelations, because in your press conference the day you announced impeachment, you tied the impeachment effort directly to the completely discredited Russia Hoax, declaring twice that “all roads lead to Putin,” when you know that is an abject lie.
I have been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever even thought to be.
Any member of Congress who votes in support of impeachment—against every shred of truth, fact, evidence, and legal principle—is showing how deeply they revile the voters and how truly they detest America’s Constitutional order.
Our Founders feared the tribalization of partisan politics, and you are bringing their worst fears to life.
Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present.
I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses, like the so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made.
Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us.
In other words, once the phone call was made public, your whole plot blew up, but that didn’t stop you from continuing.
More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.
You and others on your committees have long said impeachment must be bipartisan—it is not.
You said it was very divisive—it certainly is, even far more than you ever thought possible—and it will only get worse!
This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth.
You are not just after me, as President, you are after the entire Republican Party.
But because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before.
History will judge you harshly as you proceed with this impeachment charade.
Your legacy will be that of turning the House of Representatives from a revered legislative body into a Star Chamber of partisan persecution.
Perhaps most insulting of all is your false display of solemnity.
You apparently have so little respect for the American People that you expect them to believe that you are approaching this impeachment somberly, reservedly, and reluctantly.
No intelligent person believes what you are saying.
Since the moment I won the election, the Democrat Party has been possessed by Impeachment Fever.
There is no reticence.
This is not a somber affair.
You are making a mockery of impeachment and you are scarcely concealing your hatred of me, of the Republican Party, and tens of millions of patriotic Americans.
The voters are wise, and they are seeing straight through this empty, hollow, and dangerous game you are playing.
I have no doubt the American people will hold you and the Democrats fully responsible in the upcoming 2020 election.
They will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power.
There is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens.
It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American People.
While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record.
One hundred years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again.
SPEECH 9: President Trump’s National Emergency Remarks - Feb. 15, 2019

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.
Before we begin, I’d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.
We’ve had a negotiation going on for about two days.
It’s going extremely well.
Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.
But we’re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot.
Very good relationship that we have.
And we’re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal.
We’re covering everything — all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn’t be done, whether it was theft or anything.
Anything.
The unfairness.
We’ve been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China.
A lot of people think it’s $506 billion.
Some people think it’s much more than that.
We’re going to be leveling the playing field.
The tariffs are hurting China very badly.
They don’t want them.
And frankly, if we can make the deal, it’d be my honor to remove them.
But otherwise, we’re having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury.
We’ve never had that before with China.
It’s been very much of a one-way street.
So, that’s happening.
And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country.
They haven’t respected us for a long time.
Not for a long time.
The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we’re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement.
You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems.
But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that’s just been strengthened further.
So with the UK, we’re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.
We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States.
The relationship there, also, is very good.
We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.
And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.
And many other things.
A lot of positive things are going on.
We’re working on a summit.
And you know all about the summit.
It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.
And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.
We’ll be meeting in Hanoi.
I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.
And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.
A lot was done in the first summit.
No more rockets going up.
No more missiles going up.
No more testing of nuclear.
Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.
And we got back our hostages.
But we hope we’re going to be very much equally as successful.
I’m in no rush for speed.
We just don’t want testing.
The sanctions, as you know, remain.
Everything is remaining.
China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.
And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan.
But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing.
And that’s okay — as per the United Nations.
So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.
I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.
We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.
They have really taken advantage of the United States.
Billions of dollars has been paid to them.
And we won’t let that happen.
But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.
Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal.
And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.
So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.
Today, I’m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.
We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.
But we don’t control our own border.
So we’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.
And we’re going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.
It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.
We’re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before.
You look at other economies — they’re doing terribly, and we’re doing phenomenally.
The market is up tremendously today, not that that’s anything, but, you know — because I’ll go back in and they’ll say, “Oh, the market just went down.”  But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.
We have all the records.
We have every record.
But we’re getting close to that point again where we’ll create new records.
So our country is doing very well, economically.
And we’ve done a lot.
But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.
When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry.
It’s wrong.
It’s wrong.
It’s just a lie.
It’s all a lie.
They say walls don’t work.
Walls work 100 percent.
Whether it’s El Paso — I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso — we had a tremendous crowd, and — tremendous crowd.
And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.
And I asked them.
I said, “Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?”  You were there, some of you.
It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.
You know what they did.
But that’s only one example.
There are so many examples.
In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.
And they had 23 murders.
It’s a lot of murders, but it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico.
So everyone knows that walls work.
And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.
You just take a look.
Almost everywhere.
Take a look at Israel.
They’re building another wall.
Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent.
That’s what it would be with us, too.
The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.
They go around the wall and in.
Okay?
That’s what it is.
It’s very simple.
And a big majority of the big drugs — the big drug loads — don’t go through ports of entry.
They can’t go through ports of entry.
You can’t take big loads because you have people — we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement — looking.
You can’t take human traffic — women and girls — you can’t take them through ports of entry.
You can’t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.
They open the door.
They look.
They can’t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.
They go through areas where you have no wall.
Everybody knows that.
Nancy knows it.
Chuck knows it.
They all know it.
It’s all a big lie.
It’s a big con game.
You don’t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that’s it.
They can’t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there’s no barrier, and they come into the United States.
Welcome.
We’ve detained more people.
Our border agents are doing such incredible work.
Our military has been incredible.
We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.
We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.
It’s very successful.
But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.
And it’s very necessary.
We’ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.
They just are breaking.
They’re in the process of breaking up.
We have another one that we haven’t been able to break up yet.
We’ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.
I want to thank the President.
I want to thank Mexico.
They have their own problems.
They have the largest number of murders that they’ve ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders.
Forty thousand.
And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will.
But I just want to thank the President, because he’s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.
We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.
It’s largely broken up.
Others have gotten through.
And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.
If we didn’t have the wall up, and if we didn’t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they’d be welcomed to the United States.
One of the things we’d save tremendous — just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.
If we had a wall, we don’t need the military because we’d have a wall.
So I’m going to be signing a national emergency.
And it’s been signed many times before.
It’s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.
It gave the Presidents the power.
There’s rarely been a problem.
They sign it; nobody cares.
I guess they weren’t very exciting.
But nobody cares.
They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.
We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.
We have some of the greatest people I know.
They’ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign — almost from the first week.
The Angel Moms.
Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.
One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who — we’re talking about killed, in the year of ’18.
I said, “I haven’t seen you before.”  She said, “No, I’m new.”  I said, “That’s too bad.”  It’s too bad.
It’s so sad.
Stand up, just for a second.
Show how beautiful your girl was.
Thank you.
I have such respect for these people.
Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.
I have great respect for these people.
These are great people.
These are great people.
They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.
And the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly.
And they’re not treated the way they should be.
They’re fighting for other people because they don’t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.
We have one young lady whose husband — please, stand up.
Your husband was just killed in Maryland.
Incredible man.
Just killed.
Beautiful children — won’t be seeing their father again.
These are brave people.
These are people that — they don’t have to be here.
They don’t have to be doing this.
They’re doing it for other people.
So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?
I really do.
I want to thank you.
Incredible people.
Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.
And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit — before I even started talking about the trade — it was a trade meeting.
It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important.
I said, “Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country.
It kills tens of thousands of people — I think far more than anybody registers.
And I’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.”  And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.
Their criminal list — a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.
Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?”

And when I asked President Xi, I said, “Do you have a drug problem?”  “No, no, no.”  I said, “You have 1.4 billion people.
What do you mean you have no drug problem?”  “No, we don’t have a drug problem.”  I said, “Why?” “Death penalty.
We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.”  End of problem.
What do we do?
We set up blue ribbon committees.
Lovely men and women — they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.
So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.
You can end the drug problem.
You can end it a lot faster than you think.
But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.
And it’s a criminal penalty.
And the penalty is death.
So that’s, frankly, one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.
I think maybe there’s no more important point.
We’re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.
It’s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.
Their market is down close to 40 percent.
Our market is way up.
We’ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.
Trillions.
Many trillions.
And China has lost trillions of dollars.
But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.
So we’ll see what happens.
China is coming here next week, by the way.
They’re coming home, the traders.
And then China is coming here next week.
And then I’ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe — for some remaining deals.
We’ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves.
So, we’re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.
And it’s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable.
And by signing the national emergency — something signed many times by other Presidents — many, many times.
President Obama — in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.
Criminal cartels.
It’s a very good emergency that he signed.
And we’re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.
So that would be a second national emergency.
But, in that case, it’s already in place.
And what we want — really want to do — is simple.
It’s not like it’s complicated.
It’s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.
We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.
Nobody has done the job that we’ve ever done.
I mean, nobody has done the job that we’ve done on the border.
And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy — and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.
You know, I hear a lot of people say, “Oh, well.
But maybe the previous administration…”  Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.
We would have been down the tubes.
The regulations were strangling our country.
Unnecessary regulations.
By creating such a strong economy — you just look at your televisions or see what’s going on today; it’s through the roof.
What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before.
And we’ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it’s a massive number of people.
If we had the wall, it would be very easy.
We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.
We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.
You wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent.
We would get — we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.
You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.
Law enforcement and Border Patrol.
And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.
ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.
And, by the way, we’re going to be taking care of ICE.
You know, we talk about the new bill.
We’re going to be taking care of ICE.
They wanted to get rid of ICE.
And the bill is just the opposite of that.
A lot of good things happened.
So, that’s the story.
We want to have a safe country.
I ran on a very simple slogan: “Make America Great Again.”  If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.
But we’ve done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment.
We haven’t been given the walls.
And in the bill, by the way, they didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff.
Ports of entry.
We have so much money, we don’t know what to do with it.
I don’t know what to do with all the money they’re giving us.
It’s crazy.
The only place they don’t want to give as much money — $1,375,000,000.
Sounds like a lot, but it’s not so much, although we’re putting it to much better use than it used to be.
A lot of the past administrations, they had — it was easy to get, and they didn’t build or they didn’t do what they could have done.
It would have been great.
It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession.
And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.
People that should have stepped up did not step up.
They didn’t step up, and they should have.
Would have been easy.
Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.
But some people didn’t step up.
But we’re stepping up now.
So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.
Whether it’s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall.
We’re getting it done.
We’re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.
And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.
That’s where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.
In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.
But we’re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.
So — and we need new wall.
So I want to thank everybody for being here.
I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.
Thank you very much.
We have great respect for you.
The real country, our real country — the people that really love our country, they love you.
So I just want you to know that.
I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you’re having.
I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.
Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.
And we’re giving you a lot of surplus.
We’re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn’t like giving, previous to this administration.
But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.
And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.
And you have much better protection.
But I really appreciate you being here.
So the order is signed.
And I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.
And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there.
And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling.
And then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake.
And we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.
They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won.
And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.
Because we have a ban.
It’s very helpful.
Madam Secretary, is that right?
Without the ban, we’d have a bigger problem.
We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what’s going on in the world.
And we won.
But somebody said, “President Trump lost on the ban.”  Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.
He — he didn’t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.
They didn’t want to say that.
They didn’t want to go that far.
They were saying how I lost.
The person sitting right up here — “Donald Trump lost on the ban.”  Yeah, I did.
And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.
And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.
Didn’t want to take it that far.
But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too.
The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we’re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.
And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.
Thousands.
They’re out of this country.
We take them out by the thousands.
And they are monsters.
Okay.
Do you have any questions?
Yeah.
John, go ahead.
Q    Mr. President — (inaudible).
AIDE:  Yes, we do.
There you go.
Q    You were prepared.
Mr. President, a lot of the money —

THE PRESIDENT:  Were you saying I was prepared?
Q    With the microphone and prepared for questions.
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.
I couldn’t believe you said that.
Q    (Laughs.)
No, no, no.
(Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  People don’t like saying that.
Q    You were prepared for questions.
THE PRESIDENT:  I am prepared.
I’m always prepared.
Q    A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that’s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.
How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.
Some of them haven’t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.
I was speaking to a couple of them.
They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.
I said, “What were you going to use it for?”  And I won’t go into details, but it didn’t sound too important to me.
Plus, if you think, I’ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.
And we’re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.
And under the previous administration, our military was depleted — badly depleted.
And they weren’t spending — I mean, they had a much less — they had a much smaller amount of money.
So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion — and this year, it’s going to be pretty big too, because there’s few things more important than our military.
You know, I’m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.
It was very badly depleted.
And we’re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.
We have — we’ll soon have a military like we’ve never had before.
But when you think about the kind of numbers you’re talking about — so you have $700 billion, $716 billion — when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall — which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.
And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.
And that’s part of it, too.
We’re taking a lot of money from that realm also.
But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we’re asking for.
Yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead.
ABC.
Not NBC.
I like ABC a little bit more — not much.
Come on, ABC.
Not much.
Pretty close.
Q    Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?
Marco Rubio has made this point.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, not too many people.
Yeah.
Not too many people have said that.
But the courts will determine that.
Look, I expect to be sued.
I shouldn’t be sued.
Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.
And then other people say, “Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?”  We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.
It’s an invasion.
We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it’s very hard to stop.
With a wall, it would be very easy.
So I think that we will be very successful in court.
I think it’s clear.
And the people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have?
Fifty-six?
There are a lot of times — well, that’s creating precedent.
And many of those are far less important than having a border.
If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country.
You know, we fight — before I got here — we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don’t create a border for our own country.
So I think what will happen is, sadly, we’ll be sued, and sadly, it’ll go through a process.
And, happily, we’ll win — I think.
Go ahead.
Let’s go.
Let’s hear it, NBC.
Come on.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, “The whole concept of executive order, it’s not the way the country is supposed to be run.”  You said, “You’re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal.”  Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you’re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?
THE PRESIDENT:  No.
Look, I went through Congress.
I made a deal.
I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get one dollar — not one dollar.
“He’s not going to get one dollar.”  Well, I got $1.4 billion.
But I’m not happy with it.
I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things — port of entries, lots of different things.
The purchase of drug equipment.
More than we were even requesting.
In fact, the primary fight was on the wall.
Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don’t know what to do with it we have so much money.
But on the wall, they skimped.
So I did — I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.
I could do the wall over a longer period of time.
I didn’t need to do this.
But I’d rather do it much faster.
And I don’t have to do it for the election.
I’ve already done a lot of wall, for the election — 2020.
And the only reason we’re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they’re not going to be able to do.
And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense.
And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.
Okay.
Yes, ma’am, go ahead.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Q    Roberta Rampton from Reuters.
I wanted to ask about China.
Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, you’re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?
I mean, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.
And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel — much of it comes from China — at 25 percent.
Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they’re building plants all over the United States.
It’s a beautiful thing.
And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel.
You know, you can do without certain industries.
Our country cannot do without steel.
So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.
And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.
And I haven’t even started.
Now, here’s the thing: If we make a deal, they won’t have to pay.
You know, it’ll be a whole different story.
They won’t be paying that, but we’ll have a fair deal.
There won’t be intellectual property theft.
There won’t be so many other things that have gone on.
And no other President has done this.
No other — you know, we didn’t have a deal with China.
You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made — probably even worse than NAFTA, if that’s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.
It was a total disaster for our country.
And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific — a great deal.
And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico — that’s United States, Mexico, Canada — that’s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.
And nobody wants to talk about that.
Because we’re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal.
Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they’ll say — one of the things I’m thinking of doing — this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they’ve built over the last two years — which is a lot — and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, “What a lousy deal; that’s a terrible deal.”

Like, ZTE, I got a billion — more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.
And the Democrats said, “Oh, should’ve gotten more.”  When I made that deal, I said, “This is incredible.”  I just got — I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.
They had to change their top management.
But they had to pay over a billion dollars.
I said, “What a deal.”  It took like a week.
And the Democrats didn’t even know there was a problem with ZTE.
I’m the one that find them.
I’m the one that settled it.
Over a billion dollars.
And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.
And we made a deal — paid — like, in a short period of time.
The Democrats went out and said, “Oh, they should’ve done better.”  So what I’m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives.
And we’ll all go down together, and what we’ll do is we’ll negotiate.
I’ll put them in the room and let them speak up.
Because any deal I make with China, if it’s the great — it’s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I’m not going to have a deal.
It’s a very simple.
But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, “Oh, it should’ve been better.
It should’ve been better.”  And you know what?
That’s not acceptable to me.
So I’m thinking about doing something very different.
I don’t think it’s ever been — I just don’t want to be second-guessed.
But that’s not even second-guess; that’s called politics.
Sadly, I’d probably do the same thing to them, okay?
But any deal I make toward the end, I’m going to bring Schumer — at least offer him — and Pelosi.
I’m going to say, “Please join me on the deal.”

And, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row.
Please stand up, Bill.
(Applause.)
Such an easy job he’s got.
He’s got the easiest job in government.
Thank you and congratulations.
That was a great vote yesterday.
Thank you very much.
Q    Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Q    In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you would’ve preferred that this be done.
Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?
And —

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m learning.
I mean, I am learning.
Don’t forget, it’s not like I’ve done this for — a senator came into my office and said, “Sir, I’ve been running for office for 30 years.
I’ve won seven out of seven.
I did lose a couple when I was younger.”  I said, “Well, I’ve won one out of one.
But, you know, I never did politics before.
Now I do politics.”  I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster.
Q    Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir?
THE PRESIDENT:  But I’ve learned — who?
Q    Speaker Ryan.
THE PRESIDENT:  Let’s not talk about it.
Q    Okay.
THE PRESIDENT:  What difference does it make?
But they should have pushed it faster.
They should have pushed it harder.
And they didn’t.
They didn’t.
If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.
In the meantime, I’ve built a lot of wall.
I have a lot of money, and I’ve built a lot of wall.
But it would’ve been nice to have gotten done.
And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that’s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform — not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things.
We have a real problem.
We have catch-and-release.
You catch a criminal and you have to release them.
We have so many other things.
You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members — because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle — they’re all in.
You know what happened on the West Side Highway.
That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured — nobody talks about that — horribly — like, loss of legs and arms — going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.
He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.
It’s called chain migration.
And then you have the lottery.
It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery.
It’s common sense.
If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want.
The lottery system is a disaster.
I’m stuck with it.
Q    Mr. President, could you tell us —

THE PRESIDENT:  It should have — wait.
It should have never happened.
Okay.
Q    Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency?
THE PRESIDENT:  I would talk about it.
Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do.
Not of me.
If I changed my views, he wouldn’t be with me.
Rush Limbaugh — I think he’s a great guy.
Here’s a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.
Try doing that sometime.
For three hours, he speaks.
He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.
I mean, this guy is unbelievable.
Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.
Taking calls is easy.
“Okay, I’ll answer this one.
I’ll answer that one.”  He goes for three hours, and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.
Q    Should they be —

THE PRESIDENT:  Wait —

Q    Should they be deciding policy, sir?
THE PRESIDENT:   They don’t decide policy.
In fact, if I went opposite — I mean, they have somebody — Ann Coulter.
I don’t know her.
I hardly know her.
I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.
But the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.”  Probably, if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice.
I just don’t have the time to speak to her.
I would speak to her; I have nothing against her.
In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, “Donald Trump.”  And the two people that asked her that question smiled.
They said, “You’re kidding, aren’t you?”  “Nope.
Donald Trump.”

So I like her, but she’s off the reservation.
But anybody that knows her understands that.
But I haven’t spoken to her.
I don’t follow her.
I don’t talk to her.
But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.”  And you know what?
I think she’s fine.
I think she’s good.
But I just don’t speak to her.
Laura has been great.
Laura Ingraham.
Tucker Carlson has been great.
I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.
I have some on MSNBC.
The other day, they did a great report of me.
I said, “Where the hell did that come from?”  I think it was the only one in over a year.
So the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen — 52 percent in the polls.
It’s my highest poll number.
And people get what we’re doing.
They get it.
They really get it.
And I’m honored by it.
Yes.
Jim Acosta.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what’s happening at the border — calling it an “invasion,” talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on — and yet there’s a lot of reporting out there, there’s a lot of crime data out there, there’s a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low —

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s because of us.
But it’s still —

Q    — that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.
It’s still massive numbers of crossings.
Q    — that shows undocumented criminals — or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.
What do you say —

THE PRESIDENT:  You don’t really believe that stat, do you?
Do you really believe that stat?
Q    What do you — well, let me ask you this —

THE PRESIDENT:  Take a look at our federal prisons.
Q    I believe in facts and statistics and data, but —

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay?
Any more?
Quick, let’s go.
Q    Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you’re concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn’t get it through other ways?
THE PRESIDENT:  I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?
Do you think I’m creating something?
Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.
Okay?
PARTICIPANT:  This is real.
THE PRESIDENT:  Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.
You’re CNN.
You’re fake news.
You have an agenda.
The numbers that you gave are wrong.
Take a look at our federal prison population.
See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens.
Just see.
Go ahead and see.
It’s a fake question.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Q    Can I ask a follow-up?
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics — numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government — show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most —

THE PRESIDENT:  There’s not violence on the border?
Q    There’s not as much violence as —

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, really?
Q    Let me — wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait —

THE PRESIDENT:  You had 26 people killed —

Q    Let me finish the question, please.
Let me finish the question, please.
THE PRESIDENT:  Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border —

Q    I understand what you’re — I understand what you’re saying.
THE PRESIDENT:  — a mile away from where I went.
Q    I was there.
I understand.
That’s not the question.
The question is —

THE PRESIDENT:  Do we forget about that?
Q    No, I’m not forgetting about it.
I’m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.
Q    So what do you base your facts on?
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, let me — come on, let’s go.
Sort of — sort of —

Q    And, secondly —

THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.
You get one.
You get one.
Ready?
Q    Well, the second question is —

THE PRESIDENT:  Just sit down.
Wait.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Q    Could you please answer it?
THE PRESIDENT:  Sit down.
You get one question.
I get my numbers from a lot of sources — like Homeland Security, primarily.
And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.
And you know what else is a disaster?
The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.
Billions and billions of dollars.
And it’s unnecessary.
Q    So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.
I use many stats.
I use many stats.
Q    Could you share those stats with us?
THE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.
But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security.
All right, next question.
Q    And do you — wait a minute.
Just a quick follow-up.
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
No.
Go.
Please.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
I just want to bring you back to China for a second.
The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.
The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide.
Are you eyeing a possible extension — 30 days, maybe 60 days?
What is the status there?
Or is March 1st the deadline?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
Very good question.
So it’s a very big deal.
I guess you could say it’s like — must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think.
Trade with China, how big does that get?
Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.
But it’s very complicated.
There are many, many points that we’re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they’re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them.
There is a possibility that I will extend the date.
And if I do that, if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now.
I would not increase the tariffs.
Q    Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it’s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office.
Now it’s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.
What are your plans to reverse it?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s all about growth.
But before I —

Q    (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  — really focus on that — and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined.
So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.
Combine them all.
So you can’t be talking about that.
But I talk about it because I consider it very important.
But first, I have to straighten out the military.
The military was depleted.
And if we don’t have a strong military — that hopefully we won’t have to use because it’s strong — if we don’t have a strong military, you don’t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems.
So I have to straighten out the military.
That’s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.
But growth will straighten it out.
You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.
Everybody said, “What happened?”  Well, what’s happening is growth.
But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military.
And we have no choice but to straighten out our military.
Q    Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, ma’am, go ahead.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
On North Korea — back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
Q    I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit.
And then —

THE PRESIDENT:  A lot.
Q    — are we going to be seeing anything concrete —

THE PRESIDENT:  A lot has been accomplished.
Okay.
Q    — on denuclearization.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
A lot has been accomplished.
We’re dealing with them, we’re talking to them.
When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama.
And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.
It was supposed to be 15 minutes.
As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that.
And I said, “What’s the biggest problem?”  He said, “By far, North Korea.”  And I don’t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea.
I think he was ready to go to war.
In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.
And where are we now?
No missiles.
No rockets.
No nuclear testing.
We’ve learned a lot.
But much more importantly than all of it — much more important — much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship.
I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.
And I’ve done a job.
In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize.
He said, “I have nominated you…” or “Respectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize.”  I said, “Thank you.”  Many other people feel that way too.
I’ll probably never get it, but that’s okay.
They gave it to Obama.
He didn’t even know what he got it for.
He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.
He said, “Oh, what did I get it for?”  With me, I probably will never get it.
But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people.
Nobody talk about that.
They don’t talk about that.
Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists.
And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, “Please, please.”  And I thought — I said, “No, it can’t happen.
What are you talking about?”  “No, they’re going to get…”  And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into — to really — to really do big destruction.
And I put out a statement that “you better not do it.”

And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack.
Or they’re doing it surgically, at least.
Saved a lot of people.
We do a lot of good work.
This administration does a tremendous job, and we don’t get credit for it.
But I think the people understand what we do.
So Prime Minister Abe gave me — I mean, it’s the most beautiful five letter — five-page letter.
Nobel Prize.
He sent it to them.
You know why?
Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.
And they had alarms going off; you know that.
Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe.
I did that.
And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.
Fire and fury.
Total annihilation.
“My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.”  Remember that?
You don’t remember that.
And people said, “Trump is crazy.”  And you know what it ended up being?
A very good relationship.
I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.
Nobody else would have done that.
The Obama administration couldn’t have done it.
Number one, they probably wouldn’t have done it.
And number two, they didn’t have the capability to do it.
So I just want to thank everybody.
I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life.
(Laughter.)
Bill, good luck.
A tremendous reputation.
I know you’ll do a great job.
Thank you very much.
And thank you, everybody.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
SPEECH 10: President Trump’s U.N. Press Conference - Sept. 26, 2018

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody.
We’ve had a great three days at the United Nations in New York.
And this is quite a gathering.
Wow.
It’s a lot of people.
A lot of media.
(Laughter.)
We’ve covered a great deal of territory.
Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan.
We’re starting trade talks with Japan.
They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now they’re willing to talk trade.
And I’m sure we’ll make a very good deal.
Just concluded, as you know — two days ago, signed a deal with South Korea — a trade deal.
A tremendous deal with South Korea.
It means a lot of business for our farmers.
We’re opening up for farmers.
We’re opening up for a lot of different groups.
We’re going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before.
And so we’re very happy with that.
That deal is actually concluded.
We’re very well along the way with Mexico.
The relationship is very good.
And with Canada, we’ll see what happens.
They’re charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products.
We can’t have that.
We can’t have that.
With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today.
They would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.
But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies.
And China is not open, but we’re open to them.
They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country.
Cars, they’re at 25 percent.
And we’re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent, and don’t even collect it.
But we collect it now.
So we’re doing very well in our situation with China on trade.
I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi.
But it’s got to be a two-way street.
It — for 25 years and longer, it was not.
And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China.
We just can’t have that.
We have to make it fair.
So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest.
And a lot of money is coming into our coffers.
And it’s had no impact on our — absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t.
In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is.
If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers.
They dump massive amounts of steel.
They want to put the steel companies out of business.
And after they’re out of business, they’ll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.
And we need steel and we need aluminum.
And those industries are doing well.
But steel is incredible.
U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.
Nucor is opening up plants.
And these are big plants — $750 million and a billion dollar plants, in some cases.
So what’s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.
It’s being rebuilt overnight.
If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG — Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible.
They’re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.
They’re taking the LNG and they’re doubling it up.
I said, “You have to do me a favor.
We don’t want these big deficits.
You’re going to have to buy more.”  They’re buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing.
Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody.
It’s a rare exception that we don’t.
So we are doing great as a country.
Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well.
I’m not happy about that, because I know it’s going to be a question.
I am not happy about that.
I’d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs.
So I’m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.
We can do other things with the money.
And — but they raised them.
And they’re raising them because we’re doing so well.
You know, we’re doing much better than I had projected in terms of — when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and we’re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.
And, I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on.
They were going to put regulations on.
They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse.
And they were going to raise your taxes.
That’s what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I don’t think they’ll have control for a long time.
So, with that being said, we’ll take some questions and — yes, please.
John, go ahead.
We have plenty of time.
Q    Mr. President, thank you very much.
Of course, what you’re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh —

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
Q    — before the Judiciary Committee.
In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas’s background investigation — not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation.
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.
Right.
Q    When these allegations were raised, why didn’t this White House do the same thing?
And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the FBI told us they’ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years.
They know him very well.
But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint.
They didn’t know the location.
They didn’t know the time.
They didn’t know the year.
They didn’t know anything.
And it’s like, where do you go?
Also, it’s not for the FBI.
If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, “They don’t do this.”  And he said it very clearly.
So I think when you really look at it all, it’s not going to change any of the Democrats’ minds.
They’re obstructionists.
They’re actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they’ve destroyed a man’s reputation and they want to destroy it even more.
And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.
What they’ve done to this family, what they’ve done to these children — these beautiful children of his — and what they’ve done to his wife.
And they know it’s a big, fat con job.
And they go into a room and, I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they’ve pulled off on you and on the public.
They laugh like hell.
So, it wouldn’t have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score.
And you understand that very well, John.
If they would have come back with the most perfect — “We found everything, and he’s perfectly innocent of everything.”  It wouldn’t have made a difference.
You wouldn’t have gotten one vote.
Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win.
You’ll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they’re in states that I won by 30 and 40 points and they’re going to give us votes.
But other than that, you probably won’t get any, John.
Yes, go ahead.
Please.
Q    Mr. President, there are now three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Are you saying that all three of those women are liars?
Is there anything that can be said at this point tomorrow —

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
Q    — that could cause you to withdraw the nomination?
Anything at all that —

THE PRESIDENT:  I won’t get into that game.
I’ll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I’ve ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing.
And these are all false — to me, these are false accusations in certain cases.
And certain cases, even the media agrees with that.
I can only say that, what they’ve done to this man is incredible.
You know, it’s very interesting — I pick a lot of judges.
I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasn’t big on picking judges.
When I got there, I said, “How is this possible?”  I have 145 — including court of appeals — judges.
And they just didn’t do it.
You know why?
They got tired.
They got complacent.
Something happened.
I have 145 judges.
Everybody wants to be a federal judge.
Not just a Supreme Court judge, I’m talking about court of appeals; I’m talking about district court.
I don’t think they’re going to want to so much.
I’ll be calling people, and we’ll have people calling people that do this.
And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, “Thirty-five years ago, you met some…” — and you might know — you might not know what’s going on.
What is going on?
Why did they wait so long?
Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case?
Why didn’t she bring it right at the beginning?
When you ask about, as an example, the FBI — why didn’t they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing?
You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI.
It would have been fine.
Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times.
And they did a very thorough investigation.
But this is a big con job.
And I would love to be in the room with the Democrats, close the door — you guys are all away, outside, waiting.
And Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all.
Let’s just stop them.
A big fat con.
Yeah, go ahead.
Q    But, Mr. President, if I could follow up.
You have daughters.
Can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time?
Don’t you understand —

THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, I only say this: thirty-six years — no charge, no nothing.
Everybody —

Q    But — but that happens often.
I mean —

THE PRESIDENT:  People are going to have to make a decision.
Thirty-six years, there’s no charge.
All of a sudden, the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out.
And then you have this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.
I only say that you have to look at the facts.
The senators are very capable people.
They’re very good people.
I know many of them.
They’re friends of mine.
These are very talented, very good people.
And they’re going to vote.
They’re going to believe what they believe.
I can — when I look at what’s happened to the reputation of a great gentleman — a great intellect; a brilliant man; somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court Justices in history, intellectually — I think it’s a shame.
Yes, please.
Q    Yes, Mr. President.
My name is Tomás Regalado from Radio and TV Marti.
Mr. President, yesterday at the speech at the U.N., you spoke about how Venezuela’s problem was because of Cuba and the Castros — how they went in there and they brought socialism and communism to Venezuela, and now to Nicaragua as well.
Mr. President, are you going to be more proactive now against Cuba as well?
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been very proactive against Cuba.
I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba.
As you know, President Obama gave them a pass and I didn’t like it.
Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.
I don’t like what he did.
I’ve ended much of it — most of it.
I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba, and I certainly don’t like what’s happening in Venezuela.
Yes, please.
Q    Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    Mr. President, just to finish really fast.
You said also that you had a call-to-action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism.
Would you like to be recognized as —

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I wouldn’t say that socialism has bene working really well around the world, okay.
You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one — your number one — I guess, the one that is most obvious.
But you take a look around the world, socialism is not exactly riding high.
Please.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    Thank you very much.
If you don’t mind, after I’m finished, if Weijia, or Hallie, or Vivian, or one of our female colleagues could go after me, that would be great.
Mr. President, just to follow up on these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh —

THE PRESIDENT:  What does he mean by that?
Explain.
What does that mean?
Q    I think it would be great if a female reporter —

THE PRESIDENT:  What does it mean?
No, what does it mean?
Q    I think it would great if a female reporter would ask you a question about this issue.
So if you don’t mind, I would ask —

THE PRESIDENT:  I wouldn’t mind that at all.
No.
Wouldn’t mind it at all.
Q    All right.
Well, let me — if I could call on —

THE PRESIDENT:  Wouldn’t make any difference to me.
Q    All right.
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    If I could follow up on John, and John’s question.
Why is it, Mr. President, that you always seem to side with the accused and not the accuser?
You have three women here who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be heard.
And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to, time and again, side with the accused and not the accuser.
Is that because of the many allegations that you’ve had made against you over the years?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I wasn’t happy with Roy Moore.
Let’s get that straight.
But Roy Moore was a Republican candidate —

Q    But you stood by him.
THE PRESIDENT:  — and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win.
I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him.
As far as women, whether it’s a man or a woman, these are — you know, it can happen the other way.
Allegations can go the other way also.
You understand that.
And whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years ago — in fact, they don’t even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is.
That’s a long time.
And I could pick, as an example — hopefully I won’t have to do it as a replacement because hopefully this is going to go very well on Thursday.
It’s going to go very well on Monday, or Saturday, or Sunday, or whenever they vote.
But I could pick a woman and she could have charges made from many years ago also.
Q    But don’t you understand, sir, that many of these —

THE PRESIDENT:    And I would look at the character —

Q    — many of these accusers —

THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I have to do —

Q    — are reluctant to come forward.
You’ve raised doubts about these accusers.
Many of them are reluctant to come forward.
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think people are reluctant to come forward.
They’re going to have a chance to speak at a major — they have a major chance to speak.
Q    But you’re saying why (inaudible) —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.
Excuse me.
They have a major chance to speak.
And it will be tomorrow, I assume.
We’ve delayed this — meaning the Republican senators, not me.
The Republicans senators have delayed this for weeks now.
They’re giving the women a major chance to speak.
Now it’s possible I’ll hear that, and I’ll say, “Hey, I’m changing my mind.”  That is possible.
We want to give them a chance to speak.
And they’re given —

Q    Do you think all three should have a chance — all three should have a chance to speak?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, whoever is given a chance.
We’ve delayed it a long time.
But they’re going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case.
And you know what?
I could be persuaded also.
Okay?
Yes.
Please.
Please, go ahead.
Go ahead.
I would like to go — yes, go ahead.
Please.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
And a couple of questions for you to follow up on some answers that I didn’t quite hear from you, if you would allow me a couple of questions.
First of all, do you think these women — all three of them are liars?
Yes or no?
THE PRESIDENT:  Have they been what?
Q    Are they liars?
THE PRESIDENT:  I can’t tell you.
I have to watch tomorrow.
I have to read.
I just heard about one a little while ago.
I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay?
So I can’t tell you whether or not they’re liars until I hear them.
I don’t know what happened today because I’ve been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with China, and about seven other countries, as you know — and I chaired the Security Council.
So I don’t know about today’s person that came forward.
I do know about the lawyer.
And you don’t get much worse — bad reputation, too.
Take a look at his past.
So, as far as the other women are concerned, I’m going to see what happens tomorrow.
I’m going to be watching — you know, believe it or not.
I’m going to see what’s said.
It’s possible that they will be convincing.
Now, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington.
He’s been on — I guess you’d call it the second highest court.
And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well.
And those people don’t believe what’s going on.
I can always be convinced.
I have to hear it.
Q    It sounds like what you’re saying is, there is a situation, there is a scenario under which you would withdraw Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination.
Is that correct?
And have you talked about that with him?
THE PRESIDENT:  If I thought he was — if I thought he was guilty of something like this, yeah sure.
Q    And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?
THE PRESIDENT:  I want to watch.
I want to see.
I hope I can watch.
I’m meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch.
And I’ll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican senators who — look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, “We have George Washington,” the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand.
And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know.
(Laughter.)
He may have had some, I think, accusations made.
Didn’t he have a couple of things in his past?
George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists.
I mean 100 percent.
One hundred percent.
So it really doesn’t matter from their standpoint.
That’s why when John asked about the FBI — if the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI, and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.
Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you’re going to get some votes from the Democrats.
You know why?
Because — we all know why — because it’s called politics.
Then you’ll probably get some votes.
Okay, let’s go.
Q    And my final question, sir,

THE PRESIDENT: One more question.
Yes.
Q    Just to follow up —

THE PRESIDENT:  She stands up: “I’d like to ask about three questions.”  It’s not really fair to everyone else.
Q    This will be my last one —

THE PRESIDENT:  Should I let her ask another question?
(Crosstalk.)
Q    — to follow up on —

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
See?
Q    — to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like Roy Moore, to Roger Ailes, to Bill O’Reilly, to Brett Kavanaugh.
They’re all men.
Why is that?
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s not a benefit of the doubt.
I’ve —

Q    Has there ever been an instance when you’ve given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve known them.
Hallie, I’ve know them for a long time and — a lot of these people.
A lot of people.
And some I’ve been disappointed with.
I have been disappointed with some.
Others, like — you know, there are charges that are pretty weak.
But I’ve known people for a long time.
I never saw them do anything wrong.
I never saw them do anything wrong.
And there are some that probably — I agree.
I can tell you there are some that I — I’ve been watching for a long time.
And in a couple of cases, they weren’t Republicans.
In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite.
But I’ve been watching them for a long time.
And I knew for a long time these were not good people.
And they were never brought up.
Okay.
Yes, ma’am.
Go ahead.
Thank you very much by the way.
Thank you.
Q    Thank you very much, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Q    When the allegations first surfaced, you initially said how important it was for Dr. Ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her.
THE PRESIDENT:  I do.
Q    But —

THE PRESIDENT:  I wish it could have gone quicker.
Q    Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely her or her parents would have reported it.
And just today, you said, you wouldn’t —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, there is a truth.
I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.
Q    So my question is —

THE PRESIDENT:  It doesn’t mean they had to report it because, in some instances, people keep it quiet.
It’s a very tough situation for a woman, there’s no question about it.
And in some cases, they do report it.
Frankly, had they reported it, it would’ve been pretty amazing, wouldn’t it?
But I guess they didn’t, and that’s okay.
I’m not saying they had to report it because it’s a very personal thing.
It’s a very big problem, there’s no question about it.
Go ahead.
Q    But do you want to hear her story before you draw a conclusion —

THE PRESIDENT:  I’d like to hear her story, yeah.
Well, we’re giving her a time.
Q    — or have you already made up your mind?
THE PRESIDENT:  They would’ve given her time last week.
This is the United States Senate.
This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far.
I’ve actually heard it’s the most important decision a President can make.
I disagree with that.
War and peace — I always say, “War and peace.”  And after that, Supreme Court Justice.
Right?
I look forward to hearing from her.
We could’ve heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time.
It’ll be interesting to hear what she has to say.
Okay?
Q    And let me follow up on Jim’s question.
Mr. President, let me follow up on Jim’s question that I don’t think we got an answer to.
THE PRESIDENT:  Which one?
Which question?
Who?
Q    How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct —

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been accused.
I’ve been accused.
False accusations.
Q    — right, how have those —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.
I’ve been accused.
And I was accused by — I believe, it was — four women.
You can check with Sean Hannity.
You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly — who got paid.
Q    And how has (inaudible) —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.
We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television.
They refused to even write about it.
There were four women, and maybe more — I think the number is four or five.
But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000.
Another one had other things happen.
And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me — and she is the one that reported it.
This woman is incredible.
She reported it, instead of taking the money.
So I’ve had numerous accusations about me.
Q    Right.
THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false.
I never met them.
I never met these people.
And, what did they do?
What did they do?
They took money in order to say bad things.
I’ve had stories written in the New York Times — front page — about four women.
The whole top center front page of the New York Times.
I think it was four big pictures.
I said, “Wow.
That’s a big thing.
What’s that?”  These were women that were quoted saying bad things about me.
Not the worst things about me, but bad things.
And I said, “Gee, that’s too bad.”  I knew them a long time ago — 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
I said, “That’s too bad.
I’m surprised at them.”

And then all of a sudden I see them on television — nothing to do with me.
The next day or a day later, they were incensed.
They said, “Donald Trump is a nice guy.
We never said this.
The New York Times did false reporting.
They’re fake news.”  And you know what?
The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.
These women said great things.
Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me.
Front page.
And those women — they’re incredible women — they went on television — and they didn’t want to, and I didn’t ask them.
And they said, “The New York Times made it up.
They gave false quotes.”  And they went on a lot of shows.
They were really incensed and they couldn’t believe it.
That’s why people know that a lot of the news is fake.
And a lot of the people sitting here are fake.
But 20 percent of them are wonderful.
Okay?
Q    If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump.
I — you didn’t let me ask my question.
THE PRESIDENT:  You’ve been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?
Q    No, you interrupted my question.
THE PRESIDENT:  Please sit down.
Please.
Q    I’m asking you —

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Q    — how did those impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it does impact my opinion.
You know why?
Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me.
I’m a very famous person, unfortunately.
I’ve been a famous person for a long time.
But I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me — really false charges.
I know friends that have had false charges.
People want fame.
They want money.
They want whatever.
So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, “Oh, Judge Kavanaugh…” this or that.
It’s happened to me many times.
I’ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane.
And I have a number-one bestseller out?
I mean it was total phony story.
There are many of them.
So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh?
Absolutely.
Because I’ve had it many times.
And if the news would have reported these four people — I couldn’t believe it.
When I heard that they caught these four people, I said, “Wow.
That’s a big story.”  And it was — for Fox.
Okay.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese government.
You suggested that the Chinese —

THE PRESIDENT:  I did.
Q    — had meddled in or are meddling in —

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.
That’s what I hear.
Q    — the 2018 midterm elections.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s what I hear.
Q    What evidence do you have of that, sir?
Is there a national intelligence estimate, for example, that you’re prepared to put forward?
THE PRESIDENT:  We have evidence.
We have evidence.
It’ll come out.
Yeah, I can’t tell you now, but it came — it didn’t come out of nowhere, that I can tell you.
Now, if you — they’ve actually admitted that they’re going after farmers.
I mean, I think most of you can cover that.
I like that you’re shaking your head, “yes.”  I’m going to ask you the next question because of that.
Okay?
It’s probably going to be the killer of all questions.
(Laughter.)
But let me just explain —

Q    But why make the charges now —

THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no.
Let me —

Q    — if you’re not prepared to come forward with the evidence, sir?
THE PRESIDENT:  China, now, put on $250 billion, and they’re paying 25 percent on that.
They’re paying billions and billions.
This has never happened to China.
And I like China.
And I like President Xi a lot.
I think he’s a friend of mine.
He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he — I think he probably respects —

From what I hear — if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China — he was on a good show — I won’t mention the name of the show — recently.
And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump’s very, very large brain.
He said, “Donald.
Donald Trump.
They don’t know what to do.”  It never happened.
Well, one thing they are trying to do is they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump.
Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he’s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country.
I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge.
They’re building things that we don’t build anymore.
But we’re starting to build them again.
And our economy now is hotter than it’s ever been.
I don’t know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out.
Fantastic.
And in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, they’re raising rates because we’ve never done like we’re doing now.
And one of the things that is nice about the rates — the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know —

When President Obama had an economy that was — it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that — you’ve all heard that.
But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money.
He was playing with funny money.
That’s easy.
I’m playing with fairly expensive money.
So when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually — in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank.
Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank.
They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest.
Now, those people are starting to get interest.
And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to — you know, they did a great job.
The people that did it right, the people that did the best job got hurt the most.
So in one sense I like it, but basically I’m a low-interest-rate person.
I hate to tell you.
Yes.
Yes, ma’am.
Yes.
Yes, go ahead.
Q    Mr. President, you have another meeting tomorrow with Rod Rosenstein.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
Q    Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m talking to him.
We’ve had a good talk.
He said he never said it.
He said he doesn’t believe it.
He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice and we’ll see.
And he’s a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it’s the Justice Department.
I would certainly prefer not doing that.
There was no collusion.
There was no obstruction — I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back.
I do fight back.
I really fight back.
I mean, if you call that obstruction, that’s fine.
But there’s no obstruction.
There’s no collusion.
I’m going to meet with him tomorrow.
I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don’t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick.
So I don’t want it competing and hurting the decision — one way or the other decision.
Again, I want to hear what she has to say.
But I want to do — so I may delay that.
I’m going to see.
I don’t want to do anything that’s going to conflict with that.
But my preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up.
You know, I call it a “witch hunt.”  And it is a witch hunt.
If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page.
If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI.
If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who’s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And he’s in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run — she lost — to run.
I mean, what’s going on?
If you look at the horrible statements, like “Way to go, Page.
Great story you put into a newspaper.”  Essentially, now we’ll go and investigate that group.
It’s terrible.
We have caught people doing things that are terrible.
I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein.
Much prefer.
Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him.
He said he did not say it.
He said he does not believe that.
And nobody in this room believes it.
By the way, I deal with the people in this room.
I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan.
And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood.
And I said them a long time ago, and I was right.
He said, “That’s not the 25th Amendment that I’m looking at.”  I think I can say that from Mike.
Q    So you don’t think anyone in your administration has ever discussed using the 25th Amendment against you?
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think so.
Well, yeah — enemies, sure.
You use anything you can.
Q    Was it in your administration or your Cabinet?
THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, you use anything they can.
They’re not in love with me.
They’re not going to beat me in the election; they know that.
They’re not going to beat me.
The people that I’m looking at are total lightweights.
I dream of running against those people.
Q    But within your administration?
THE PRESIDENT:  Maybe they’ll come up with somebody that’s not — they’re not going to beat me.
I’m against what they want to do.
I’m in favor of law enforcement.
I’m in favor of safety and security, and low taxes.
I want low taxes.
I want borders.
We’re getting another $1.6 billion in borders.
I want borders.
We’ve spent $3.2 [billion] and we’re getting another $1.6 [billion].
And then eventually, we’re getting the whole thing and we’ll complete the wall.
They don’t want that.
They don’t want that.
They don’t want the things that I have.
Now, I must say, I know many of the Democrats.
They’ll say things and then wink at me.
And again, it’s the same old story.
They’ll say things; they don’t mean it.
Its politics.
The reason they don’t want me is because they want to run the show.
They want it.
It’s power.
It’s whatever you want to call it.
But what they’ve done here is a disgrace.
A total disgrace.
And what they do — I know, it’s sort of interesting — in one case, they say, “He’s a fascist.
He’s taking over the government.
He’s the most powerful President ever.
He’s a horrible human being.
He wants to take over the entire government, and he’s going to do it.
We can’t stop him.”  That didn’t work.
The next week, he said, “Uh, he’s incompetent.”  I said, “Well, wait a minute.”  In one case, I’m taking over the world.
And in the other case, “He’s incompetent.”  They tried that for a week.
That didn’t work.
Look, these are very dishonest people.
These are con artists.
And the press knows it, but the press doesn’t write it.
Wow.
That’s a lot of hands.
That’s a lot of — oh, Steve, go ahead.
He is a very high quality person, this man.
But he’ll probably hit me with a bad one.
(Laughter.)
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
Why —

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Give it to me.
Give it to me, Steve.
Reuters.
Q    You’re getting letters from Chairman Kim.
Why do you need a second summit with the North Korean leader so soon?
And what do you —

THE PRESIDENT:  Because he’d like it.
Q    What would it be for?
THE PRESIDENT:  So I’ve received two letters from Chairman Kim.
At some point, I’ll, you know, give these letters — they’re incredible letters.
They’re letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done.
I really believe he wants to get it done.
I may be wrong.
I heard somebody on a certain network last night — I won’t mention which one — say, “Why has President Trump given so much to North Korea?”  I said, “Wait a minute.”  I asked Sarah Huckabee, “Please call this person.”  I gave nothing — other than I met.
What did I give them?
I didn’t do what Obama did:  Give them $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages.
I got back our hostages; I never paid them anything.
I haven’t paid them 10 cents.
But he wants to make a deal and I’d like to make a deal.
We actually have a very good relationship together — a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations.
That was a little bit rough.
Don’t forget, that time, they said, “Oh, Trump is saying these horrible things.
He’s going to get us into a war.”  You were going to have a war.
If I wasn’t elected, you’d be in war.
And President Obama essentially said the same thing.
He was ready to go to war.
You would have had a war, and you would have lost millions, not thousands.
You would have lost millions of people.
Seoul has 30 million people — 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border.
If I wasn’t elected, you would have had a war.
President Obama thought you had to go to war.
You know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war?
Millions of people.
With me, nobody is talking about that.
Nobody is talking about that.
We have a very good relationship.
He likes me.
I like him.
We get along.
He wrote me two of the most beautiful letters.
When I showed one of the letters — just one — to Prime Minister Abe, he said, “This is actually a groundbreaking letter.
This is an incredible — this is a historic letter.”  And it is a historic letter.
It’s a beautiful — it’s a beautiful piece of art.
And I think we’re going to make a deal.
Will we make a deal, Steve?
I don’t really know.
But I think we’re going to.
In the meantime — and I’ve said it a thousand — I don’t want to bore you: no rockets, no missiles, no nuclear tests — you know, for over a year, where you haven’t seen.
Before I got here, everybody in this room thought you were going to war.
And then what happened — it was funny — they said, “He was terrible.
He was so rough with Chairman Kim — Kim Jong Un.
He was so rough.
It’s terrible.
He’s going to cause…”

Well, I had a great meeting with President Putin.
And on that one, they said, “He was too soft with President Putin.”  I had a great meeting with the President.
It lasted for two hours.
We discussed everything: Ukraine, Syria, Israel and Israel’s protection.
We had a great meeting.
They wanted me to end up in a boxing match.
And you know what?
If I was killer-tough with President Putin, they would have said, “He was too tough.”  You can’t win with these people, but you just keep going.
In the meantime, we’re doing well.
Go ahead.
Q    So how do you — how long do you —

THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.
One second.
Q    How long do you think it should take North Korea to denuclearize?
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.
I don’t want to get into —

Q    We’ve seen estimates of one year, two year —

THE PRESIDENT:  Steve, I don’t want to get into the time game.
You know why?
I told Mike Pompeo, I said, “Mike, don’t get into the time game.”  We stopped them.
They’re taking down plants.
They’re taking down a lot of different testing areas.
They’re going to take down some more.
You’ll be hearing about that very soon.
I don’t want to go ahead of myself, but you’ll be hearing about it soon.
They have no interest right now in testing nuclear.
You know, we had a case just about when I was coming into office — you all remember it — where there was a massive — they thought it was an earthquake.
A mountain moved over an inch and a half.
We’re talking about mountains.
You know, North Korea is very mountainous.
Beautiful land.
Beautiful.
This mountain actually shifted.
It shifted.
And somebody thought it was an earthquake.
And then they found out, no, this was nuclear testing.
Shifted a mountain.
Now I’m talking about serious stuff.
Serious size.
When I came in, and certainly before I came in — and even at the beginning of mine because when I was having rhetorical contests — you know, contests, really, I guess you could call it — with Chairman Kim, which we both smile at now and we laugh at.
But everybody thought that was a horrible thing.
We’ve had — many Presidents were unable to do anything, anything at all with North Korea.
We now have a good relationship.
We have a good relationship.
And most importantly, all of the things that you’ve been hearing about –the horror stories — in my opinion, they’re gone.
Now, could they start up again?
Yes.
I’m a deal guy.
Could they start?
Yeah.
Could be that we don’t work it out.
I think — I have it right here — I think that what we’ve done behind the scenes, which nobody really knows about — and I don’t blame you for not knowing about, you know, personal letters, private letters.
But saying they want to get it done.
We know much more than the media for a change.
Much more.
But if you saw what’s going on behind the scenes, I think you’d very impressed.
We were a country going to war.
I really believe that President Obama would admit that he said it’s by far his biggest problem.
When I sat with him, prior to going to office — going into office, he said to me that’s by far the biggest problem.
And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.
And millions of people — not — you know, I — they say, “Oh, thousands of people…”  No, no, no, not thousands.
Millions of people would have been killed.
And that could have left — you’re right next to China.
You’re right — that could have been a world war very easily.
Right now, we’re in a great position.
I don’t want to play the time game.
I told Mike Pompeo, “Don’t let them do that to you.”  I haven’t given anything.
And all of a sudden — we got back, it was a few weeks ago.
I think we were back like two and a half months from the summit, which was a great success.
And people are screaming, “What’s taking so long?”  I said, “Oh, I get it.”  You got to understand the media.
I’ve been dealing with the media all my life.
Too much.
Too much.
They’re screaming and I saw that.
And our guys were — and not Mike — but our guys were being, “Oh well, we’re working as fast…”  I said, “I got all the time in the world.
I don’t have to rush it.”  There’s no — you know, secession of sanctions.
We got the sanctions on.
I didn’t take any sanctions off.
I did see a reporter last night — a guy I like, personally, a lot.
And he asked a question to President Moon of South Korea.
He said, “Why did the President give so much?”  I didn’t give anything.
I gave nothing.
What have I given, other than some time?
Yes, I flew to Singapore.
We had a meeting.
Now, giving would be if I took the sanctions off.
I didn’t want to do — if you asked General Mattis, for a year and a half, I said, “Why don’t we stop these ridiculous,” in my opinion, “the military games?”  I call them the “military games.”  If I told you how much those games cost — and, frankly, I told South Korea, “You should be paying for these games.”  We pay for them.
They say, “Well, we fly the planes in from a short distance away.”  I said, “Where is that?”  “Guam.”  “Oh, huh.
How long a trip is that?”  “Seven hours.”  “Oh, great.”  We’re flying these massive bombers and everything.
I’ve wanted to stop this for a long time.
I consider that an asset.
But we’ve done — we’re saving, by the way — just for the taxpayer, we’re saving a fortune.
And if we need them, we can start them up immediately.
If I think we need them, I’ll start them before the generals will start them.
The fact is, this reporter said that.
I said, “What have we done?
I haven’t given anything.”  And we’re really onto the cusp.
I think we’re really going to do something that’s going to be very important.
But we’re not playing the time game.
If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.
There’s no nuclear testing and there’s no testing of rockets.
Yes, ma’am.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Please.
Q    Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  This is the one that was nodding with every nice thing I said, so watch this question.
Q    It’s a habit of mine.
Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
THE PRESIDENT:  You’re with who?
Q    Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.
Sky News.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Congratulations on the purchase.
(Laughter.)
Q    Nothing to do with me.
THE PRESIDENT:  I hope you benefited.
(Laughter.)
Go ahead.
Q    Are you at all concerned at the message that has been sending — being sent to the women who are watching this when you use language like “con job” in relation to allegations of sexual assault?
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I’ve used much worse language in my life than “con job.”  That’s like probably the nicest phrase I’ve ever used.
I mean, con job — it is.
It’s a con job.
You know, confidence — it’s a confidence job.
But they short — it’s a con job by the Democrats.
They know it.
Q    What about the message that’s being sent to women who are watching?
THE PRESIDENT:  They did the same thing with the Russia investigation.
They tried to convince people that I had something to do with Russia.
There was no collusion.
Think of it.
I’m in Wisconsin.
I’m in Michigan.
I say, “Gee, we’re not doing well.”  I won both those states.
“We’re not doing well.
Uh, let me call the Russians to help.”  Does anybody really believe that?
It’s a con job.
And I watch these guys — Little Adam Schiff, and all of the guys.
He takes a call from a Russian who turned out to be a faker.
You know, he was a comedian or something.
“This is so-and-so calling for…” — he took the call.
Why is the taking a call from a Russian?
Senator Warner took a call from a Russian.
He was a comedian or something, but he said, “We have pictures of President Trump.”  “Oh, where can I get them?”  If we ever did that, it would be like a big deal.
Yeah, it’s a con job.
And it’s not a bad term.
It’s not a bad term at all.
Q    Are you worried —

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll tell you one thing I can say: I’ve had a lot of people talking about this to me, with respect to what’s happening, because it’s a horrible precedent.
I’m going to have to get other judges and other Supreme Court judges, possibly.
I could have a lot of the Supreme Court judges, more than two.
And when I called up Brett Kavanaugh — spoke to him and his family — and told them that I chose them, they were so happy and so honored.
It was as though — I mean, the biggest thing that’s ever happened.
And I understand that — U.S. Supreme Court.
I don’t want to be in a position where people say, “No, thanks.
No, thanks.
I don’t want to.”  You know, “I spoke to somebody 38 years ago, and it may not be good.”  We have a country to run.
We want the best talent in the world.
But I’ll tell you this:  The people that have complained to me about it the most — about what’s happening — are women.
Women are very angry.
You know, I got 52 percent with women.
Everyone said, “This couldn’t happen — 52 percent.”  Women are so angry.
And I, frankly, think that — I think they like what the Republicans are doing, but I think they would have liked to have seen it go a lot faster.
But give them their day in court.
Let her have her day in court.
Let somebody else have a day in court.
But the ones that I find — I mean, I have men that don’t like it, but I have women that are incensed at what’s going on.
I’ve always said women are smarter than men.
I’ve said that a lot and I mean it.
But women are incensed at what’s going on.
Yes, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, in the back.
Q    Sorry.
It’s me?
THE PRESIDENT:  Who are you?
Or where are you from?
Q    It’s me?
It’s me?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, you.
(Laughter.)
The guy looks — guy looks like he’s shocked.
That’s not — this is going to be not good.
Q    It’s going to be good, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  The guy looks totally like stunned that I — have you ever been picked before for a question?
(Laughter.)
Q    Yes, sir, but not from President of the United States.
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Give me a question.
Q    Thank you very much.
My name is Majeed Gly from Rudaw Media Network.
I want to, sir, ask you — you always talk about —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, you said where?
From where?
Q    Rudaw Media Network from Kurdistan region, north of Iraq.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.
Q    I’m a Kurd.
Sir —

THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
Good.
Great people.
Q    Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great people.
Q    (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Thank you.
Q    Mr. President.
Mr. President, I want to —

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Are you a Kurd?
Q    (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
Q    Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT:  They’re great people.
They’re great fighters.
I like them a lot.
Let’s go.
I like this question so far.
Q    Mr. President, you always say you support your allies.
Kurds right now, after the defeat of ISIS, are under a lot of pressure in Syria and in Iraq by many adversaries.
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s true.
Q    What will you do to elevate their position to support them in order — after they help the United States to defeat ISIS?
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we are helping them a lot and we’ve been very friendly with them.
And, as you know, we’ve fought side-by-side.
And we have defeated ISIS, essentially, a very short while ago, in the Middle East.
And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds.
And they are — they’re great fighters.
You know, some people are great fighters and some people aren’t.
The Kurds are great fighters.
And they’re great, great people.
And we’re going to be working — we’re discussing that situation exactly right now.
Q    What will you do to support them, sir, (inaudible) Syria?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m just telling you, we’re going to be discussing that situation.
We have already started discussing that situation.
But we have tremendous support from the Kurds in defeating ISIS.
Okay?
Q    And about Syria:  Sir, in your speech you did not mention —

THE PRESIDENT:  Uh, yes.
Go.
Uh oh.
Q    Here we go.
(Laughs.)
THE PRESIDENT:  You don’t need it.
Q    Mr. President, Susan Li from Fox Business.
Did you reject a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I did.
Q    Why?
THE PRESIDENT:  Because his tariffs are too high, and he doesn’t seem to want to move, and I’ve told him, “Forget about it.”  And frankly, we’re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada.
That’s the motherlode.
That’s the big one.
We’re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.
We don’t like their representative very much.
They’ve taken advantage — I love Canada, by the way.
I have so many friends.
I have everybody, and so many friends.
But that has nothing to do with this; I’m representing the United States.
Mexico was totally — I mean, they were great.
By the way, the new President has been great.
The deal is done.
Now, it has to go through Congress and, you know, a lot things have to happen.
But we’ve done — Bob Lighthizer, who’s here someplace.
Where’s Bob?
Bob.
Bob Lighthizer has done a great job of negotiating, as they have.
But the deal is done.
It’s up to Congress.
Q    And, Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT:  But Canada has treated us very badly.
They’ve treated our farmers in Wisconsin, and New York state, and a lot of other states very badly.
Dairy products — 300 percent.
Three hundred percent.
How do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent?
The answer is:  You don’t.
What it is, is a barrier.
It’s — basically, they’re saying, “We don’t have any barriers.
By the way, it’s 300 percent.”  So you don’t send it in, because you can’t compete.
So Canada has a long way to go.
I must be honest with you, we’re not getting along at all with their negotiators.
We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.
We had people that didn’t know what they were doing.
And that’s why we had — over the last five or six years, if you average it out, we had $800 billion a year in trade losses.
It’s ridiculous.
It’s not going to happen.
Q    What about NAFTA?
Sir, Mr. President, NAFTA —

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    What does that mean for NAFTA?
Will you be pulling out of NAFTA?
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t like NAFTA.
I never liked it.
It’s been very bad for the United States.
It’s been great for Canada.
It’s been great for Mexico.
Very bad for us.
Q    But will you pull out of the —

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to use the name “NAFTA.”  I refuse to use it.
I’ve seen thousands of plants and factories close.
I’ve seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved.
I mean, Mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of NAFTA.
Under our deal, it’s not going to happen anymore.
I hate to tell you, it’s not.
We’re going to keep companies.
And I told the Mexicans, I said, “We have to keep companies.”  But they’re getting a lot, also.
They’re getting other things.
They’re getting a lot of good things.
Mexico made a very good deal.
But with Canada, it’s very tough.
What we’re doing is if we made a deal with Canada — which is, you know, a good chance still.
But I’m not making anything near what they want to do.
We’re going to be fair.
Q    But you’re — are you going to notify Congress of pulling out of NAFTA?
THE PRESIDENT:  What we’re probably going to do is call it the “USMC.”  Like the United States Marine Corps, which I love.
General Kelly likes it even more.
Where’s General Kelly?
He likes that.
“USMC” — which would be U.S., Mexico, Canada.
But it’ll probably or possibly be just “USM.”  It’ll be United States and Mexico.
Q    Yes or no, are you going to —

THE PRESIDENT:  Canada will come along.
Now, if Canada doesn’t make a deal with us, we’re going to make a much better deal.
We’re going to tax the cars that come in.
We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury.
And frankly, we’ll be very happy because it’s actually more money than you can make, under any circumstance, with making a deal.
Okay?
Good job, too.
You do a very good job.
Really good.
Yes, please.
Mr. Kurd.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
(Laughter.)
(Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    Thank you very much for your time, Mr. President.
Two, quickly, questions:  What will be the U.S.A. relations with the Kurds —

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I thought I just answered that.
Q    — post-ISIS.
Post-ISIS.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.
We’re trying to get along very well.
We do get along great with the Kurds.
We’re trying to help them a lot.
Don’t forget, that’s their territory.
Q    (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  We have to help them.
I want to help them.
Go ahead, what’s next?
Q    Then, what —

THE PRESIDENT:  They fought with us.
They fought with us.
They died with us.
They died.
We lost — tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS.
They died for us and with us.
And for themselves.
They died for themselves.
But they’re great people.
And we have not forget — we don’t forget — I don’t forget.
What happens someday later — but I can tell you that I don’t forget.
These are great people.
Okay.
Yes, ma’am.
Please.
Please —

Q    About Iran, Mr. President.
About Iran, one question: What is your clear plan to stop Iranian influence in Iraq, in Syria, and especially in Iraqi Kurdistan?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think you’ve seen that.
I must tell you, it’s — I don’t mind your question because —

Q    Raheem Rashidi, from Kurdistan TV.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  I think there’s been no greater change — other than maybe China, because China — unfortunately, their markets have dropped — would you say, 30 percent in the last four months, right?
I think I watched you recently when you said that.
I said, “I think she’s wrong.
I think it’s actually 32.
But that’s okay.”  But a lot.
There’s been no — other than maybe that, but even that.
Because China is a very special place.
And Iran is a very special place.
But I think there’s been no country that’s changed so much as Iran.
In the last six months, since I took off the horrible, horrible Iran nuclear deal, as they called it — one of the dumbest deals ever made.
As an example, why didn’t they take care of Yemen in the deal?
Why didn’t they take care of Syria in the deal?
You know what Kerry said — the reason?
“It was too complicated.”

We’re giving $150 billion, we paid $1.8 billion in cash — cash.
This whole room would be filled up with hundred-dollar bills.
And you’d need probably five rooms like this.
But you have $1.8 billion in cash.
Why didn’t we take care of Yemen?
Why didn’t we take care of Syria and other?
And he said, “Because it was too complicated.”  Well, you just gave all your cards.
You gave them $150 billion.
And now Yemen’s a mess, but it’s getting better.
And Syria’s a mess.
And I was responsible — and I hope it stays that way — when I put out on social media, a few weeks ago, about Idlib Province.
I said, “Don’t do it.”  And I’ll tell you, it happened — where I was at a meeting with a lot of supporters, and a woman stood up and she said, “There’s a province in Syria with 3 million people.
Right now, the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province.
And they’re going to kill my sister.
And they’re going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs.”  But I think we can call them terrorists.
And I said, “That’s not going to happen.”  I didn’t hear of Idlib Province.
And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times — I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times.
And I opened it up — not on the front page, but there was a very big story.
I said, “Wow, that’s the same story that the woman told me that I found hard to believe.”  Because why would — how would anyone do that with 3 million people?
And it said that they were being surrounded, and they were going in and starting — literally, the next day, they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35,000 terrorists.
And I put out on social media and elsewhere — I gave Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, everybody these orders: “Don’t let it happen.”  I said, “Don’t let it happen.”  That doesn’t mean they can’t be selective.
They can’t be — you know, go in and they’ve got to do what they’ve got to do with terrorists.
I assume they’re terrorists.
But don’t kill millions of people.
And it stopped.
You saw that.
Nobody’s going to give me credit, but that’s okay.
That’s okay.
Because the people the people know.
I have had more Syrians thank me for that.
This was about four weeks ago, I put that out.
I said, “They’re surrounding a city of 3 million people.
They’re going to start bombing the city.
Don’t let it happen.”  And I meant it, too.
I meant it.
And millions of people have been saved.
And I gave, today, great credit to Iran.
I don’t know if you heard that.
I gave great credit to Iran, to Russia, and to Syria for not doing it.
Now I hope it’s going to be surgical — meaning go in and do — it’s lengthy and everything else.
And they possibly have to do it.
But I think millions of people would have been killed.
And that would have been a shame.
And hopefully — and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help.
Turkey has been great.
Turkey has helped us very much with that whole situation.
Q    Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
Yes.
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
Thank you very much.
Q    Touching back on Iran: Of course, this week, you put out a call to action to other countries to rally with America, to put pressure on Iran.
Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal.
But after meeting with world leaders this week, did you make any progress towards a potential new deal?
THE PRESIDENT:  Doesn’t matter what world leaders think on Iran.
Iran’s going to come back to me and they’re going to make a good deal, I think.
Maybe not.
Deals — you never know.
But they’re suffering greatly.
They’re having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama.
Far greater.
When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people.
You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that.
But I’m sticking up for the people.
I am with the people of Iran.
But here’s the thing:  They have rampant inflation.
Their money is worthless.
Everything is going wrong.
They have riots in the street.
You can’t buy bread.
You can’t do anything.
It’s a disaster.
At some point, I think they’re going to want to come back, and they’re going to say, “Hey, can we do something?”

And I’m very simple; I just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.
That’s all.
Is that too much to ask?
I don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.
I want them to have a great economy.
I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices — I’m not happy with OPEC.
I told them, “I’m not happy with OPEC.”  We take care of all these people, we defend them.
They wouldn’t be there for two weeks if it wasn’t for me, and the United States, and a much stronger armed forces than it was.
Because our armed forces was depleted.
We had old equipment.
Now, we have — hey, you know better than anybody — $700 billion and $716 billion.
We have the most incredible new jets and everything.
We need it.
Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs.
It’s all made in the United States.
But Iran has to come back, and they have to talk.
And I’m not doing this from strength or weakness.
I’m just saying, at some point, I think they’re going to have to come back.
If you look at what’s going on, companies are leaving left and right.
Mercedes Benz just left.
They’re all leaving.
They don’t want to be in Iran.
Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?
And we have, by — we picked up $10 trillion since my election.
We were being caught by China.
Now it’s going the other way.
People can’t believe it.
People have never seen this situation with China.
Everything’s always been — for 20 years, “Oh, China is so great.
China is so great.”  You don’t hear that so much anymore.
I love China; I think they’re great.
But you don’t hear that so much anymore.
You know who’s great now?
We’re great now.
Okay, how about just a couple more.
Now, I could be doing — I could be doing this all day long.
I could be doing this all day long.
Should we continue for a little while?
It doesn’t matter to me.
A couple of more.
I don’t care.
New York Times, come on.
New York Times.
The failing New York Times.
Stand up.
Go ahead.
Q    You’re talking about me, but (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m talking about the Times is failing.
You are far from failing.
Go ahead.
Q    Okay, but you’re not — you were pointing to me, so you meant me.
But I —

THE PRESIDENT:  The Times are very interesting, though.
The Times, I think they’re going to endorse me.
(Laughter.)
I think that ABC — I think — well, Fox — I like Fox.
I really do.
Q    Just to be sure —

THE PRESIDENT:  But I think ABC, CBS, NBC, the Times, the — they’re all going to endorse me, because if they don’t, they’re going out of business.
Can you imagine if you didn’t have me?
Go ahead, what would you like to say?
Q    Just to be sure, I know you were pointing to me, but I work for PBS NewsHour.
THE PRESIDENT:  I know that.
No, I know that.
Q    (Laughs.)
Okay.
So, I want to ask you: Yesterday, you were talking about your administration’s accomplishments at the United Nations, and a lot of the leaders laughed.
Why do you think they were laughing?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s fake news.
Q    And what was that experience like for you?
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.
It was fake news.
And it was covered that way.
Okay.
So, I said that, since my election, our economy has become the hottest in the world.
Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years — really, soon to be historic.
Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country.
You look at Black unemployment.
You look at Asian unemployment.
You look at women — 65 years.
The unemployment numbers are among the best we’ve ever had ever.
The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.
And I said this.
And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations — people that aren’t big into clapping, applauding, smiling.
And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before.
It’s true.
I mean, it is true.
And I heard a little rustle.
And I said, “It’s true.”  And I heard smiles.
And I said, “Oh, I didn’t know there there’d be that kind…”  They weren’t laughing at me.
They were laughing with me.
We had fun.
That was not laughing at me.
So the fake news said, “People laughed at President Trump.”  They didn’t laugh at me.
People had a good time with me.
We were doing it together.
We had a good time.
They respect what I’ve done.
The United States is respected again.
The United States was not respected.
Everybody was taking advantage of us.
From jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price — to so many other things, even military protection.
I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said, “Listen, you’re a very rich country.
We protect you.
Without our protection, you would have real problems.
You would have real problems.”

Q    And I — I want to —

THE PRESIDENT:  I said, “You should reimburse us for this protection.
Why are we protecting you?”  And do you want to know what they said after about two minutes of talking?
They agreed with me.
And you can ask this group of very talented people — they agreed with me.
But they said — one of them said, “But Mr. President, nobody ever asked us for that.
They never asked us for that.”  Nobody has ever said, “You should pay.”  These are really wealthy countries.
I mean, I’ll be honest, I just asked Japan.
I said, “We’re defending you.
You’re a very wealthy country.
You’re sending us millions of cars.
You’re making a fortune.
We have a tremendous trade deficit with you.
And we’re defending you, and we’re subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money.”

I said it to South Korea.
We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea.
They’re a very wealthy — these are great countries.
These are very wealthy countries.
I said, “Why aren’t you reimbursing us for our costs?”

And you know what?
They look at me, and they can’t even answer it, because there’s no answer.
If they’re a poor country and they needed protection, and people were going to die, I’m all for protecting them; I don’t want 10 cents.
But when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us — massive — and then on top of that, we’re paying for their military?
Or we’re paying for a lot of their military?
That doesn’t work.
How about two more, and we’ll call it?
Q    Mr. President, really quickly.
Mr. President, you said you feel a kinship — you said you feel a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh and you — Mr. President, really quickly, you said you felt a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh.
You said that you also — your false allegations that you feel like were made against you make you feel like you don’t want to believe these women.
What message do you think that —

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t say that.
Why do you say that?
Q    So, please explain —

THE PRESIDENT:  Fake news.
Q    Please explain —

THE PRESIDENT:  Why — did I say that?
Q    Well, can you please explain then what you’re talking about in your own false allegations?
THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.
And by the way, I think you do a very good job, but I didn’t say that.
I do watch you.
And I think you do a very good job.
But I didn’t say that.
Q    So could you explain what you meant?
THE PRESIDENT:  I said, exactly, “I look forward to watching her.”  I do want to hear what she says.
And maybe she’ll say — I could be convinced of anything.
Maybe, if she’ll say something — but in the meantime, I have to tell you, he’s one of the highest quality human beings.
He’s a tremendous man.
He’s a tremendous genius.
He’s a great intellect.
He was, I believe, number one at Yale.
Is that a correct statement?
Number one in his class at Yale.
Q    So you don’t feel a kinship with him?
THE PRESIDENT:  He was a great student in law.
He was — you know, I’ve heard his name.
I didn’t know him.
Didn’t know him.
Until this whole thing, I didn’t know him.
But I heard his name for 10 years.
And you know how I heard his name?
Everybody was saying he should be on the Supreme Court.
I said, “Who is he?”  “His name is Brett Kavanaugh.
And he should be — he’s the most brilliant person.
He’s the most brilliant lawyer.”  They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago.
With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say.
Okay?
Q    But you said that you don’t feel — but you said that you feel like there have been numerous false allegations against you, and that because of that–

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I’ve had many false —

Q    — you feel that you understand what he might be going through.
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve had many false statements against me.
And if the press would have reported it, I would have been very happy.
I think John Roberts would tell you that — you covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me.
Sean Hannity covered it.
I will tell you, when I saw that on Sean Hannity, I actually called him.
Believe it or not, I don’t speak to him very much, but I respect him.
I called him.
I said, “This is the biggest story.
This is a big, big story.”  He agreed with me.
The next day, I picked up the papers.
There wasn’t one word about it.
The next day, I watched ABC news.
John, I watched NBC.
I watched CBS.
I didn’t watch CNN, but, next time, I’m going to.
(Laughter.)
Q    And are you okay with —

THE PRESIDENT:  I watched everything.
There wasn’t one story other than Fox.
And it’s a big story.
It’s a shame.
Okay.
Enough.
Thank you, though.
Q    And is it okay if I give it to the New York Times?
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Thank you.
Q    Is it okay if I give it to the New York Times, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
That’s enough, please.
Q    I’m just going to — okay.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good job.
Good job.
Q    Mr. President, could I ask a question, since I am from the New York Times —

Q    Mr. President —

Q    — before this gentleman?
THE PRESIDENT:  Since you’re where?
Since you’re where?
Q    I’m actually from the New York Times.
Yamiche is my former colleague, and we miss her.
But I was hoping I could ask a question.
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t blame you.
But I’ll let you do it after he does it.
Is that okay?
Q    That’s perfectly well.
THE PRESIDENT:  I will do that in honor of a paper I once loved.
(Laughter.)
Q    Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    Mr. President, my name is Edward Szall, with TruNews.
Today, you met with Bibi Netanyahu, from Israel.
And you brought up, actually, that you support a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis there.
THE PRESIDENT:  I do.
Q    Can you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal (inaudible) —

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’d love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians.
You know, my whole life, I was told that’s the toughest deal.
And I disagree.
I think healthcare is probably tougher, okay?
You want to know the truth.
But it is tough.
But we’re going to take care of that, too.
And that’s going to get taken care of.
We’ve already taken care of a lot of it.
But the whole — my life, I’ve always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, that’s like the toughest deal.
Every possible thing is tough about that.
I think we’re going to make a deal.
I think we’re going to make a deal.
So, at one of our many meetings today, I was with Bibi Netanyahu, a man who I have a lot of respect for.
A man who has been extremely nice to me — very happy that I did the whole thing with Jerusalem and the embassy, which, by the way, we’re going to open in four months for less than $500,000.
And the budget was over $1 billion, right?
Q    Yes.
That’s correct.
THE PRESIDENT:  So we saved, let’s say, a billion dollars.
That’s not so bad.
And it’s open.
And it’s beautiful, by the way.
Jerusalem stone, one of my favorite stones.
I will tell you, the question — somebody said today, “Well, this is the first news conference in a long time.”  I said, “What do you mean?
I did like, five today.”  Every time I sit, I take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room — meaning, reporters.
And one of the reporters — I won’t say that it was John Roberts that said that, I refuse.
But one of the — it was, but that’s okay.
Don’t feel guilty, John.
But of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one-state, two-state.
And I said, “I think the two-state will happen.
I think it’s, in one way, more difficult because it’s a real estate deal — because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything.
It’s actually a little tougher deal.
But in another way, it works better because you have people governing themselves.
So, they asked be about that.
I said, “Well, I think the two-state will happen.
I think we’re going to go down the two-state road.”  And I’m glad I got it out.
And Jared, who is so involved — he loves Israel.
He loves Israel.
But he’s also going to be very fair with the Palestinians.
He understands it takes two people to be happy — two groups of people to be happy.
Everybody has got to be happy.
And that’s why it’s so tough, because there’s been so much hatred and anger for so many years.
That’s what, probably, the number-one ingredient of toughness is.
But they asked me — I said I think it’s going to be a two-state.
And you know what I did today?
By saying that, I put it out there.
And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that.
But nobody wanted to say it.
It’s a big thing to put it out.
It’s a very big thing to put it out.
Now, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that’s okay with me.
If they want two states, that’s okay with me.
I’m happy if they’re happy.
I’m a facilitator.
I want to see if I can get a deal done so that people don’t get killed anymore.
When we had — in Saudi Arabia, we had one of the great conferences in history.
Many of you were there; probably all of you were there.
It was one of the most beautiful two days.
That, and China — two of the most incredible events I’ve ever seen.
I’ve never seen anything like it.
And we had, I believe, 58 Muslim countries — the leaders.
The kings, the emirs, the absolute leaders from every — there was nobody in second place.
They were the leaders of the whole thing.
And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually — it wasn’t a setup.
They’d come up to me and say, “Sir, you can’t have peace in the Middle East without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.”  I said, “Why?
What difference?
Why does that matter so much?”  They said, “It just is impossible to make peace in the Middle East unless you have between the Israelis…”

So, I heard that from one — the King of Saudi Arabia, who is a great guy — King Salman.
And then, somebody else came up.
And he wasn’t told, “Oh, go up and say it.”  I know where they’re coming from.
And I must have had 12 leaders say it.
And they just said it.
And I started to realize that peace between Israel and the Palestinians, for the Middle East, is a very important thing.
And we’re trying very hard to get it.
I think, probably, two-state is more likely.
But you know what?
If they do a single, if they do a double, I’m okay with it if they’re both happy.
If they’re both happy, I’m okay with either.
I think the two-state is more likely.
Okay, how about one — go ahead.
Q    New York Times?
New York Times?
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, okay.
Q    Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  I would have gotten bad story in the New York Times.
But I will anyways, so I guess it doesn’t matter.
Q    We’re — we’re kind of, uh —

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, we’ll do you after that.
Q    We’re kind of, uh —

THE PRESIDENT:  And then we’ll call it quits.
Q    We’re kind of thriving, not failing these days.
THE PRESIDENT:  You’re doing very well.
Q    Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  Say, “Thank you, Mr. Trump.”  (Laughter.)
Q    (Laughs).
I think I’ll stop short of that.
(Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  I wonder how you do — you know, all my life, I’ve had very few stories — but I’ve had some on the front page of the New York Times.
Now, I think I think I average about three or four a day, right?
Q    That is —

THE PRESIDENT:  And, of the three or four, they’re all negative.
No matter what I do, they’re negative.
But you know what?
That’s okay.
I still love the paper.
Go ahead.
(Laughter.)
Q    I wanted to come back to China, because I think what you announced today was really important.
THE PRESIDENT:  I agree.
Q    You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his government —

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.
Q    — of interfering in our internal affairs —

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.
Q    — subverting our Democratic process, and doing it to hurt you, the Republican Party —

THE PRESIDENT:  Doing it to help them.
Q    — and your backers.
THE PRESIDENT:  You know what?
Yeah.
Doing it to help them.
Q    So how can a guy who does that be your friend?
THE PRESIDENT:  I think that we are able to — and maybe he’s not anymore.
I’ll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship.
I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other.
They are doing studies on Donald Trump.
They’re trying to figure it all out because this has never happened to them before.
It’s never happened.
Think of it, you’ve never seen — you’ve covered very well — you’ve never seen this happen.
They’re having big problems.
I don’t want them to have problems, but they got to make a fair deal.
Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.
I believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together.
And I can tell you that about many leaders.
I can also tell you a few where I don’t feel I’ll ever have a chemistry with them.
I don’t want to have a chemistry with them.
And for those people, I’ll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared.
I can go — our general; I’ll have our general.
Or if they can’t do it, I’ll have Sarah Huckabee do it.
Right?
But for the most part, I have very good — very good with Prime Minister Abe.
Very good with President Moon.
By the way, what President Moon said last night — I know you won’t report it — but Bret Baier interviewed him last night and he asked him about me.
I can’t say — because you would say I’m too braggadocios — but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing.
“Couldn’t have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump.
And nobody else could do it.”  You know, I mean, you’ll take a look.
But I will tell you, China is very special.
Very special.
They’re incredible people.
It’s an incredible country.
What they’ve done is unbelievable.
Q    How would —

THE PRESIDENT:  And it all started with the WTO.
It was a defective deal.
And it all started — without the WTO, China is not China as we know it today.
And then it started also by — our people that are standing right in this position, that are in the Oval Office — another way of saying it — allowed them to get away with murder.
Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.
I think we still probably have a very good relationship.
But you know what?
In honor of you, I will, tomorrow, make a call to him.
Say, “Hey, how you doing?”  Okay?
Q    Can I — can I just ask —

THE PRESIDENT:  “You don’t mind paying billions of dollars a month in tariffs.”

Q    I just had two small follow-ups.
One is, how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the Chinese to what Russia did in 2016?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s different.
If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials.
Saying about, “Oh, you got to stop Trump.
You got to stop him.
You got to vote against him.”  My farmers are so incredible.
These are patriots.
You know, on a network that doesn’t like me very much — which is most of them — but a network that didn’t — doesn’t really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers.
And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden China stops buying.
By the way, they’ve started buying again.
I don’t know if you’ve noticed.
And soybeans are going up, and things are going up.
And we’ve had very little hurt from what I’ve done.
In fact, the markets have gone up.
And the farmers are going to do great.
But, ultimately — but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them.
And they voted for me and they love me.
And they said, “We don’t care if we get hurt.
He’s doing the right thing.”  And, you know, a lot of people — it’s a complex game.
A lot of people don’t know exactly what it is.
They don’t know how to define “tariff.”  They don’t know it is really different than a tax, although it’s getting close.
But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that’s fighting for them; that’s not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that’s not allowing the kind of abuse that we — I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA.
And for years — because it was never changed — NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.
You know why?
Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that.
And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it.
So you went many years and they never changed it.
There was a VAT tax that Mexico got.
So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started.
NAFTA was a horrible thing.
So the farmers and — by the way, the steel workers — you know, I stopped the dumping.
The dumping was horrible.
And now if they want to dump, that’s okay, but they’ve got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump.
That’s okay.
But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.
But the farmers say, “This man is fighting for us.
No President has ever fought for us before.”  And you really have to study what’s happened over the 15 years with the farm.
The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period.
They’ve been decimated.
The farmers are going to come out great.
These are great people.
They’re great, great patriots.
I think we should finish with that one.
Is that okay?
(Cross-talk.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.
Go ahead.
Let’s go.
Fast.
Q    Sure.
THE PRESIDENT:  I always like — always like to finish with a good one.
Elton John said, “When you hit that last tune and it’s good, don’t go back.”  (Laughter.)
I’ve seen — have you ever seen?
They do great.
They’re great.
They hit the last tune and everyone goes crazy.
Then they go back for an encore, right?
And they don’t hit it.
And they leave — everyone leaves.
They said, “That wasn’t a very good concert, was it?”

Let’s go.
Q    Well, I’ll ask you one final question —

THE PRESIDENT:  You — don’t make me wrong.
Go ahead.
Q    — ahead of tomorrow’s hearing.
Because you were asked earlier in the news conference about Brett —

THE PRESIDENT:  Say it again.
Say it again.
Q    About the hearing tomorrow.
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
Q    You were asked earlier in the news conference by my friend from Sky News about the message that you are sending to —

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
Q    — the women of the country.
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.
Q    What about the message that you may be sending to young men?
You’re a father.
What does this moment that we’re in — the cultural moment —

THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a very big cultural moment.
Q    Right.
So what messages do you for young men of America?
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a very big — it’s also — you’re right.
I think it’s a great question.
This is a very big moment for our country because you have a man who is very outstanding, but he’s got very strong charges against him — probably charges that nobody is going to be able be — to prove.
So I could have you chosen for a position.
I could have you, or you, or you — anybody.
And somebody could say things.
And it’s happened to me many times, where false statements are made.
And honestly, nobody knows who to believe.
I could pick another Supreme Court judge — Justice.
I could pick another one.
Another one.
Another one.
This could go on forever.
Somebody could come and say, “Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me.
He did this.
He did that.
He did that.”

And honestly, it’s a very dangerous period in our country.
And it’s being perpetrated by some very evil people.
Some of them are Democrats, I must say.
Because some of them know that this is just a game that they’re playing.
It’s a con game.
It’s at the highest level.
We’re talking about the United States Supreme Court.
This can go on forever.
I can pick five other people.
At a certain point, the people are going to say, “No, thank you.”  This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.
And you know what?
I would honestly say — because I interviewed great people for this job.
He’s great, but I interviewed other great people for this job.
I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying, “It’s too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I’m going to choose you, number two.
I want you to go.”  And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job two months ago.
Q    With respect, sir —

THE PRESIDENT:  So this is — this is — and this is beyond Supreme Court.
Q    Right.
THE PRESIDENT:  There’s nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court.
This has everything to do with our country.
When you are guilty until proven innocent, it’s just not supposed to be that way.
Always I heard, “You’re innocent until proven guilty.”  I’ve heard this for so long, and it’s such a beautiful phrase.
In this case, you’re guilty until proven innocent.
I think that is a very, very dangerous standard for our country.
With that being said, I look forward to what she has to say.
I also look very forward to what Judge Kavanaugh has to say.
I think it’s going to be a very, very important day in the history of our country.
Q    And —

THE PRESIDENT:  I want to thank you all.
We’ll do it again.
Q    Sir, the message to young men?
Sir?
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
SPEECH 11: Remarks by President Trump at Tax Reform Event - Sept. 5, 2017

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
Thank you very much.
It’s so nice.
And we appreciate it.
And all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, we appreciate it very much.
I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — (applause) — and all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today.
Where is Jerry?
Where is Jerry?
(Applause.)
Thank you.
Thank you, Jerry.
What a job.
I’ve heard so much about you.
It’s a great honor to know you, Jerry.
Thank you.
I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.
(Applause.)
Thank you, Steve.
Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross.
(Applause.)
Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, is a very large business, I will tell you that — Linda McMahon, a friend of mine.
(Applause.)
And from the purely political world, a really great friend who did such an incredible job with his beautiful wife at the inauguration, Senator Roy Blunt.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Applause.)
Where’s Roy?
Thank you, Roy.
Governor Greitens is here, who is doing some job.
(Applause.)
Thank you, Governor.
Special.
Lieutenant Governor Parson.
Lieutenant Governor, thank you, Lieutenant Governor.
And our great members of Commerce [Congress], I want to thank you all for coming.
There are so many.
I was asking the Governor and Roy, I said, do you think I should announce them all?
I have so many.
But I’m honored that they’re here.
Representative Sam Graves.
(Applause.)
Representative Vicky Hartzler, who has been terrific.
(Applause.)
My friend for a long time, and just somebody that he liked me from the beginning and I liked him, Billy Long.
Where’s Billy?
(Applause.)
Billy.
Right, Billy?
Right from the beginning.
Blaine Luetkemeyer — where’s Blaine?
Good.
Thank you, Blaine.
(Applause.)
Representative Jason Smith.
(Applause.)
Jason, thank you for everything, Jason.
Representative Ann Wagner.
Hi, Ann.
Good job, Ann.
(Applause.)
And, I don’t know, we have so many more.
Anybody I forgot?
Right?
Everything okay?
Good, I got it.
You, I remember more than anybody.
Thank you all very much.
I appreciate it.
And to the congressmen and congresswomen, we very much appreciate you all being here.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
Before we begin, I’d like to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana.
As we all know, our Gulf Coast was hit over the weekend with a devastating hurricane of historic proportion.
Torrential rains and terrible flooding continue to pose a grave danger to life and to property.
Our first responders have been doing absolutely heroic work to shepherd people out of harm’s way, and their courage and devotion has saved countless lives.
They represent truly the very best of America.
(Applause.)
We must be vigilant.
We must protect the lives of our people.
I was on the ground in Texas yesterday to meet with Governor Abbott — who is doing, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.
We see friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger.
And together, we will endure and we will overcome.
(Applause.)
To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are here with you every single step of the way.
And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room — every step of the way.
(Applause.)
To those Americans who have lost loved ones: All of America is grieving with you, and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
The citizens of Texas and the Gulf Coast need all the prayers, support, and resources our communities have to offer.
Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild.
As our thoughts and prayers remain firmly with the citizens and our fellow people — people — great, great people — all affected by this tragedy.
We’re also glad to be back in the heartland with the very, very fine folks of Missouri.
(Applause.)
And I said to Senator Blunt and I said to Billy Long on the plane coming in — can I say “Missouri,” or should I say “Missouruh”?
Okay?
And they said, whatever you want is okay.
So I said, good.
But I’m especially pleased to be here in Springfield, the birthplace of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Who would have known that?
(Applause.)
This is the place where the “Main Street of America” got its start, and this is where America’s main street will begin its big, beautiful comeback that — you are seeing it right now.
This is a comeback of historic proportions.
You’re seeing it happen right now.
(Applause.)
Right?
You’re seeing it.
We’re here today to launch our plans to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers.
(Applause.)
Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
And you have seen what’s happening with regulations — they’re going fast.
We need regulations, but many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.
(Applause.)
That is why the foundation of our job creation agenda is to fundamentally reform our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years.
I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American.
(Applause.)
There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
(Applause.)
And, by the way, before I start, Ivanka Trump — I see my beautiful daughter is in the audience.
Stand up, honey.
(Applause.)
She’s working very hard.
I’m very proud of Ivanka.
For many decades, Route 66 captured the American spirit.
The communities along this historic route were a vivid symbol of America’s booming industry.
Truck drivers hauled made-in-America goods along this vital artery of commerce.
Families passed through bustling towns on their way to explore the great American West.
And high-quality manufacturing jobs lifted up communities, gave Americans a paycheck that could support a family.
Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that do it.
(Applause.)
Stand up.
Stand up Mr. Cook.
Stand up.
(Applause.)
I think they like you.
And provided millions of our fellow citizens with the pride and dignity that comes with work.
But, in recent years, millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.
And it wasn’t pleasant to watch, especially for me.
I would sit back — I was in business — and I could see what was happening.
It wasn’t good.
If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.
(Applause.)
In the last 10 years, our economy has grown at only around two percent a year.
If you look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they’re unhappy when it’s seven, eight, nine.
And I speak to them — leaders of the countries — how are you doing?
“Not well, not well.” Why?
“GDP is down to seven percent.” And I’m saying, we were hitting one percent just a number of months ago.
So we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you.
And we’re going change it around fast.
(Applause.)
And today — a very appropriate day that this should happen — we just announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
It just came out.
(Applause.)
And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit three percent.
So we’re really on our way.
If we achieve sustained three percent growth, that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion dollars of new economic activity over the next decade.
That’s some numbers.
(Applause.)
And I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.
There’s no reason why we shouldn’t.
(Applause.)
So this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.
And I don’t want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me?
Do you understand?
(Applause.)
Congress — I think Congress is going to make a comeback.
I hope so.
(Laughter.)
I tell you what, the United States is counting on it.
(Applause.)
Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.
(Applause.)
That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests.
Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago.
It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax breaks, reduced the number of tax brackets from fifteen to two, and lowered tax rates for both individuals and businesses.
At the time, it was really something special.
Since then, our tax laws have tripled in size, and the tax code itself now spans more than 2,600 pages, and most of it is not understandable.
Tax rates have increased, and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.
The tax code is now a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans.
In 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instructions.
Today, that basic form has one hundred pages of instructions, and it’s pretty complex stuff.
The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes.
This enormous complexity is very unfair.
It disadvantages ordinary Americans who don’t have an army of accountants while benefitting deep-pocketed special interests.
And most importantly, this is wrong.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
First and foremost, our tax system should benefit loyal, hardworking Americans and their families.
(Applause.)
That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes — and I’m speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you.
And I might be speaking against Mr. Cook, and we’re both okay with it, is that right?
It’s crazy.
We’re speaking — maybe we shouldn’t be doing this, you know?
(Laughter.)
But we’re doing the right thing.
(Applause.)
True.
And allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant.
Second, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.
It’s time to give American workers the pay raise that they’ve been looking for for many, many years.
(Applause.)
In 1986, Ronald Reagan led the world by cutting our corporate tax rate to 34 percent.
That was below the average rate for developed countries at the time.
Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened.
But then, under this pro-America system, our economy boomed.
It just went beautifully — right through the roof.
The middle class thrived and median family income increased.
Other countries saw the success.
They looked at us.
They saw — what is America doing?
What’s happening with the United States?
And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
Over the past 30 years, the average business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.
And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, China and some others that are highly competitive, and really doing very well against us.
They are taking us, frankly, to the cleaners.
So we must — we have no choice — we must lower our taxes.
And your Senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you.
And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office.
(Applause.)
She’s got to make that commitment.
She’s got to make that commitment.
If she doesn’t do it, you just can’t do this anymore, with the obstruction and the obstructionists.
If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — we are looking for the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.
But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should.
The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.
Not one vote.
We got not one vote to try and fix healthcare and get rid of Obamacare.
The strategy of our economic rivals has worked.
They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country.
Large corporations changed their business models by exporting jobs to other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, where they’d make massive profits, and they wouldn’t be paying tax to us either.
So we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories.
We got nothing but unemployment.
We got nothing.
Other businesses — even classic American brands — switched their headquarters to foreign countries.
Because of this and other reasons, like weak borders, America remains stuck in the past.
Although I have to tell you, we have General Kelly here today, and we stopped 78 percent — going up to 80 percent — on the border traffic coming through, in just a short period of time.
(Applause.)
He has done some job.
A whole different world out there right now.
Today, we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
And think of it: In some cases, way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes, in various states.
The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and many other nations.
Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive trade deficits — numbers that you would not believe.
But this administration is going to fix that.
One by one, we’re fixing it.
We’re working right now on NAFTA — the horrible, terrible NAFTA deal that took so much business out of your state and out of your cities and towns, and we’re working on it.
Let’s see what happens.
(Applause.)
Mexico is not happy.
(Laughter.)
But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of years and everybody left you alone.
We got to change this deal.
And hopefully we can renegotiate it.
But if we can’t, we’ll terminate it and we’ll start all over again with a real deal.
(Applause.)
So when it comes to the business tax, we are dead last.
Can you believe that?
So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer.
America must lead the way, not follow from behind.
We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher.
We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries.
We have totally surrendered.
We’re not surrendering anymore.
(Applause.)
Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries, but still, by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world.
But it would make us highly competitive.
In other words, foreign companies have more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
They can pay their workers more, sell their products and services at lower cost, and still make more money than their U.S. competitors.
We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage.
We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America — the America we love.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Because when businesses compete for labor, your wages will go up.
Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in the USA.
(Applause.)
When I was growing up, I always used to see the signs, and it was always stamped on the product: Made in the USA.
You don’t see it anymore.
We’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA.” (Applause.)
The third principle for tax reform is a crucial one: tax relief for middle-class families.
(Applause.)
In a way — and I’ve been saying this for a long time — they’ve been sort of the forgotten people, but they’re not forgotten any longer.
I can tell you that.
(Applause.)
We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and they can do lots of things with those paychecks.
And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.
And it will be a beautiful thing to watch.
This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of raising a family.
That’s so important to Ivanka Trump.
(Applause.)
Very, very important to everybody in this room, but so important to my daughter.
It’s one of her real big beliefs.
And she’s very committed to that.
Right, Ivanka?
We believe that ordinary Americans know better than Washington how to spend their own money, and we want to help them take home as much of their money as possible and then spend it.
(Applause.)
So they’ll keep their money.
They’ll spend their money.
They’ll buy our product.
Our factories will be moving again.
Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country is going to be just like it says on that beautiful red hat — it says: Make America Great Again.
That’s what we’re going to do.
(Applause.)
Right?
Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home.
So they leave the money over there.
The amount of money we’re talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion.
Can you believe that?
By making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money, and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult, we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
It’s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our communities, and to hire our great American workers.
(Applause.)
My administration is embracing a new economic model.
It’s called very simply: The American Model.
Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
That is how we will all succeed and grow together, as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious American destiny.
(Applause.)
So today I’m calling on all members of Congress — Democrat, Republican and independent — to support pro-American tax reform.
They have to do it.
It’s time.
(Applause.)
They have to do it.
It is time.
I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for our workers and our companies, to attract new companies and businesses to our shores, and to put more money into the pockets of everyday, hardworking people and also into the pockets of our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.
(Applause.)
What could possibly be more bipartisan than allowing families to keep more of what they earn and creating an environment for real job and wage growth in the country that we love so much?
(Applause.)
So let’s put — or at least try to put — the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.
(Applause.)
If we do this, if we unite in the name of common sense and the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and we will give America the competitive advantage that it so desperately needs and has been looking for for so long.
It’s time.
(Applause.)
Products made with American hands, American labor, and American grit will once again be delivered throughout the world.
It’s true.
(Applause.)
It’s time.
Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods.
(Applause.)
Our jobs will both stay here in America and come back to America.
We’ll have it both ways.
Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work.
They will love getting up in the morning.
They will love going to their job.
They will love earning a big, fat, beautiful paycheck.
They will be proud again.
(Applause.)
That is the future I want for our people.
That is the future I want for America — a nation where we are proud, prosperous, united, and free.
Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.
I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have many with us today, to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our people.
And if we do these things, and if we care for and support each other, and love each other, then we will truly make America great again.
Thank you.
God bless you.
(Applause.)
God bless you, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Governor, thank you.
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
SPEECH 12: Remarks by President Trump on Infrastructure, Charlottesville - Aug. 15, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.
Great to be back in New York with all of our friends, and some great friends outside the building, I must tell you.
I want to thank all of our distinguished guests who are with us today, including members of our Cabinet:  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and, of course, our Transportation Secretary — who is doing a fabulous job — Elaine Chao.
Thank you all for doing a really incredible and creative job on what we’re going to be discussing today, which is infrastructure.
We’ve just had a great set of briefings upstairs on our infrastructure agenda.
My administration is working every day to deliver the world-class infrastructure that our people deserve and, frankly, that our country deserves.
That’s why I just signed a new executive order to dramatically reform the nation’s badly broken infrastructure permitting process.
Just blocks away is the Empire State Building.
It took 11 months to build the Empire State Building.
But today, it can take as long as a decade and much more than that — many, many stories where it takes 20 and 25 years just to get approvals to start construction of a fairly routine highway.
Highway builders must get up to 16 different approvals involving nine different federal agencies governed by 29 different statutes.
One agency alone can stall a project for many, many years, and even decades.
Not only does this cost our economy billions of dollars, but it also denies our citizens the safe and modern infrastructure they deserve.
This overregulated permitting process is a massive self-inflicted wound on our country — it’s disgraceful — denying our people much-needed investments in their community.
And I just want to show you this because it was just shown to me, and I said, I think I’m going to show it to the media — both real and fake media, by the way.
This is what it takes to get something approved today.
Elaine, you see that?
So this is what it takes.
Permitting process flowchart — that’s a flowchart.
So that can go out to 20 years.
This shows about 10, but that can go out to about 20 years to get something approved.
This is for a highway.
I’ve seen a highway recently in a certain state — I won’t mention its name — 17 years.
I could have built it for four or five million dollars without the permitting process.
It cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but it took 17 years to get it approved and many, many, many, many pages of environmental impact studies.
This is what we will bring it down to.
This is less than two years.
This is going to happen quickly.
That’s what I’m signing today.
This will be less than two years for a highway.
So it’s going to be quick, it’s going to be a very streamlined process.
And, by the way, if it doesn’t meet environmental safeguards, we’re not going to approve it.
Very simple.
We’re not going to approve it.
Maybe this one will say, let’s throw the other one away.
Would anybody like it from the media?
(Laughter.)
Would anybody like that long, beautiful chart?
You can have it.
So my executive order also requires agencies to work together efficiently by requiring one lead agency for each major infrastructure project.
It also holds agencies accountable if they fail to streamline their review process.
So each agency is accountable.
We’re going to get infrastructure built quickly, inexpensively — relatively speaking — and the permitting process will go very, very quickly.
No longer will we tolerate one job-killing delay after another.
No longer will we accept a broken system that benefits consultants and lobbyists at the expense of hardworking Americans.
Now, I knew the process very well — probably better than anybody.
I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built — all of the buildings I built in Manhattan and many other places.
And I will tell you that the consultants are rich people.
They go around making it very difficult.
They lobby Congress, they lobby state governments, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants, and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune.
So we’re streamlining the process, and we won’t be having so much of that anymore.
No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay.
While protecting the environment, we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels, and highways.
We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel.
We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true.
Our infrastructure will again be the best in the world.
We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world, and today we’re like a third-world country.
We are literally like a third-world country.
Our infrastructure will again be the best, and we will restore the pride in our communities, our nation, and all over the United States we’ll be proud again.
So I want to thank everybody for being here.
God bless you.
God bless the United States.
And if you have any questions, we have — Mick, you can come up here please.
Come on up.
Mick Mulvaney.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
Q    Mr. President, why do you think these CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council?
THE PRESIDENT:  Because they’re not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country.
And we want jobs, manufacturing in this country.
If you look at some of those people that you’re talking about they’re outside of the country, they’re having a lot of their product made outsider.
If you look at Merck as an example, take a look where — excuse me, excuse me — take a look at where their product is made.
It’s made outside of our country.
We want products made in the country.
Now, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they’re leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside.
And I’ve been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you’re referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country.
You can’t do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places.
You have to bring this work back to this country.
That’s what I want.
I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit.
Q    Let me ask you, Mr. President, why did you wait so long to blast neo-Nazis?
THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t wait long.
Q    You waited two days —

THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t wait long.
Q    Forty-eight hours.
THE PRESIDENT:  I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct — not make a quick statement.
The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.
But you don’t make statements that direct unless you know the facts.
It takes a little while to get the facts.
You still don’t know the facts.
And it’s a very, very important process to me, and it’s a very important statement.
So I don’t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement.
I want to know the facts.
If you go back to —

Q    So you had to (inaudible) white supremacists?
THE PRESIDENT:  I brought it.
I brought it.
I brought it.
Q    Was it terrorism, in your opinion, what happened?
THE PRESIDENT:  As I said on — remember, Saturday — we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.
It has no place in America.
And then it went on from there.
Now, here’s the thing —

Q    (Inaudible) many sides.
THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Take it nice and easy.
Here’s the thing:  When I make a statement, I like to be correct.
I want the facts.
This event just happened.
In fact, a lot of the event didn’t even happen yet, as we were speaking.
This event just happened.
Before I make a statement, I need the facts.
So I don’t want to rush into a statement.
So making the statement when I made it was excellent.
In fact, the young woman, who I hear was a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC — her mother wrote me and said through, I guess, Twitter, social media, the nicest things.
And I very much appreciated that.
I hear she was a fine — really, actually, an incredible young woman.
But her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said.
And honestly, if the press were not fake, and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice.
But unlike you, and unlike — excuse me, unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.
Q    Why do Nazis like you — (inaudible) — these statements?
THE PRESIDENT:  They don’t.
They don’t.
Q    They do.
Look —

(Cross-talk.)
THE PRESIDENT:  How about a couple of infrastructure questions.
Q    Was it terrorism, that event?
Was that terrorism?
Q    The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity —

THE PRESIDENT:  Say it.
What?
Q    The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together.
Did you?
THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.
I think the country — look, you take a look.
I’ve created over a million jobs since I’m President.
The country is booming.
The stock market is setting records.
We have the highest employment numbers we’ve ever had in the history of our country.
We’re doing record business.
We have the highest levels of enthusiasm.
So the head of Walmart, who I know — who’s a very nice guy — was making a political statement.
I mean —

Q    (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  I’d do it the same way.
And you know why?
Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement, that the statement is correct.
And there was no way — there was no way of making a correct statement that early.
I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters.
Unlike a lot of reporters —

Q    Nazis were there.
Q    David Duke was there.
THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t know David Duke was there.
I wanted to see the facts.
And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well stated.
In fact, everybody said, “His statement was beautiful.
If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good.”  I couldn’t have made it sooner because I didn’t know all of the facts.
Frankly, people still don’t know all of the facts.
It was very important — excuse me, excuse me — it was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly.
Because if I would have made a fast statement — and the first statement was made without knowing much, other than what we were seeing.
The second statement was made after, with knowledge, with great knowledge.
There are still things — excuse me — there are still things that people don’t know.
I want to make a statement with knowledge.
I wanted to know the facts.
Q    Two questions.
Was this terrorism?
And can you tell us how you’re feeling about your chief strategist, Stephen Bannon?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family, and this country.
And that is — you can call it terrorism.
You can call it murder.
You can call it whatever you want.
I would just call it as “the fastest one to come up with a good verdict.”  That’s what I’d call it.
Because there is a question:  Is it murder?
Is it terrorism?
And then you get into legal semantics.
The driver of the car is a murderer.
And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.
Q    Can you tell us how you’re feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon?
Can you talk about that?
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    I would echo Maggie’s question.
Steve Bannon has come under —

THE PRESIDENT:  I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it.
Q    Can you tell us broadly what your — do you still have confidence in Steve?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see.
Look, look — I like Mr. Bannon.
He’s a friend of mine.
But Mr. Bannon came on very late.
You know that.
I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries.
Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that.
And I like him, he’s a good man.
He is not a racist, I can tell you that.
He’s a good person.
He actually gets very unfair press in that regard.
But we’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.
But he’s a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.
Q    Senator McCain has called on you to defend your National Security Advisor, H.R.
McMaster, against these attacks.
THE PRESIDENT:  I did it the last time.
Q    And he called on it again, linking —

THE PRESIDENT:  Senator McCain?
Q    — to the alt-right, and saying —

THE PRESIDENT:  Senator McCain?
Q    Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  You mean the one who voted against Obamacare?
Q    And he said —

THE PRESIDENT:  Who is — you mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good healthcare?
Q    Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t know.
I can’t tell you.
I’m sure Senator McCain must know what he’s talking about.
But when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me.
You define it.
Go ahead.
Q    Well, I’m saying, as Senator —

THE PRESIDENT:  No, define it for me.
Come on, let’s go.
Define it for me.
Q    Senator McCain defined them as the same group —

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at — excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
Do they have any semblance of guilt?
Let me ask you this:  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
Do they have any problem?
I think they do.
As far as I’m concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.
Q    You’re not putting these —

THE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.
I’m not finished.
I’m not finished, fake news.
That was a horrible day —

Q    Sir, you’re not putting these protestors on the same level as neo-Nazis —

Q    Is the alt-left as bad as white supremacy?
THE PRESIDENT:  I will tell you something.
I watched those very closely — much more closely than you people watched it.
And you have — you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent.
And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now.
You had a group — you had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent.
Q    Is the alt-left as bad as Nazis?
Are they as bad as Nazis?
THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.
Q    Do you think that what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis?
THE PRESIDENT:  Those people — all of those people –excuse me, I’ve condemned neo-Nazis.
I’ve condemned many different groups.
But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.
Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.
Q    Should that statue be taken down?
THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.
If you take a look at some of the groups, and you see — and you’d know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you’re not — but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
So this week it’s Robert E. Lee.
I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down.
I wonder, is it George Washington next week?
And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?
You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?
But they were there to protest — excuse me, if you take a look, the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
Infrastructure question.
Go ahead.
Q    Should the statues of Robert E. Lee stay up?
THE PRESIDENT:  I would say that’s up to a local town, community, or the federal government, depending on where it is located.
Q    How concerned are you about race relations in America?
And do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office?
THE PRESIDENT:  I think they’ve gotten better or the same.
Look, they’ve been frayed for a long time.
And you can ask President Obama about that, because he’d make speeches about it.
But I believe that the fact that I brought in — it will be soon — millions of jobs — you see where companies are moving back into our country — I think that’s going to have a tremendous, positive impact on race relations.
We have companies coming back into our country.
We have two car companies that just announced.
We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announced.
We have many companies, I say, pouring back into the country.
I think that’s going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations.
You know why?
It’s jobs.
What people want now, they want jobs.
They want great jobs with good pay, and when they have that, you watch how race relations will be.
And I’ll tell you, we’re spending a lot of money on the inner cities.
We’re fixing the inner cities.
We’re doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities.
It’s a priority for me, and it’s very important.
Q    Mr. President, are you putting what you’re calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane?
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not putting anybody on a moral plane.
What I’m saying is this:  You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs — and it was vicious and it was horrible.
And it was a horrible thing to watch.
But there is another side.
There was a group on this side.
You can call them the left — you just called them the left — that came violently attacking the other group.
So you can say what you want, but that’s the way it is.
Q    (Inaudible) both sides, sir.
You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides.
Are the —

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think there’s blame on both sides.
If you look at both sides — I think there’s blame on both sides.
And I have no doubt about it, and you don’t have any doubt about it either.
And if you reported it accurately, you would say.
Q    The neo-Nazis started this.
They showed up in Charlottesville to protest —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me.
They didn’t put themselves — and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.
You had people in that group.
Q    (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me.
I saw the same pictures as you did.
You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
Q    George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.
THE PRESIDENT:  George Washington was a slave owner.
Was George Washington a slave owner?
So will George Washington now lose his status?
Are we going to take down —

Excuse me, are we going to take down statues to George Washington?
How about Thomas Jefferson?
What do you think of Thomas Jefferson?
You like him?
Q    I do love Thomas Jefferson.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.
Are we going to take down the statue?
Because he was a major slave owner.
Now, are we going to take down his statue?
So you know what, it’s fine.
You’re changing history.
You’re changing culture.
And you had people — and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists — because they should be condemned totally.
But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.
Okay?
And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people.
But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats.
You had a lot of bad people in the other group.
Q    Who are the good people?
Q    Sir, I just didn’t understand what you were saying.
You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?
I just don’t understand what you were saying.
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.
There were people in that rally — and I looked the night before — if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
I’m sure in that group there were some bad ones.
The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people — neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.
But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest — because I don’t know if you know, they had a permit.
The other group didn’t have a permit.
So I only tell you this:  There are two sides to a story.
I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country — a horrible moment.
But there are two sides to the country.
Does anybody have a final —

Q    I have an infrastructure question.
THE PRESIDENT:  You have an infrastructure —

Q    What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill?
You didn’t get healthcare —

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, I’ll tell you.
We came very close with healthcare.
Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute.
You’ll have to ask John McCain why he did that.
But we came very close to healthcare.
We will end up getting healthcare.
But we’ll get the infrastructure.
And actually, infrastructure is something that I think we’ll have bipartisan support on.
I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure.
Q    Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack?
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’ll be reaching out.
I’ll be reaching out.
Q    When will you be reaching out?
THE PRESIDENT:  I thought that the statement put out — the mother’s statement I thought was a beautiful statement.
I will tell you, it was something that I really appreciated.
I thought it was terrific.
And, really, under the kind of stress that she’s under and the heartache that she’s under, I thought putting out that statement, to me, was really something.
I won’t forget it.
Thank you, all, very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
* * * *

Q    Will you go to Charlottesville?
Will you go to check out what happened?
THE PRESIDENT:  I own a house in Charlottesville.
Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville?
Q    Where is it?
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh boy, it’s going to be —

Q    Where is it?
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s in Charlottesville.
You’ll see.
Q    Is it a winery or something?
THE PRESIDENT:  It is the winery.
I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville.
Charlottesville is a great place that’s been very badly hurt over the last couple of days.
Q    (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT:  I own, actually, one of the largest wineries in the United States.
It’s in Charlottesville.
Q    Do you believe your words are helping to heal this country right now?
Q    What do you think needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think jobs can have a big impact.
I think if we continue to create jobs — over a million, substantially more than a million.
And you see just the other day, the car companies coming in with Foxconn.
I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I’m creating jobs, I think that’s going to have a tremendous impact — positive impact on race relations.
Q    Your remarks today, how do you think that will impact the racial, sort of conflict, today?
THE PRESIDENT:  The people are going to be working, they’re going to be making a lot of money — much more money than they ever thought possible.
But that’s going to happen.
Q    Your remarks today.
THE PRESIDENT:  And the other thing — very important — I believe wages will start going up.
They haven’t gone up for a long time.
I believe wages now — because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up.
I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.
SPEECH 13: President Trump on the Paris Climate Accord - June 1, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.
We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.
But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror.
Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.
Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since Election Day on November 8th.
The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.
We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.
I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
Thank you.
In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.
We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you see that, you see it all over — from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.
Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution.
One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.
And believe me, we’ve just begun.
The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.
On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments.
And I don’t want anything to get in our way.
I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.
Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — (applause) — thank you, thank you — but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
So we’re getting out.
But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.
And if we can, that’s great.
And if we can’t, that’s fine.
(Applause.)
As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.
The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.
Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.
This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.
Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.
This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.
They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.
According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.
The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.
Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.
For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.
They can do whatever they want for 13 years.
Not us.
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
There are many other examples.
But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.
Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.
We’re having a big opening in two weeks.
Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.
A big opening of a brand-new mine.
It’s unheard of.
For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.
They asked me if I’d go.
I’m going to try.
China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.
So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.
India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.
Think of it:  India can double their coal production.
We’re supposed to get rid of ours.
Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.
The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.
A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.
We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.
At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country — (applause) — will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.
Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.
Tiny, tiny amount.
In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.
As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  “The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate.”  The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
We’ll be the cleanest.
We’re going to have the cleanest air.
We’re going to have the cleanest water.
We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.
We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly.
(Applause.)
And I think you just read — it just came out minutes ago, the small business report — small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people.
One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.
(Applause.)
So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.
And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.
And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord.
And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.
But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement.
I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.
No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.
That’s not going to happen while I’m President.
I’m sorry.
(Applause.)
My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.
Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well.
I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
The Republicans are working very, very hard.
We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.
But it’s going very well.
The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.
They don’t put America first.
I do, and I always will.
(Applause.)
The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.
You see what’s happening.
It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.
At what point does America get demeaned?
At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?
We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.
We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.
And they won’t be.
They won’t be.
I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
(Applause.)
I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests.
Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.
Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
The process has begun from day one.
But now we’re down to business.
Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments.
So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.
The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.
That’s where they came.
Believe me, they didn’t come from me.
They came just before I came into office.
Not good.
And not good the way they took the money.
In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as “peanuts,” and stated that “the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.”  In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.
And nobody even knows where the money is going to.
Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?
Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.
America is $20 trillion in debt.
Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.
Millions of our citizens are out of work.
And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
So think of that.
There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.
Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.
Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.
(Applause.)
Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
And I will.
Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.
It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.
The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.
In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point.
And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.
Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.
As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.
The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.
It is time to exit the Paris Accord — (applause) — and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.
It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France.
It is time to make America great again.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Very important.
I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.
SPEECH 14: Remarks by the President at the NRCC Dinner - Mar.
21, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Wow.
You know, I asked how many people would be here tonight.
They said a couple of hundred.
It was just like a little fundraiser.
They didn’t say you broke — 23 years, you broke the all-time record tonight — $30.1 million.
And broke it by $10 million — that’s not so close.
So, congratulations.
We’re going to have a great eight years together.
(Applause.)
And Rasmussen just came out with a very good poll — you’ll be liking this poll.
This poll is good.
We’re going to do a good job.
More importantly, we’re going to do a great job, and then we’re going to win it the old-fashioned way — we’re just going to win it.
And I want to thank everybody.
This is a lot more than 200 people.
This is a hell of a big room.
(Laughter.)
That’s far back.
Can you see over there?
See, I would have gotten rid of these columns, actually.
(Laughter.)
That’s being a construction man.
But that was a long time ago, they didn’t do that.
Well, it’s an honor to address you tonight, and thank each and every one of you for your role in helping to build, sustain and grow a truly strong Republican Party again.
In this effort, we will be working hand-in-hand with our House leadership team — and I’ve really gotten to know them and they are winners and they are terrific people — terrific people.
(Applause.)
Speaker Paul Ryan, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
What a group, great group  (Applause.)
Also with us tonight — a man who I have a lot respect for, gave me a very early endorsement — former Vice President Dick Cheney, along with his daughter, Congressman Liz Cheney.
(Applause.)
Where is he?
Thank you, Dick.
Thank you.
Thank you, Liz.
I also want to thank the Chairman of the Republican Congressional — I mean, look, what a group — Committee.
Where is Steve?
Where is he?
They lost him backstage.
Steve Stivers — where is he?
Steve, what the hell happened?
I think he left.
(Laughter.)
Everyone is looking — it’s the second time he’s been introduced.
Steve, are you there?
Oh.
Come here, Steve.
What a job you did.
Come here, Steve.
He’s embarrassed.
(Laughter.)
Come here, come on, get up here, Steve.
Come here.
(Applause.)
MR. STIVERS:   Thanks, everybody.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s what I like.
See, that’s a real worker.
Oh, boy — no talk, all action, right?
We like people like that.
Congratulations to Steve.
And March Dinner Chairman, Steve Womack, and the NRCC Finance Chair, Ann Wagner — thank you.
Thank you, Ann.
(Applause.)
The work of the NRCC never ends.
In fact, we have four special elections currently underway in Georgia — we won — Montana — we won — Kansas — we won — and South Carolina.
We love South Carolina.
That’s some group.
Where’s South Carolina?
Oh, we love South Carolina.
Remember I was supposed to lose that one big and we won by 21 points.
And that’s when I found out these polls are rigged.
(Laughter.)
They were rigged.
Thank you, South Carolina.
I learned a lot from South Carolina.
Our nominees from Montana and Kansas are here with us this evening — Greg Gianforte and Ron Estes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
On November 8th, the American People voted for historic change — and they also voted for serious action.
By delivering the House, the Senate and the White House, the American people gave us clear instructions:  It’s time to get busy, get to work, and to get the job done.
(Applause.)
That legislative effort begins with Thursday’s crucial vote — and it really is a crucial vote for the Republican Party and for the people of our country — to finally repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
It’s what it is, a disaster.
Premiums have soared double digits and even triple digits.
Insurance companies are fleeing.
One-third of counties only have one Obamacare insurer left.
I was in Tennessee four nights ago — they’ve lost half the state.
The insurance companies are gone and they’re going to lose the next one pretty soon from what they say.
And last night in Kentucky, we had a tremendous crowd — 25,000 people, more — and a similar crowd in Tennessee, by the way — packed, with thousands of people outside.
They couldn’t get them into these massive arenas — there’s something going on that’s really incredible in this country.
It’s really incredible.
But Kentucky also is having a tremendous problem, as you know and as you’ve read, with Obamacare.
And many other states.
The House bill ends the Obamacare nightmare and gives healthcare decisions back to the states — and back to the American people.
These are the conservative solutions we campaigned on, and these are the conservative solutions the American people asked us as a group to deliver.
We are keeping our promises.
I go to these arenas, and they have signs all over the place — He’s kept his promise.
He’s kept his promise.
Because I’ve done a lot of work.
The border is in the best shape it’s been in in decades.
Down 61 percent since inauguration.
(Applause.)
General Kelly — you know, they used to put political people — I refuse to say political hacks because I would not say that.
Because there is no such thing as a political hack.
But they would put nice political people at the border.
I put General Kelly — recommended by General “Mad Dog” Mattis.
(Applause.)
I said to him, General — General Mattis — I said, General, I need somebody really smart and really tough for the border.
Sir, I have the man — General Kelly.
Soon as I saw him it was like — an interview lasted for about 30 seconds — I said, he’s the right guy.
And he’s been great.
And General Mattis has been great — you see what’s going on.
Big difference.
It’s been 60 days since my inauguration, and that was a promise that I’ve really kept.
As you saw today in the Senate, I nominated a Supreme Court justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
(Applause.)
I’ve taken historic action to eliminate unnecessary, job-killing regulations.
And we’ve just started on that one.
(Applause.)
But we’ve gotten rid of a lot of them.
That includes eliminating regulations crushing our coal industry.
We’re going to put our great coal miners back to work.
Clean coal.
Clean coal.
(Applause.)
I’ve cleared the way for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines — and added a requirement that American pipelines be constructed with American steel.
That was the last minute.
I said, where are we getting the steel?
I won’t tell you where, but you can guess.
I said, from now on we have to go — we have to build them here.
You want to put pipelines under our land you’re going to make the pipe in this country.
(Applause.)
And one other thing happened.
I have to tell you, it’s sort of interesting.
So I get a call from the ex-president of Goldman Sachs who now works for — Gary Cohn.
I said to him, Gary, let me ask you — I heard there was a lawsuit.
I hear the pipeline company is suing us.
I said, how much?
$14 billion.
I said, wait a minute.
I’m approving the pipeline and they’re suing us for $14 billion, and I’ve already approved it, right?
I said, I just heard it.
Go back to them and tell them if they don’t drop the suit immediately we are going to terminate the deal  You have great — you know, being President gives you great power, right?
(Laughter.)
So I just saw him this morning — I said, by the way, how did you do?
He said, sir, they dropped the suit.
Good.
(Applause.)
Isn’t that easier — look, if I’m — do you think Hillary does that?
I don’t think so.
I don’t think so.
Isn’t that easier, though, than settling for like $4 billion seven years from now?
Oh, but the lawyers aren’t happy at all.
They don’t like it.
You got a lot of lawyers in this crowd — they’re not happy about that deal.
Because of the new business climate that we’re creating, jobs are already starting to pour back in — companies like Sprint, Intel, Exxon-Mobile — where a great man, Rex Tillerson, is doing an incredible job — (applause) — ran that company for many years and ran it well.
Walmart, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler and General Motors have all announced that they’re keeping or adding tens of thousands of jobs right here in America.
A big difference.
We used to hear they’re all leaving.
Now they’re all coming back.
They’re coming back, too, believe me.
If they don’t, we’re taxing the hell out of their products, so you know they’re coming back.
(Applause.)
Why didn’t somebody start doing that 25 years ago?
One company said, sir, we’re building a big plant — there’s nothing we can do to stop it.
It’s already under construction.
I said, here’s the story — when you make your cars, or whatever, and you fire all our American employees, and then you think in your new plant — beautiful new plant, congratulations — you’re going to sell that product our border, tax-free, you’re wrong — 35 percent tax.
It’s amazing how quickly they say, you know, I think we’ve decided to stay in the United States.
I only wonder, why didn’t somebody do this like 25 years ago?
You would have had nobody leaving.
So far, I think I’m batting about 100 percent.
To save taxpayer dollars, I’ve already begun negotiating better contracts for the federal government — saving over $700 million on just one set of airplanes of which there are many sets.
As I promised during the campaign, I have proposed a budget that eliminates the defense sequester and fully rebuilds the United States military.
We need it more than ever.
(Applause.)
We need it more than ever.
We’ve got a lot of haters out there — they hate.
We got some people running some countries that are bad people.
We will take care of it.
We will ensure that the America warrior — and if you think about it, the great American warriors — because that’s what they are — are given the tools, the funding, the resources, the training and equipment they so richly deserve.
They are warriors, and they have old equipment.
They’re not going to have old equipment much longer.
And we will take care of our great veterans.
What’s happening there is going to be incredible.
Finally, we’re going to take care of our veterans.
(Applause.)
Our defense expansion will fully pay — and this will be something that is so important — it will be fully paid by making government leaner, more accountable and just perfect for our people.
But I will tell you, if it’s not fully paid — because we’re doing a big number, with the planes and the ships — our Navy is at World War I levels.
Can you believe that?
World War I levels.
So if we don’t fully pay, we’re going to do a little work, but we’re going to get our military rebuilt — bigger and better and stronger than ever — because we have no choice, folks.
There’s some bad players out there.
(Applause.)
And it’s going to go quickly.
I have also followed through on my promise to secure, protect and defend the borders of the United States — and, yes, we will build a great border wall at our Southern border.
(Applause.)
It will be built.
These security actions will save billions of dollars, millions of jobs, and thousands and thousands of lives.
We’re also taking decisive action to improve our vetting procedures.
The courts are not helping us, I have to be honest with you.
Ridiculous.
Somebody said I should not criticize judges.
Okay, I’ll criticize judges.
(Laughter.)
To keep criminals and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We are keeping these promises, and many, many more.
After we repeal and replace Obamacare, our Republican majority will pass massive, historic tax reform — the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and potentially even bigger.
It’s going to be very big.
(Applause.)
And by the way, we had to go — had no choice — had to go with the healthcare first.
You know how it works.
This is one room that really does know how it works.
But we had to go with the healthcare first.
And we’re doing well.
I think we’re going to have some great surprises.
I hope that it’s going to all work out.
Then we immediately start on the tax cuts, and they’re going to be really fantastic, and I am looking forward to that one.
That one is going to be fun.
That one is going to be fun.
That’s called the wheelhouse.
We’re going to do a great job for companies.
We’re going to bring back — could be $3 to $5 trillion from overseas, money that can’t be brought back as part of our taxes.
(Applause.)
And it will lower the business tax rate from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive anywhere in the world.
Way, way down.
(Applause.)
We will do everything we can to lower business burdens and to make it easier for our businesses to thrive and compete.
But in exchange, they must hire, invest and grow in America.
We’re not giving them anything — okay?
They got to do that.
That’s the one thing.
We’re working with the automobile industry who have been played around with.
And I’m saying, we’ll do things for you, but you got to build new plants all over the place.
You got to build new plants in our country.
And they’re doing it, they’re starting.
It’s going to be amazing.
I have called this model, the model that you’ve been watching, the model that’s created so much value, the model of bringing back jobs and bringing back industry — I called it the American Model.
And this is the system that our Founders wanted.
Our greatest American leaders — including George Washington, Hamilton, Jackson, Lincoln — they all agreed that for America to be a strong nation it must also be a great manufacturing nation.
Have to make money.
The Republican platform of 1896 — more than a century ago — stated that: “Protection and reciprocity are twin measures of American policy and go hand in hand.” I mean, we have situations where other countries who have zero respect for our country — by the way, do you notice they’re starting to respect us a lot?
A lot.
A lot.
They’ll charge us 100 percent tax on some — 100 percent.
And we charge them nothing.
They’ll make it impossible through regulations for our product to be sold in their country, and yet they’ll sell their product routinely in our country.
Not going to happen anymore.
The word, “reciprocity” — they do it, we do it.
Who can complain about that?
Big difference.
You’re talking about big, big dollars, too, by the way.
The platform went on to say:  “We renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence and the foundation of American development and prosperity.”

Now, these were some of our greatest leaders, some of whom were great businesspeople.
They understood we have to do it.
And just so you understand, I’m a free trader, but free trade has been very unfair trade.
So I now say I’m a fair trader.
And I want to trade all over the world.
I don’t want to have it just here.
But we’re going to be beneficiaries from now on.
We’re not going to be the people that are taken advantage of any longer.
That’s been happening for decades and decades — not going to happen any longer.
(Applause.)
And they know it.
One country came in to see me recently — big country, good country, great person.
One of his first questions, sir, how much will you be charging us?
It’s like he knew.
He knew.
(Laughter.)
He knew.
They’ve been ripping us for years and he finally saw somebody that understands — so it’s one of those — (laughter.)
You don’t mind having a rich nation again and having lower taxes, do you?
Does anybody here mind?
Anybody mind, please stand up.
I know Dick Cheney will not stand on this one.
Please stand up.
As long as the GOP stands for “Made in the USA,” — remember in the old days, cars all said, “Made in the USA,” right?
We don’t have that too much anymore.
We’re going to have it again soon.
I’m telling all the car companies, put a big label, “Made in the USA” — it’s going to stand for quality.
Our party will have a very, very bright future.
It is fitting that we are in the National Building Museum.
Since its founding, the Republican Party has been a party of builders.
Many of the great builders are in this audience tonight.
Some of them I have to compete with and I really — actually, I don’t like very many of them.
(Laughter.)
Some of them I do.
Some of them I truly dislike a lot.
(Laughter.)
But now I like everybody.
I like all the great builders.
See, now it’s different.
(Laughter.)
Now we’re all on the same side, so I like — see the guy over there?
I couldn’t stand that guy for years.
He did a good job, but I couldn’t stand him.
Now I like you.
(Laughter.)
Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, ran his first campaign for public office in 1832 — when he was only 23 years old.
He began by imagining the benefits a railroad could bring to his port [part] of Illinois — without ever having seen a steam-powered train.
He had no idea, and yet he knew what it could be.
Thirty years later, as President, Lincoln signed the law that built the first Transcontinental Railroad, uniting our country from ocean to ocean.
Great President.
Most people don’t even know he was a Republican, right?
Does anyone know?
Lot of people don’t know that.
We have to build that up a little bit more.
Let’s take an ad — let’s use one of those PACs.
(Laughter.)
Those PACs, you never know what the hell is going to come out of those PACs.
(Laughter.)
You think they’re friendly — although the best ad I ever had was one done against me by Hillary — it was so good, I said I hope she keeps running that ad.
(Laughter.)
Another great Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, had a vision of a national infrastructure plan.
As an officer in the Army after World War I, he joined a military convoy that trekked across the nation to the Pacific Coast.
It traveled along the Lincoln Highway — called then the Lincoln Highway.
Its journey began by the South Lawn of the White House, at a monument known today as Zero Milestone.
Anybody know where that is?
The journey made a great impression on then young Eisenhower.
More than three decades later, as President, he signed the bill that created our great Interstate Highway System — once again uniting us as a nation.
Now is time for a new Republican administration, working with our Republican Congress, to pass the next great infrastructure bill.
(Applause.)
Our party must dream as big and as bold as Lincoln and Eisenhower.
Together, Republicans will lead America into our unbelievable future.
We have so much potential.
We have so much potential.
I see it now even more than I saw it in this great campaign — which turned out to be a movement, a movement like the world has never seen before, actually.
You know, it’s funny, I’ve said that so often, they don’t even correct me — the fake media.
They never correct me, because it’s true.
Oh, believe me, if it’s off by 100th of a percent, it’s like I end up getting Pinocchio’s, right?
They don’t even correct me.
One of the great movements of all time.
And it’s not my movement.
It’s a movement of the people.
It’s been something that’s really been very special.
I’m like a messenger.
I’m nothing more than a messenger.
(Applause.)
I’m a messenger.
I did a good job as a messenger, but I’m a messenger.
It’s been a lot of fun, too.
Imagine the breakthroughs that will breathe fresh life into forgotten places.
Picture the new roads that will carve pathways all across our land — and we need them.
And think of the new inventions that will lift up the sights of our nation.
Finally, as we imagine this new prosperity at home, let us also work to achieve real and enduring peace abroad.
(Applause.)
People don’t realize, I have to say, what a mess we inherited.
I’m telling you, you look at North Korea.
You look at the Middle East.
You look all over.
You look at the horrible, horrible, horrible Iran deal.
I still have not been able to figure out why anybody would have signed that deal.
I asked generals — I have them in my office — I say, General, please tell me why did they sign that deal.
Unbelievable.
But we’re going to straighten things out, folks.
The best Republican Presidents have not only been warfighters, but also peacemakers.
We will never hesitate to do what we must to keep us safe today, but we will always seek a more peaceful tomorrow.
We will, and we will succeed.
(Applause.)
If we stand for these things — safety, prosperity and peace — then there is no limit to what we can achieve:  A future where millions are lifted from welfare to work.
And they’re going to love it.
They’re going to love it.
They’re going to love waking up in the morning, going to work.
Communities thriving with jobs and surging with commerce.
Inner cities filled with new hope and new opportunity.
Schools where our children can learn free from violence and free from fear.
And new frontiers in science, technology and space that inspire the next generation of American youth.
All of this, and so much more, is possible.
Our country is great.
A new national pride is stirring our souls.
A new optimism is sweeping our land.
A new era of American greatness is just beginning.
Somewhere in America tonight, a child is born in poverty, looking up into the sky, and filling their heart with dreams — big, beautiful, bold dreams.
And if we make the right choices together, then no one will ever have to tell that child that their dreams will have to wait for another day, another year, or another decade.
Because the waiting now is over.
The time for action is now.
This is the moment when great deeds are done — and we will do those great deeds.
By putting our faith in the people, and by putting our trust in God, we will rise to this occasion like no one has ever risen before.
(Applause.)
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Great people, great country.
Thank you so much.
We will prove worthy of this moment.
Anything is possible if we stand together, united and strong.
Not just as Republicans — but as great and unified Americans.
Join me in believing in this better and brighter future.
Join me in building this reality.
And join me in rededicating ourselves to the common good of this nation that we all love so much.
Together, we will defend our freedoms.
We will defend our people.
And we will defend our great and beautiful American flag.
(Applause.)
Thank you.
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
SPEECH 15: President Trump Press Conference - Feb. 16, 2017

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.
I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta.
He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student.
Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.
And he has had a tremendous career.
He’s a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed — did very, very well.
And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best.
We just spoke.
And he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.
And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved — weeks late, I have to say that.
Weeks, weeks late.
Office of Management and Budget.
And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition.
Paul Singer has just left.
As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, “Never Trump.” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support.
And it’s all about unification.
We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country.
It’s very important to me.
I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me.
So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.
He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally.
And I appreciate that.
I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions.
And I had this time — we’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible.
Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.
And we’ve done some really good work.
We’re very proud of that.
And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we’ll do some questions — unless you have no questions.
That’s always a possibility.
I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.
We have made incredible progress.
I don’t think there’s ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we’ve done.
A new Rasmussen poll, in fact — because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it.
They actually get it, but they don’t write it — let’s put it that way.
But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.
The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.
And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to.
It used to mean, oh, that’s good.
Now it means that’s good for jobs.
Very different.
Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them.
I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.
And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible.
Maybe it’s not, and that’s okay too.
Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.
The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people — tremendous disservice.
We have to talk about it to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control.
The level of dishonesty is out of control.
I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.
I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.
I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure, we’re talking about its entrenchment.
As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic.
But much of it is not — the distortion.
And we’ll talk about it, and you’ll be able to ask me questions about it.
But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again to take my message straight to the people.
As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.
To be honest, I inherited a mess — it’s a mess — at home and abroad.
A mess.
Jobs are pouring out of the country.
You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places — low-pay, low-wages.
Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.
The Middle East, a disaster.
North Korea — we’ll take care of it, folks.
We’re going to take care of it all.
I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.
Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.
On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders — much of it you’ve covered — to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.
We’ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom — and meetings — Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.
Really, really productive conversations.
I would say far more productive than you would understand.
We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs.
It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.
I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis — he’s over there now, working very hard — to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.
It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world.
They’ve spread like cancer.
ISIS has spread like cancer.
Another mess I inherited.
And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration.
And they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism.
And we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.
And it’s not properly solved now.
It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.
I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.
I’ve had great support from the Senate.
I’ve had great support from Congress generally.
We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.
And I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it.
But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild.
We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment.
And their equipment is old.
I used it, I talked about it at every stop.
Depleted — it’s depleted.
It won’t be depleted for long.
And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.
We have to have strong law enforcement also.
So we do not go abroad in the search of war.
We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength.
At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.
In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people.
These are campaign promises.
Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.
Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half — strong borders.
They’re so surprised — “oh, you’re having strong borders.” Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.
One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.
They lie to the American people in order to get elected.
Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons.
And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.
I’m here following through on what I pledged to do.
That’s all I’m doing.
I put it out before the American people.
Got 306 Electoral College votes.
I wasn’t supposed to get 222.
They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.
Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.
We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before.
So that’s the way it goes.
I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.
In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason.
But a lot of people are happy about it.
In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard — just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.
I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos.
Chaos!
Yet, it is the exact opposite.
This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people.
Like Senator Dan Coates whose there — one of the most respected men of the Senate — he can’t get approved.
How do you not approve him?
He’s been a colleague, highly respected — brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it — but waiting for approval.
So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.
So if the Democrats, who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now — the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me.
Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time.
I just got here.
I got here with no Cabinet.
Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.
So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.
We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.
We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals — bilateral.
We’re going to have one-on-one deals.
We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.
People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.
They go in for a permit — it’s many, many years.
And then at the end of the process — they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense — and at the end of the process, they get rejected.
Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection.
It’s not going to take years.
But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance.
We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs.
We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.
We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.
We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.
We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.
Makes sense.
Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.
If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they’re a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.
And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.
It’s very important to me.
But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.
We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.
We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others — taking place right now in our inner cities.
Horrible.
We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.
We’re becoming a drug-infested nation.
Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer.
We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.
Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process.
And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me.
The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government.
And we’re going to have a wall that works.
We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.
We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.
No more release, no matter who you are — release.
We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety.
We are saving American lives every single day.
The court system has not made it easy for us.
And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.
We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.
Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe — including reporters safe — and is vigorously defending this lawful order.
I will not back down from defending our country.
I got elected on defense of our country.
And I keep my campaign promises.
And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.
They already are.
I can tell you that.
Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places.
In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.
I’ve heard 80 percent — I find that hard to believe; that’s just a number I heard — that they’re overturned 80 percent of the time.
I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil.
But we are appealing that and we are going further.
We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that.
At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.
We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines — thousands and thousands of jobs — and put new “Buy American” measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.
In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen.
We want them to use American steel.
And they’re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.
Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that.
And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel?
And they said, that’s a good idea.
We put it in.
To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Obamacare is a disaster, folks.
It’s a disaster.
You can say, oh, Obamacare — I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.
So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.
We’re bringing our jobs back to this country big league.
It’s already happening, but big league.
I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.
You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years.
That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.
You look at Rex Tillerson — he’s out there negotiating right now.
General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.
We have great, great people.
Mick is with us now.
We have great people.
Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.
Now, look, fair trade — not free — fair.
If a country is taking advantage of us, we’re not going to let that happen anymore.
Every country takes advantage of us, almost.
I may be able to find a couple that don’t.
But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.
Jobs have already started to surge.
Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.
Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.
They were with me a week ago.
You know — you were here.
General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.
And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left.
And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.
Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.
And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.
Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.
There will be many, many more.
Many more.
These are a few that we’re naming.
Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades — decades and decades and decades, folks.
And we’re not going to let that happen anymore.
Not going to let it happen.
And one more thing.
I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution — highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats — you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other.
But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.
This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.
Again, I say it — there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.
And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week.
Some very big things are going to be announced next week.
So we’re just getting started.
We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.
I hope to see you there.
And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.
Mara.
Mara, go ahead.
You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.
Q Did you fire Mike Flynn?
THE PRESIDENT: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.
He respectfully gave it.
He is a man who — there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.
And I was not happy with the way that information was given.
He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw.
What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.
That’s the real problem.
And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.
In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this — they know nothing about it.
They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call.
It’s all fake news.
It’s all fake news.
The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara — and I think it’s very important — the illegal giving out classified information.
And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.
I’ll give you an example.
I called, as you know, Mexico.
It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico.
And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s — I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.
All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.
It’s supposed to be secret.
It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.
Same thing with Australia.
All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.
The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.
Everybody saw this, and I’m saying — the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified?
How do they do it?
You know why?
Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.
But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.
Really ashamed.
Yes, go ahead.
Q Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?
THE PRESIDENT: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong.
If anything, he did something right.
He was coming into office, he looked at the information.
He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do.
They’re supposed to be — and he didn’t just call Russia.
He called and spoke to, both ways — I think there were 30-some-odd countries.
He’s doing the job.
You know, he was just doing his job.
The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember.
So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me.
And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.
But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember.
And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.
Yes.
Q President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I’m looking for some clarification here.
During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?
And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.
And it was very much discredited, as you know.
It was — it’s a joke.
And the people mentioned in the story — I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.
They weren’t even a part, really — I mean, they were such a minor part — I hadn’t spoken to them.
I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him.
I don’t think I’ve ever met him.
And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time.
I don’t think I ever met him.
Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him.
I didn’t talk to him, ever.
And he thought it was a joke.
The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call.
Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.
And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia — but knew that he represented various countries.
That’s what he does.
I mean, people know that.
That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s, by the way — who’s, by the way, a respected man.
He’s a respected man.
But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody.
But everybody — people knew that.
Everybody knew that.
So these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.
And he said that very forcefully.
I saw his statement.
He said it very forcefully.
Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories.
So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.
And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.
I have no loans in Russia.
I don’t have any deals in Russia.
President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.
He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.
But so did many other leaders — almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.
So that’s the extent.
Russia is fake news.
Russia — this is fake news put out by the media.
The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there — because we have our new people going in place right now.
As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA.
James Comey at FBI.
Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.
I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one.
And he’s still waiting to be approved.
But our new people are going in.
And just while you’re at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday.
And it talked about — you saw it, front page.
So, Director of National Intelligence just put out — acting — a statement: “Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community” — this was just given to us — “is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.”

So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal — top — and they just wrote the story is not true.
And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest — because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.
I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.
But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.
How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?
Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?
That was like that story they wrote about the women and me — front page.
Big massive story.
And it was nasty.
And then they called.
They said, “We never said that.
We like Mr. Trump.” They called up my office — we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.
And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you — totally misrepresented.
I said, give us a retraction.
They never gave us a retraction.
And, frankly, I then went on to other things.
Go ahead.
Q Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: You okay?
Q I am.
Just wanted to get untangled.
Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.
In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m talking about Republican.
Yes.
Q President Obama, 332.
George H.W.
Bush, 426 when he won as President.
So why should Americans trust —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I was told — I was given that information.
I don’t know.
I was just given.
We had a very, very big margin.
Q I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you’re providing information that’s fake?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don’t know.
I was given that information.
I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around.
But it was a very substantial victory.
Do you agree with that?
Q You’re the President.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you.
That’s a good answer.
Yes.
Q Mr. President, thank you so much.
Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn — there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?
Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?
What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?
And further than that, sir, you’ve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.
THE PRESIDENT: We are.
Q Can we ask what you’re doing to do?
And also, we’ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.
What can you tell us about that?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position.
So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.
The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man.
And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of.
But I don’t think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we’re going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.
As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn’t sound wrong.
My counsel came — Don McGahn, White House Counsel — and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself.
He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong.
He really didn’t think — it was really what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong.
I didn’t either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it.
I said, well, I don’t see — to me, he was doing the job.
The information was provided by — who I don’t know — Sally Yates — and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there.
But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.
As far as the actual making the call — in fact, I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.
That was very normal.
At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.
After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.
So — and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man.
Yes, Jon.
Q On the leaks, sir —

THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, finish off, then I’ll get you, Jon.
Q Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?
You have said twice today —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we’re looking at it very, very seriously.
I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.
Those are criminal leaks.
They’re put out by people either in agencies.
I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.
You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate.
We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.
So we are looking into that very seriously.
It’s a criminal act.
You know what I say — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.
Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.
When I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised.
But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense, that won’t happen.
But that wasn’t that important to call, it was fine.
I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world — the President who is a very fine man, by the way.
Same thing with Australia.
I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked but it wasn’t that important.
But then I said, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?
What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East?
Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information — very important, very — I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?
So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public.
And in a way, that was almost a test.
So I’m dealing with Mexico.
I’m dealing with Argentina.
We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.
All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.
And I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East?
What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?
We’ve got to stop it.
That’s why it’s a criminal penalty.
Yes, Jon.
Q Thank you, Mr. President.
I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.
Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?
And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, the leaks are real.
You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them.
I mean, the leaks are real.
You know what they said — you saw it.
And the leaks are absolutely real.
The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.
So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit — than reporters, than good reporters.
It’s very important to me, and especially in this position.
It’s very important.
I don’t mind bad stories.
I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true.
And over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that.
But I’m not okay when it is fake.
I mean, I watch CNN — it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.
I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no.
It’s okay, Jim.
It’s okay, Jim.
You’ll have your chance.
But I watch others too.
You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly.
But I think it should be straight.
I think it should be — I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.
I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be — I think that it would actually be better.
People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.
I think that’s right.
I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?
Because you know, I think they have lower — I heard, lower than Congress.
But honestly, the public would appreciate it.
I’d appreciate it.
Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true.
But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.
I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.
I mean, the numbers are crazy.
When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately.
I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.
And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying.
And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going.
The only thing they can do is delay.
And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good.
And sometimes, I mean — I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.
And that’s okay.
That’s fine.
But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.
This is pure delay tactics.
And they say it, and everybody understands it.
Yeah, go ahead, Jim.
Q The first part of my question on contacts.
Do you definitively say that nobody —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I had nothing to do with it.
I have nothing to do with Russia.
I told you, I have no deals there.
I have no anything.
Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give — they’re not giving classified information.
They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates — which, by the way, nobody mentions.
Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.
Can you imagine — seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?
It would be the electric chair, okay?
“He should be put in the electric chair.” You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?
Maybe not you, Jon.
Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim.
I’ll do you next.
Yes?
Q Thank you, Mr. President.
I just want to clarify one other thing.
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
Q Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn’t.
No, I didn’t.
Q (Inaudible.)
(Off mic.)
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn’t.
Q Did you fire him because (inaudible) —

THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me — no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.
Mike was doing his job.
He was calling countries and his counterparts.
So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.
I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.
I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.
And it came out that way — and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.
And I agreed with him.
And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.
No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?
Jim.
Q Mr. President, thank you very much.
And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.
If you could pass that along.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay.
Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?
Q If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, not too many.
We do have other people.
You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.
Q They’re pretty good right now, actually.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay.
Go ahead, Jim.
Q If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.
You welcomed that at one point.
THE PRESIDENT: I was okay with it.
Q You said you loved WikiLeaks.
At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.
I’m wondering, sir, if you —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.
Q Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.
THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.
Q If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, fair question.
Ready?
Q So if I may ask you that — if I may ask a follow-up —

THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but are you — let me do one at a time.
Do you mind?
Q Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: All right.
So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.
In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.
I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.
He said terrible things about her.
But it wasn’t classified information.
But in one case you’re talking about classified.
Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong — at my suggestion — and I give Reince great credit for this — at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.
I don’t want to be hacked.
And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.
The DNC did not do that.
And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.
But they were hacked, and terrible things came.
And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so — they were — when I heard some of those things, I said — I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.
It wasn’t even in the papers.
Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.
I would have been the headline in every newspaper.
I mean, think of it.
They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.
Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, “I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job”?
Q And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about — you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.
I guess I don’t understand.
It seems that there is a disconnect there.
If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, the reporting is fake.
Look, look —

Q And if I may ask — I just want to ask one other question.
THE PRESIDENT: Jim, you know what it is?
Here’s the thing.
The public isn’t — they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.
They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved.
I’m involved.
I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.
But I’m involved.
So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not.
I just see many, many untruthful things.
And I tell you what else I see.
I see tone.
You know the word “tone.” The tone is such hatred.
I’m really not a bad person, by the way.
No, but the tone is such — I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.
The tone is such hatred.
I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say “Fox & Friends” in the morning, they’re very honorable people.
They’re very — not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.
But they have the most honest morning show.
That’s all I can say.
It’s the most honest.
But the tone, Jim.
If you look — the hatred.
I mean, sometimes — sometimes somebody gets —

Q (Off mic.)
THE PRESIDENT: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening.
You just take a look at that show.
That is a constant hit.
The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.
The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings.
But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.
And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.
Now, I will say this.
I watch it.
I see it.
I’m amazed by it.
And I just think you’d be a lot better off — I honestly do.
The public gets it, you know.
Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.
They want to throw their placards at CNN.
I think you would do much better by being different.
But you just take a look.
Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.
If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.
Now, they’ll take this news conference.
I’m actually having a very good time, okay?
But they’ll take this news conference — don’t forget that’s the way I won.
Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.
Q (Off mic.)
THE PRESIDENT: No, that’s how I won.
I won with news conferences and probably speeches.
I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people, that’s for sure.
But I am having a good time.
Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.
I’m not ranting and raving.
I’m just telling you, you’re dishonest people.
But — but I’m not ranting and raving.
I love this.
I’m having a good time doing it.
But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves.
I’m not ranting and raving.
Q If I may just —

THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.
Q One more follow-up because —

THE PRESIDENT: Should I let him have a little bit more?
What do you think, Peter?
Q Just because of this —

THE PRESIDENT: Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Q Just because of the attack —

THE PRESIDENT: We’ll get it.
Q Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir —

THE PRESIDENT: I’m changing it from fake news, though.
Q Doesn’t that undermine —

THE PRESIDENT: Very fake news now.
(Laughter.)
Q But aren’t you —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.
Q Real news, Mr. President.
Real news.
THE PRESIDENT: And you’re not related to our new —

Q I am not related, sir, no.
(Laughter.)
I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.
THE PRESIDENT: I looked — you know, I looked at that name.
I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?
Alex Acosta.
Q I’m sure you checked that out, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: No, I checked it.
I said — they said, no, sir.
I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.
Q But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don’t like “fake news”?
Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like?
THE PRESIDENT: I do that.
Q When you call it fake news, you’re undermining confidence —

THE PRESIDENT: No, I do that.
No, no, I do that.
Q — in our news media.
THE PRESIDENT: Here’s the thing.
Q Isn’t that important?
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, I understand — and you’re right about that except this.
See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.
And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that’s going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed.
I know what’s good and bad.
I’d be a pretty good reporter — not as good as you.
But I know what’s good.
I know what’s bad.
And when they change it and make it really bad — something that should be positive.
Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay.
They’ll even make it negative.
So I understand it because I’m there.
I know what was said.
I know who is saying it.
I’m there.
So it’s very important to me.
Look, I want to see an honest press.
When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.
The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.
Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don’t know.
But they don’t believe you.
If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?
Of course, he had some questions also.
But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world — including bad stories about me.
But if you go — as an example, you’re CNN — I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad.
I won.
I won.
And the other thing: Chaos.
There’s zero chaos.
We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine.
And Reince happens to be doing a good job.
But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.
I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.
But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.
And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.
I mean, we won the election, right?
We won the presidency.
We got some senators.
We got some — all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job.
And I said to myself, you know — and I said to somebody that was in the room — I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.
They’re fake.
They’re not true.
And isn’t that a shame, because he’d rather be working on health care.
He’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim.
I mean that.
I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.
I sort of understand there’s a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody — for whatever reason.
And I understand that.
But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair.
And that’s why the public sees it — they see it.
They see it’s not fair.
You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.
And the public is smart.
They understand it.
Okay, yeah, go ahead.
Q We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).
But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news?
And secondly —

THE PRESIDENT: I think they don’t believe it.
I don’t think the public would.
That’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.
I don’t think they believe it.
Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing — that’s a ruse.
That’s a ruse.
And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.
Now, tomorrow you’ll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.
It’s not terrible — it’s good.
We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.
We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.
You know what uranium is, right?
It’s this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.
Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.
Nobody talks about that.
I didn’t do anything for Russia.
I’ve done nothing for Russia.
Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.
Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?
Here, take a look.
He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?
Hillary Clinton — that was a reset.
Remember?
It said “reset.”

Now, if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy.
If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing.
We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly.
And I told him, I said, I know politically it’s probably not good for me.
Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water.
Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it’s so great.
That’s not great.
That’s not great.
I would love to be able to get along with Russia.
Now, you’ve had a lot of Presidents that haven’t taken that tact.
Look where we are now.
Look where we are now.
So, if I can — now, I love to negotiate things.
I do it really well and all that stuff, but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin.
Maybe it is.
But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people — the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.
And probably Putin said, you know — he’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying, you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it’s got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story.
Okay?
And that’s a shame.
Because if we could get along with Russia — and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone — if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.
Q Tax reform —

Q Mr. President, since you —

THE PRESIDENT: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.
We’re doing Obamacare — we’re in final stages.
We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.
And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.
It’s not like — frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.
So we’ll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.
And after that, we’re going to come up — and we’re doing very well on tax reform.
Yes.
Q Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.
Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay.
Q You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.
THE PRESIDENT: Not good.
Q There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation —

THE PRESIDENT: Not good.
Q — of the agreement between the two countries.
And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.
THE PRESIDENT: Not good.
Q I listened to you during the campaign —

THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?
It happened when — if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States.
There’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the — you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn’t that wonderful.
But I know you well enough.
Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn’t have done that.
Look, of all —

Q I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those —

THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
Excuse me just one second.
Q I’m just trying to find out what you’re doing to do about them, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal.
So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.
They all tried.
But I’m different than those people.
Go ahead.
Q How are you interpreting those moves?
And what do you intend to do about them?
THE PRESIDENT: Just the way I said it.
Q Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?
THE PRESIDENT: I have.
I have.
And I’m so beautifully represented.
I’m so honored that the Senate approved him.
He’s going to be fantastic.
Yes, I think that I’ve already —

Q Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I don’t think so.
I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.
I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now.
Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal.
Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal.
I don’t know.
We might, we might not.
But it would be much easier for me to be so tough — the tougher I am on Russia, the better.
But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.
And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.
If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.
There’s no upside.
We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.
I’ve been briefed.
And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.
They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.
If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.
Q So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are —

THE PRESIDENT: Who did I say is not good?
Q No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they’re not good.
THE PRESIDENT: No, it’s not good, but they happened.
Q But do they damage the relationship?
Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?
THE PRESIDENT: They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing.
Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.
And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?
Does anybody in this room really believe that?
Okay.
But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal.
She had the reset.
She gave all the valuable uranium away.
She did other things.
You know, they say I’m close to Russia.
Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.
She’s close to Russia.
I gave — you know what I gave to Russia?
You know what I gave?
Nothing.
Q Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?
THE PRESIDENT: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.
I don’t talk about military response.
I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.
“We are going to attack Mosul in four months.” Then three months later: “We are going to attack Mosul in one month.” “Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.” In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.
Do you know why?
Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.
You’re going to be surprised to hear that.
And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that.
So I don’t have to tell you —

Q There will be a response?
THE PRESIDENT: I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.” I don’t have to do that.
Q There will be a — in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.
Wait a minute.
I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.
And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.
You know why?
Because they shouldn’t know.
And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.
So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship — the Russian ship, as an example — I’m not going to tell you.
But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything.
But I’m not going to tell you.
Okay.
Q Thanks.
Q Can I just ask you — thank you very much, Mr. President — the Trump —

THE PRESIDENT: Where are you from?
Q BBC.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay.
Here’s another beauty.
Q That’s a good line.
Impartial, free, and fair.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure.
Q Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: Just like CNN, right?
Q Mr. President, on the travel ban — we could banter back and forth.
On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned —

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I do.
I do.
And let me tell you about the travel —

Q Were there any mistakes in that?
THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait.
I know who you are.
Just wait.
Let me tell you about the travel ban.
We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.
We got a bad decision.
We had a court that’s been overturned — again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time.
A lot.
We had a bad decision.
We’re going to keep going with that decision.
We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.
But we had a bad decision.
That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.
You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.
You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.
Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.
We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.
Very bad for the safety and security of our country.
The rollout was perfect.
Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing — and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time.
But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month — the bad ones.
You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?
They’re not everybody that’s like you.
You have some bad people out there.
So Kelly said, you can’t do that.
And he was right.
As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.
I said, how about one week?
He said, no good.
You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in.
Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly.
Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.
The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.
Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly.
Very, very strongly.
But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.
Q Just a brief follow-up.
And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.
Q Thank you.
I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.
Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.
So that’s one person.
But he was dealing — as he should have been —

Q During the election?
THE PRESIDENT: No, no, nobody that I know of.
Q So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?
Q Can you just say yes or no on it?
THE PRESIDENT: Russia is a ruse.
Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.
Russia is a ruse.
I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years.
Don’t speak to people from Russia.
Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to.
I spoke to Putin twice.
He called me on the election — I told you this — and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago.
We had a very good talk, especially the second one — lasted for a pretty long period of time.
I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.
But we had a very, very good talk.
I have nothing to do with Russia.
To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.
Now, Manafort has totally denied it.
He denied it.
Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.
I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that — whoever.
But people knew that.
Everybody knew that.
Q But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?
THE PRESIDENT: I have — you know what, he said no.
I can only tell you what he — now, he was replaced long before the election.
You know that, right?
He was replaced long before the election.
When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.
But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way — Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.
He was only there for a short period of time.
How much longer should we stay here, folks?
Five more minutes, is that okay?
Five?
Q Mr. President, on national security —

THE PRESIDENT: Wait, let’s see, who’s — I want to find a friendly reporter.
Are you a friendly reporter?
Watch how friendly he is.
Wait, wait — watch how friendly he is.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Q So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.
And (inaudible).
I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the — anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic.
We have an understanding of (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Q However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.
There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.
There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to —

THE PRESIDENT: You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.
And it’s not.
It’s not.
Not a simple question, not a fair question.
Okay, sit down.
I understand the rest of your question.
So here’s the story, folks.
Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.
Number two, racism — the least racist person.
In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.
Q (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: Quiet, quiet, quiet.
See, he lied about — he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.
So you know, welcome to the world of the media.
But let me just tell you something — that I hate the charge.
I find it repulsive.
I hate even the question because people that know me — and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday — did you hear him, Bibi?
He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.
So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.
Yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Q Thank you.
I’m Lisa from the PBS —

THE PRESIDENT: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.
Q Thank you, Mr. President.
Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.
THE PRESIDENT: Good.
Q On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?
Will it be focused on specific countries?
THE PRESIDENT: It’s a very fair question.
Q And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?
Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?
THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to show great heart.
DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.
To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases — not in all cases.
In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too.
But you have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly — they were brought here in such a way — it’s a very, very tough subject.
We are going to deal with DACA with heart.
I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget, and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right.
And I appreciate your understanding on that.
But the DACA situation is a very, very — it’s a very difficult thing for me.
Because, you know, I love these kids.
I love kids.
I have kids and grandkids.
And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.
And you know, the law is rough.
I’m not talking about new laws.
I’m talking the existing law is very rough.
It’s very, very rough.
As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more.
But we’re tailoring it now to the decision.
We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.
And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.
Okay?
Q Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.
Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?
And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?
THE PRESIDENT: Now, that’s what I call a nice question.
That is very nice.
Who are you with?
Q (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: Good.
I’m going to start watching.
Thank you very much.
Melania is terrific.
She was here last night.
We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.
And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.
And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans.
And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.
That’s right, she just opened up the Visitors Center — in other words, touring of the White House.
She, like others that she’s working with, feels very, very strongly about women’s issues, women’s difficulties, very, very strongly.
And she’s a very, very strong advocate.
I think she’s a great representative for this country.
And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.
The things they say — I’ve known her for a long time.
She was a very successful person.
She was a very successful model.
She did really well.
She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people.
She was a very private person.
She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find.
And the things they say — and I’ve known her for a long time — the things they say are so unfair.
And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.
I’d just tell you this: I think she’s going to be a fantastic First Lady.
She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.
And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.
And they’re not doing this for money.
They’re not doing this for pay.
They’re doing this because they feel it, both of them.
And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school — because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left — she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.
Thank you.
That’s a very nice question.
Go ahead.
Q Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that’s okay.
Q No, it’s not going to be a bad question.
THE PRESIDENT: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.
Q Well, thank you so much.
Mr. President, I need to find out from you — you said something as it relates to inner cities.
That was one of your platforms during your campaign.
THE PRESIDENT: Fix the inner cities, yes.
Q Fixing the inner cities.
What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that’s coming out this afternoon?
See, it wasn’t bad, was it?
THE PRESIDENT: That was very professional and very good.
Q I’m very professional.
THE PRESIDENT: We’ll be announcing the order in a little while, and I’d rather let the order speak for itself.
But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.
But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.
As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.
I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.
We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.
And, by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.
So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.
We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible — you know it takes a long time.
It’s taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.
But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.
And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime.
You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime.
You have people — and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it.
In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it.
They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.
They’re living in hell.
We can’t let that happen.
So we’re going to be very, very strong.
It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years.
It’s been festering for many, many years.
But we have places in this country that we have to fix.
We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there — Hispanic American people.
We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell.
I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.
There are two Chicagos, as you know.
There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe.
There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.
So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.
I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.
Q Well, when you say — when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your —

THE PRESIDENT: Am I going include who?
Q Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would.
I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?
Do you want to set up the meeting?
Q No, no, no.
THE PRESIDENT: Are they friends of yours?
Q I’m just a reporter.
THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead, set up the meeting.
Q I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.
THE PRESIDENT: Let’s go set up a meeting.
I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.
I think it’s great — the Congressional Black Caucus.
I think it’s great.
I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting.
I was all set to have the meeting.
You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.
I spoke to him on the phone.
Very nice guy.
Q I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.
THE PRESIDENT: He wanted it.
But we called, called, called, called — they can’t make a meeting with him.
Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.
Because I do want to solve the problem.
But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that — some other lightweight — he was probably told — he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.
And that’s part of the problem of this country.
Okay, one more.
Go ahead.
Q Yes, Mr. President, two questions —

THE PRESIDENT: No, no.
One question.
Two, we can’t handle.
This room can’t handle two.
Go ahead, give me the better of your two.
Q (Inaudible) it’s not about your personality or your beliefs.
We’re talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.
What do you —

THE PRESIDENT: And some of it — and can I be honest with you?
And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.
Some of it written by our opponents.
You do know that.
Do you understand that?
You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.
Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight.
No.
But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.
They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.
It won’t be my people.
It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Q You are the President now.
What are you going to do about it?
THE PRESIDENT: Who is that?
Where is that?
Oh, stand up.
You can —

Q What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I’m working on it.
No, I’m working on it very hard.
Q Are you going to give a speech?
THE PRESIDENT: No, no, look.
Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama.
Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.
I didn’t come along and divide this country.
This country was seriously divided before I got here.
We’re going to work on it very hard.
One of the questions that was asked — I thought it was a very good question — was about the inner cities.
I mean, that’s part of it.
But we’re going to work on education.
We’re going to work on lack — you know, we’re going to stop — we’re going to try and stop the crime.
We have great law enforcement officials.
We’re going to try and stop crime.
We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime.
But it’s very important to me.
But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation.
We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama.
We lived in a divided nation.
And I am going to try — I will do everything within my power to fix that.
I want to thank everybody very much.
It’s a great honor to be with you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause.)
SPEECH 16: President Trump Remarks on African American History Month - Feb. 2, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.
These are a lot of my friends, but you have been so helpful.
And we did well.
The election, it came out really well.
Next time we’ll triple it up or quadruple it, right?
We want to get over 51, right?
At least 51.
Well, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together.
Hi, Lynne, how are you?
MS. PATTON:  Hi, how are you?
THE PRESIDENT:  Nice to see you.
And just a few notes.
During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African Americans throughout our country — throughout the world, if you really think about it, right?
And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.
I’ve gotten a real glimpse — during the campaign, I’d go around with Ben to a lot of different places that I wasn’t so familiar with.
They’re incredible people.
And I want to thank Ben Carson, who’s going to be heading up HUD.
It’s a big job, and it’s a job that’s not only housing, it’s mind and spirit, right, Ben?
And you understand that.
Nobody is going to be better than Ben.
Last month, we celebrated the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history.
You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office, and it turned out that that was fake news.
(Laughter.)
It was fake news.
The statue is cherished.
It’s one of the favorite things in the — and we have some good ones.
We have Lincoln and we have Jefferson and we have Dr. Martin Luther King, and we have — but they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office.
And it was never even touched.
So I think it was a disgrace, but that’s the way the press is.
Very unfortunate.
I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things.
Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice — Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today.
Big impact.
I am proud to honor this heritage, and we’ll be honoring it more and more.
The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters.
And Darrell — I met Darrell when he was defending me on television.
(Laughter.)
And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn’t have a chance, right?
And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community.
(Laughter.)
He’s all by himself — seven people and Paris.
So I’ll take Paris over the seven.
(Laughter.)
But I don’t watch CNN so I don’t get to see you as much as I want to.
(Laughter.)
I don’t like watching fake news.
PARTICIPANT:  None of us watch it either anymore.
THE PRESIDENT:  But Fox has treated me very nice — wherever Fox is, thank you.
We’re going to need better schools, and we need them soon.
We need more jobs, we need better wages — a lot better wages.
We’re going to work very hard on the inner city.
Ben is going to be doing that big league.
It’s one of his big things that we’re going to be looking at.
We need safer communities, and we’re going to do that with law enforcement.
We’re going to make it safe.
We’re going to make it much better than it is right now.
Right now it’s terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really — you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show.
I’m ready to do my part — it’s the only time I can see him.
I’m ready to do my part, and I will say this:  We’re going to work together.
This is a great group.
This is a group that’s been so special to me.
You really helped me a lot.
If you remember, I wasn’t going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting — I won’t go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.
And now, we’re going to take that to new levels.
I want to thank my television star over here.
(Laughter.)
Omarosa is actually a very nice person.
Nobody knows that, but — (laughter) — I don’t want to destroy her reputation.
She is a very good person and she’s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign.
And I appreciate it.
I really do.
Very special.
And so I want to thank everybody for being here.
Could we maybe just go around the room and we’ll introduce ourselves.
And the press can stay for that, and I’m sure they have no questions about last night because it was such a good launch.
We have a fantastic, hopefully, new justice of the Supreme Court.
And hopefully, that will be — he’ll be approved very, very quickly.
He’s outstanding in every way — academically.
He’s done almost as well as you did, Darrell, in college.
(Laughter.)
Not quite, right?
But he’s a great man and I think he’ll be a great, great justice.
And he’s being very well-received.
It was a big evening.
Very big evening.
So, Paris, why don’t we start with you?
Go ahead.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m glad you’re in support of me because I’d be all — I’d be in the wilderness without you guys.
You are so effective.
I appreciate it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, good.
THE PRESIDENT:  Lieutenant Colonel — good job.
THE PRESIDENT:  You know, the one thing I didn’t understand about Belinda — I thought they were married maybe five or six years, because look how they look so young.
(Laughter.)
Should you say how many years you’ve been married?
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s actually amazing.
I wouldn’t have known.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control.
THE PRESIDENT:  If they’re not going to solve the problem — and what you’re doing is the right thing — then we’re going to solve the problem for them because we’re going to have to do something about Chicago.
Because what’s happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
THE PRESIDENT:  I understand.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I love it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
And it is — I mean, a lot of the media is actually the opposition party.
They’re so biased and really is a disgrace.
Some of you are fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party and knowingly saying incorrect things.
So it’s a very sad situation.
But we seem to be doing well.
It’s almost like, in the meantime, we won.
So maybe they don’t have the influence they think, but they really are — they really have to straighten out their act.
They’re very dishonest people.
James.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
You’ve been great.
Thank you, James.
And, Lynne.
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, that’s great.
You’ve got a good person.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.
You did a fantastic job.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  We did well in West Virginia.
(Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  And we love the coal miners.
We’re going to put them back to work.
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, really?
Great job.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay, well, that’s nice.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.
THE PRESIDENT:  Howard graduate.
That’s good stuff.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
SPEECH 17: President Trump Statement on Immigration - Jan. 29, 2017

America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border.
America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave.
We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say.
My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.
The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.
To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.
This is not about religion – this is about terror and keeping our country safe.
There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.
We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.
I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria.
My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.
SPEECH 18: Remarks by President Trump and Vice President Pence at CIA Headquarters - Jan. 21, 2017

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I want to thank everybody.
Very, very special people.
And it is true, this is my first stop, officially.
We’re not talking about the balls, or we’re not talking about even the speeches — although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday.
(Laughter.)
I always call them the dishonest media, but they treated me nicely.
(Laughter.)
But I want to say that there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump.
There’s nobody.
(Applause.)
The wall behind me is very, very special.
We’ve been touring for quite a while, and I’ll tell you what — 29?
I can’t believe it.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Twenty-eight.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, 28.
We got to reduce it.
That’s amazing.
And we really appreciate what you’ve done in terms of showing us something very special.
And your whole group, these are really special, amazing people.
Very, very few people could do the job you people do.
And I want to just let you know, I am so behind you.
And I know maybe sometimes you haven’t gotten the backing that you’ve wanted, and you’re going to get so much backing.
Maybe you’re going to say, please don’t give us so much backing.
(Laughter.)
Mr. President, please, we don’t need that much backing.
(Laughter.)
But you’re going to have that.
And I think everybody in this room knows it.
You know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it — but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes.
We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military.
And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did.
(Laughter.)
But I would guarantee a big portion, because we’re all on the same wavelength, folks.
(Applause.)
We’re all on the same wavelength, right?
He knows.
It took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we’re on the same wavelength.
But we’re going to do great things.
We’re going to do great things.
We’ve been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we’ve ever fought.
We have not used the real abilities that we have.
We’ve been restrained.
We have to get rid of ISIS.
Have to get rid of ISIS.
We have no choice.
(Applause.)
Radical Islamic terrorism.
And I said it yesterday — it has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth.
This is evil.
This is evil.
And you know, I can understand the other side.
We can all understand the other side.
There can be wars between countries, there can be wars.
You can understand what happened.
This is something nobody can even understand.
This is a level of evil that we haven’t seen.
And you’re going to go to it, and you’re going to do a phenomenal job.
But we’re going to end it.
It’s time.
It’s time right now to end it.
You have somebody coming on who is extraordinary.
For the different positions of “Secretary of This” and “Secretary of That” and all of these great positions, I’d see five, six, seven, eight people.
And we had a great transition.
We had an amazing team of talent.
And, by the way, General Flynn is right over here.
Put up your hand.
What a good guy.
(Applause.)
And Reince and my whole group.
Reince — you know — they don’t care about Reince.
He’s like this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right?
We don’t have to talk about Reince.
But we did — we had such a tremendous, tremendous success.
So when I’m interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and, in this case, went so quickly — because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia.
Fantastic guy.
But I’d see six, seven, eight people for a certain position.
Everybody wanted it.
But I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met.
I didn’t want to meet anybody else.
I said, cancel everybody else.
Cancel.
Now, he was approved, essentially, but they’re doing little political games with me.
He was one of the three.
Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved.
(Applause.)
And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group.
It was going to be the three of them.
Can you imagine all of these guys?
People respect — you know, they respect that military sense.
All my political people, they’re not doing so well.
The political people aren’t doing so well but you.
We’re going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others.
But Mike was literally — I had a group of — what, we had nine different people?
Now, I must say, I didn’t mind cancelling eight appointments.
That wasn’t the worst thing in the world.
But I met him and I said, he is so good.
Number one in his class at West Point.
Now, I know a lot about West Point.
I’m a person that very strongly believes in academics.
In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways, academically — was an academic genius — and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual?
Trust me, I’m like a smart persona.
(Laughter.)
And I recognized immediately.
So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School.
And then he decided to go into the military.
And he ran for Congress.
And everything he’s done has been a home run.
People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him.
And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled — right, Mike?
Because he said, I don’t want to lose this guy.
But you will be getting a total star.
You’re going to be getting a total gem.
He’s a gem.
(Applause.)
You’ll see.
You’ll see.
And many of you know him anyway.
But you’re going to see.
And again, we have some great people going in.
But this one is something — is going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps — you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important.
You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing.
And the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful.
But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier.
And, boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly.
And that’s what we have to do.
We have to start winning again.
You know, when I was young and when I was — of course, I feel young.
I feel like I’m 30, 35, 39.
(Laughter.)
Somebody said, are you young?
I said, I think I’m young.
You know, I was stopping — when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops.
Speeches, speeches, in front of 25,000, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop.
I feel young.
When I was young — and I think we’re all sort of young.
When I was young, we were always winning things in this country.
We’d win with trade.
We’d win with wars.
At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, “The United States has never lost a war.” And then, after that, it’s like we haven’t won anything.
We don’t win anymore.
The old expression, “to the victor belong the spoils” — you remember.
I always used to say, keep the oil.
I wasn’t a fan of Iraq.
I didn’t want to go into Iraq.
But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong.
And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil.
Now, I said it for economic reasons.
But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn’t have ISIS because that’s where they made their money in the first place.
So we should have kept the oil.
But okay.
(Laughter.)
Maybe you’ll have another chance.
But the fact is, should have kept the oil.
I believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems.
We have so many problems that are interrelated that we don’t even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused.
So I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent.
And the reason you’re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media.
They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth.
(Laughter and applause.)
And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.
And I just want to let you know, the reason you’re the number-one stop is exactly the opposite — exactly.
And they understand that, too.
And I was explaining about the numbers.
We did a thing yesterday at the speech.
Did everybody like the speech?
(Applause.)
I’ve been given good reviews.
But we had a massive field of people.
You saw them.
Packed.
I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field.
I say, wait a minute, I made a speech.
I looked out, the field was — it looked like a million, million and a half people.
They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.
And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well.
I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, we’re not going to let it rain on your speech.
In fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no.
The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops.
And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we’ll go right through it.
But the truth is that it stopped immediately.
It was amazing.
And then it became really sunny.
And then I walked off and it poured right after I left.
It poured.
But, you know, we have something that’s amazing because we had — it looked — honestly, it looked like a million and a half people.
Whatever it was, it was.
But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.
And I turn on — and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field.
And it said we drew 250,000 people.
Now, that’s not bad, but it’s a lie.
We had 250,000 people literally around — you know, in the little bowl that we constructed.
That was 250,000 people.
The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed.
So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty.
And I think they’re going to pay a big price.
We had another one yesterday, which was interesting.
In the Oval Office there’s a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King.
And I also happen to like Churchill, Winston Churchill.
I think most of us like Churchill.
He doesn’t come from our country, but had a lot to do with it.
Helped us; real ally.
And, as you know, the Churchill statue was taken out — the bust.
And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly.
And they wanted to know whether or not I’d like it back.
I say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill.
So a reporter for Time magazine — and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times.
I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine.
Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, it’s one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right?
(Laughter.)
I’ve been on it for 15 times this year.
I don’t think that’s a record, Mike, that can ever be broken.
Do you agree with that?
What do you think?
But I will say that they said — it was very interesting — that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King.
And it was right there.
But there was a cameraman that was in front of it.
(Laughter.)
So Zeke — Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down.
I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King.
But this is how dishonest the media is.
Now, the big story — the retraction was, like, where?
Was it a line?
Or do they even bother putting it in?
So I only like to say that because I love honesty.
I like honest reporting.
I will tell you, final time — although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in — because I am coming back — we’re going to have to get you a larger room.
(Applause.)
We may have to get you a larger room.
You know?
And maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we won’t have columns.
(Laughter.)
You understand that?
(Applause.)
We get rid of the columns.
No, I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you.
There’s nobody I respect more.
You’re going to do a fantastic job.
And we’re going to start winning again, and you’re going to be leading the charge.
So thank you all very much.
(Applause.)
Thank you — you’re beautiful.
Thank you all very much.
Have a good time.
I’ll be back.
I’ll be back.
Thank you.
Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform without restriction. It’s called Freedom of Speech remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!
Twitter has removed many people from my account and more importantly they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship now it is a Blimp! Total Bias?
Twitter “SHADOW BANNING” prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.
Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon the Washington Post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don’t exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years!
Twitter will soon be irrelevant if lowlifes are so easily able to hack into accounts.
Twitter is on @BarackObama's enemies list <URL>
