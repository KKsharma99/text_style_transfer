Do you want to set up the meeting?When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.What Jeb Bush was saying at the last debate?Look at my hands.Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.Im going to do something about it.We cant.I go remember he got elected  "I like Ike"....Were doing really well.And I want to trade all over the world.He was vibrant.The New York Times to me is a big deal.So, no, thats not true.Thank you.So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.We went up in June.They couldn’t get them into these massive arenas — there’s something going on that’s really incredible in this country.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.(Applause.)I made robocalls for Mitt Romney.It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.Ill do it.People that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall.There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.And now all of a sudden theyre going into Syria.We go for the knock-out.Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.We’re having a big opening in two weeks.And Ill tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values.So come to America, where you can innovate, create, and build.So they’ll keep their money.WE'RE THE PIGGY BANK.Who the hell knows?"Okay, how about just a couple more.Petraeus was, you know, essentially  look, I dont want to get into it with the poor guy.We have the highest employment numbers we’ve ever had in the history of our country.YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THIS ROOM.Changes for business  now, so important, because its all about business.You know, the funny thing about The Apprentice  there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice.So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.As well as law enforcement officers, police, all across the country.They go this way, 10 feet.[Audience response inaudible]
Like he was helping her.Iowa.Then Obama got out the wrong way.This can go on forever.Whats giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that Ive met  the incredible people of this country.They have to do it.And the evangelicals  he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they dont like liars and they see he lies so much.When Ford moves to Mexico, Im going to talk them out of it.I have no oil company.(Laughter.)So I said (ph), "No, thats the wrong number.Same thing with Australia.It’ll come out.It’s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.(Applause.)Thats a good  I can do great job at $10 billion.I do, and I always will.Thank you.As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi, were the words "Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."Weve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now theyre starting to look elsewhere for help.We have rewarded the worlds leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what were getting.But Ive taken a lot of heat on this one.Theyre like gamblers.Thats with 14 people, 15 people.In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but its going to get worse and worse.The other group didn’t have a permit.They were going to put regulations on.It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.He actually has nuclear weapons, right?They worked  they gave them a party.Ill find that person.But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.I mean, Lindsey Graham.You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office, and it turned out that that was fake news.We use political hacks that dont know what theyre doing.Now, remember this, I go every night to someplace.Chinas unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.Hey, Im the most conservative on the border.We’ve massively cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard-earned money.They just wipe the place out and they couldve stayed there for longer.Unlike a lot of reporters —

Q    Nazis were there.Ive done well in the debates.They are being destroyed.Done by very, very bad people.Let us say Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays."There are too many people.Nashville, its wonderful  " you know, is that I can sort of be very current.AND FRANKLY, THE ONLY REASON I COULD WIN IS WE WON IN SUCH LANDSLIDES ALL OVER THE PLACE, INCLUDING IN INDIANA.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.And these are people that arent working for a paycheck.So I only like to say that because I love honesty.And I've met so many people.Yeah, I look forward to it.Thank you.That guy.What were trying to do  make America great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both militarily and we dont win anymore.Don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love.I mean, we know that for a fact.But they say "the young mastermind".Its called you get out.We dont need low-energy.Were not going to use the special interest guy  a donor.The wall behind me is very, very special.Dont worry about it.Its been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof.Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.But he said on one of  I think it was on Fox, he was being interviewed.Dont you think?I think this is the largest room.Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that.Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war.John, go ahead.Okay?I think theres 23 of them.And Ill say it and I know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say thats really  because Im a conservative, but Im a common-sense conservative.And we have those people.Theyd move from New Jersey to Texas.Well, I havent been working too much with the Arab leaders, to be honest with you.We tell them.I dont want it.We cant.We are doing well.Well, were going to stage something properly also.35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama.In fact, I feel a little bit foolish.You have a level piece of land.This is a movement.We did a great job with that company  Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA.Thats whats happening to our country and we cant let it happen.So he is the worst negotiator worldwide.We have people that arent smart.Theyve taken our money.Its unbelievable.This is evil.But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year  actually more than a year  we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially.The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.Shes horrible.Hes the one that did Bergdahl.We lose everything.Believe me.We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP OUR MAJORITY.Man, theres anger.We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico.Its under siege.And we will see what happen (sic).There is none.Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq.they had $140,000 left for the campaign.So I think you have a brand-new United States.I see it.Not going to happen that way.Now they’re all coming back.But the border by itself right now is doing very well.And they go into a room and, I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they’ve pulled off on you and on the public.Thats the question I like.Walker, nice guy, he went down.So I said were going to do this and I had no idea it was going to work this way.So I want to thank everybody for being here.We have tremendous people.But were leading New Hampshire big.LOOK AT THIS.Then you see what happened.One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757.Get out there and vote!Theyre not sending you (pointing to the audience).I love John Deere, too.I mean —

Q    (Inaudible.)And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved — weeks late, I have to say that.We got it.It was great.The bottom line on that  its such an interesting question.And its coming ...


With these people, folks, its coming.He was born in Canada.Its true.And the freeing of political prisoners.Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.We understand that.We get this horrible, dirty rotten spy  horrible traitor.It just doesnt work.Were going to get it.I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.I thought his father was a great guy.Maybe he was already that way.Everybody agrees  Democrat and Republican  everybody agrees the money should come back...trillion dollars outside of this country.I am.WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEIR MOTIVES ARE.We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.THE PRESIDENT:  Say, “Thank you, Mr. Trump.”  (Laughter.)Its a big industry.Because I cant be so nice and say "We can all do a wonderful job".Its never going to work.But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money thats their money because theres no way of bringing it in.I’d be a pretty good reporter — not as good as you.The love is unbelievable.Who got it?He’s the most brilliant lawyer.”  They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago.Theyre very, very capable children.What a great — where is she?You know what Sharia is.It’s always been a general or a politician.Thank you very much.But we’re stepping up now.In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.Now, you look like youre doing pretty well in all fairness.Think of it.We had a very, very big margin.You see, I know about deal-making.I want to thank my staff  both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what were doing currently, my staff where were running for the presidency.I dont know what the hell his problem is.Its all about that.BUT I CALL HIM THE FIVE-FOR-ONE.That’s not — this is going to be not good.And its a movement of intelligence, actually.Its against the law.I didnt know who did it.So, a friend of mine, so I call him, I say, "Youre actually doing that."I have nothing against China.You know, its called tomorrow night.They were in there for like $20 million.Its operating now.Now, I said you have to have a commitment to make it.But  and well see what happens.WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT.I was the same thing.Its like incredible.We have no idea.I mean, theres just a big bonding process going on.Look at this.To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs.We actually have a very good relationship together — a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations.Last week, Adam Scott won at the Trump National Doral.But with him...I always say, "Obama is the worst negotiator Ive ever seen."Remember this  they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money.Our biggest victories are still to come.You know, this isnt 68 years ago.Whoa.I used it, I talked about it at every stop.Big.THE PRESIDENT:  They would’ve given her time last week.Meaning somebody else is picking up...Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, "Truman loses" and he actually won.Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.Think about it.I dont know if I can make it.When they’re in trouble, they always pull out the racist word.Ford.We have to stop, and it has to stop now.Jeb  well, you know, Jebs got one problem.We would have gotten them back.I never liked it.You are unwilling and unable to accept the verdict issued at the ballot box during the great Election of 2016.They’ll soar.These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.I said before.Ill give you one good example.And that adds up to $5,600,000 total and were going to have some more coming in.But I guess it has been probably since 04.I think theyre using Komatsu from Japan...They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine whos Chinese from China  very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay?Very soon.We had a bad decision.But 17 instead youre not getting the people signed up.And one of these guys whos at two said, "He always talks about his polls and I dont."A $5 billion Web site.We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment.Vladimir Putin was on 60 Minutes with me three weeks ago.But the truth is that it stopped immediately.They dont even know what theyre there for.He says, "No, when you knock them out, theres no unfriendly decision."These people  and you know I have arguments with them all the time and Im a practical guy.At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country — (applause) — will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.Together, Republicans will lead America into our unbelievable future.Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details.They go around making it very difficult.And I told the story the other night for really the first real time.America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder.It’s — basically, they’re saying, “We don’t have any barriers.There was no collusion.Youve got to be able to win something.Our police are terrific.Your deductibles are going through the roof.These trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country.So, with that being said, we’ll take some questions and — yes, please.Im very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things.And its horrible.THE PRESIDENT:  I understand.Theres no leadership in Washington.He can stop things if theyre allowed to stop them.We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and admirals.(Applause.)(Applause.)And I ran.And we’re going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.Its not going to happen that way anymore.Then we said who it went to, then we said how much was it.I mean, a big chunk of the country is like that because were tired of stupidity.The good ones.These are people that have deceived us.You know what happened?And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen.So this guy was just getting beaten.The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.Most people dont even know what the agreement says.And he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support I have?We tried it President Obamas way, doesnt work.And this is my wheelhouse.We must...






... we must as a nation be more unpredictable.We have no choice.And they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of Republican primaries in terms of Iowa by far  not even close.Yeah.Q    Can I ask a follow-up?Nobodys tougher than me.But much more importantly, tomorrow, you get everybody you can and I promise you.But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.With me, thats easy.Its going to be fabulous.I DO WELL WITH COACHES.Well, in Europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming.We must keep freedom alive in our souls.I mean, Christians, evangelicals, weve done so well.And I’ll tell you, we’re spending a lot of money on the inner cities.We want them to use American steel.Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.You view democracy as your enemy!It’s going to be very big.They said "Donald Trump was disappointed".But I really appreciate you being here.Scum.I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and thats what it is, is a movement.Im the most conservative.What difference?Thats the end."That’s far back.Just so you understand.And I said for a period of time like a month, I said "I dont want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, Ive been on the top of the polls, almost at the top.I dont want them in our country.We protect Germany.They drew nothing, but now theyre drawing 24 million.Q    You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his government —

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.What is beautiful is when I was running against Jeb in New Hampshire.This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free.Were going to have our borders nice and strong.SO WHEN OUR ENEMIES LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR COUNTRY, THEY SEE OUR DEFICITS.And I wouldnt say it against our folks.THEY SAY BUT YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL.YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING SINCE BILL CLINTON SIGNED PROBABLY THE WORST DEAL ECONOMICALLY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, NAFTA.We just cant let it happen.They all said Im not running and I ran.I said, “Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?”  You were there, some of you.Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today.I mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond.And it came out that way — and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.Americans.The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.He called and spoke to, both ways — I think there were 30-some-odd countries.They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places.You know what Sharia is.We dont know who they are.People agree with what we've  they want the wall.It was good.But we sent them a little notice  dont use that term.Jeb  he lacks the quality that you need.(Applause.)Carl, do me a favor.THE PRESIDENT:  You don’t need it.And you know shes been involved in corruption her whole life, whether its Whitewater.Thank you!And it takes guts to run for president.Just blew up.We are going to make it strong.Those are the hedge fund folks that Ive been talking about for quite a while.Walker.Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.I have to do it."And I like China.Get rid of the fraud.That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.SO WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SAFE ZONES.What is going on?The fact is Im the only self-funder.But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.He looked at me, goes, "I  I hope youre kidding when you say that.We have third world countries that are ahead of us.Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax.We had such an amazing evening.The other day I got this great review.You know why?I mean, when Cruz runs, he runs.We have the best in the world.Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down.Have to do that.I like all the great builders.Its the craziest thing, right?Who are you with?Im under budget, Im ahead of schedule.You know who Beada is, right?For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.I don’t know if you’ve noticed.One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.So if the Democrats, who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now — the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me.And Im going to take care of our vets.Take a look at the deal hes making with Iran.I’m having a good time doing it.There's nothing wrong with that, right?It’s wrong.But today, it can take as long as a decade and much more than that — many, many stories where it takes 20 and 25 years just to get approvals to start construction of a fairly routine highway.And were getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons.I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities.Were going to be saying Merry Christmas again.Because its  its inconceivable.VERY IMPORTANT.Its actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and thats the end of that.You know, think about it.And this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going  were going to have problems.This could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was.Give me a question.I see there could be a number.All talk, no action, believe me.Say "You give our prisoners back or were not starting."So listen.(Applause.)Q    What do you — well, let me ask you this —

THE PRESIDENT:  Take a look at our federal prisons.Now, Im going to be spending.I mean, those are real numbers.(Laughter.)YOU KNOW, NOT A BIG DEAL.The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before.You have to run.I love this.Whats my statement?I always talk about trade.Now, I dont know that they do that.They know I was joking.WE'RE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.I hope to see you there.Because I was going to split the $1 million check up amongst...and in the end I just didnt want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups.No education.I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning.Nobody has done the job that we’ve ever done.And then the lies happened.Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?You want to put pipelines under our land you’re going to make the pipe in this country.Not going to happen anymore.They got complacent.Morning Joe held it up and he said, "Wow, those are great numbers."I get along great with Japan.I think beating Hillary Clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad.Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.With a hammer!IN FACT, THEY JUST TOLD ME, MR. TRUMP, SIR, YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF "TIME" MAGAZINE AGAIN THIS WEEK.Im a great president."Everybody said "Skip Iowa".Think of it.Because you know, do you ever see whats going on over there?But when Jerry was so strong and so great.Yeah.And they’re going to vote.Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us.Now, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up.Remember this.Q    It’s going to be good, sir.WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING.Right?And by the way, most of that money went out very early just so you understand.All right?I said that they are going to break away.I was a civilian.But I know you well enough.Its really not to be believed.Okay?But so I had a great experience.We give you seats.It was below zero.24 days.Under construction are many hypersonic missiles.No, I used to think they couldnt move.Japan  they send their cars by the millions.Just remember that.FOR THE KILLER, FOR THE KILLER.And you know what?I said, "What did you mean by that?"They said, "Oh, hes actually going to do it" because most of them said "Hell never do it."AND THE SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL IN MANY WAYS, BUT REALLY BAD IN OTHERS.A SMART GUY AND TOUGH.You saw that.We’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA.” (Applause.)Fords leaving.So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest.THE PRESIDENT:  You know what?Im telling you, folks, were being led by stupid people.So I think what will happen is, sadly, we’ll be sued, and sadly, it’ll go through a process.That’s how much divisiveness and other things there are.And look, I want clean air and I want clean water.They want to destroy our civilization, and hes worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax.MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN AT SOME OF THE ARENAS.And he said, "I got to go someplace else."I think it was a very tough call.I am asking you to choose greatness.Now, tomorrow you’ll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.Hes getting some free publicity.Very nice guy.And this is the system that our Founders wanted.They enslave women, and they murder gays.I went.And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.Thank you.And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled — right, Mike?Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.Youre going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs.We have 28,000 soldiers at the border.Im only kidding.After a full ...Actually I did a good job didnt I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said  I do what every other great businessman does.No, not at all.I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11.So nice.They took a big plant away from Tennessee  a great state  they took it away at the last moment.Yes, ma’am.Now, here’s the thing: If we make a deal, they won’t have to pay.Were going to be here so much youre going to get so sick of me.This was a very sad circumstance that happened with  I mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance.I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution — highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats — you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other.And were going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and theyre not coming back and I dont want to put them in our jails because I dont want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years.You look at all of the things that are bad--  I'll give you an example.No longer.Do you know that everybody said "Oh, Japan.Just concluded, as you know — two days ago, signed a deal with South Korea — a trade deal.And we have raised a lot of money.I said when did that happen exactly?Its not right.We won with Hispanics.We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.But you look at upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania.And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received.Theyre building in the South China Seas a massive military fort.But I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met.How many people have heard "The Snake"?I said, how could they keep selling it?General Odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember.And I say it, in the old days, theyd leave New York.Thats the negotiator we have.YOU KNOW, UNITED STATES, THEY SAID HAD NEVER LOST A WAR.So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that theyve wanted for many years.That seems to be the big story that were beating  they call it the establishment.(Applause.)Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.You know why?Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war.And now they're going to Texas and they're going all over.They have to work with us.Now, we have — hey, you know better than anybody — $700 billion and $716 billion.We don’t like bad news, right?Right?TODAY THEY ARE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT NOTHING.You know, weve bonded with the people whether its there or here.Its getting ridiculous.He is a lightweight, as Ive said many times before.THEY'RE MAKING PLENTY OF MONEY.And that’s okay — as per the United Nations.Look, folks, folks, folks, you know, you have to trust  there has to be some trust.But I say oh if I put a tax on these characters  these idiots.(Laughter.)He didn't know what he was doing.BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CALL UP -- GOOD MAN.I mean, that’s part of it.I throw it into a chapter.We want to do it right from here and from here and from here.All of this, and so much more, is possible.If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’  Well, son of a bitch.Thousands.And you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not youre going to make a deal.Thank you so much.Nobody even knows why.I would say about 99.9  is there anybody that doesnt re-negotiate deals in this room?Would anybody be surprised?So, were going to take care of that.But we also have some really bad gang members.THE DISHONEST MEDIA IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS.I mean, if she was, her face stayed the same.Before we begin, I’d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.Can you believe that?Its over.We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination.Its time.Can we have more?"They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasnt to build a bathroom.I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want.You have a big problem with discipline?But the people are so incredible that I've been saying make America great again and it's going to be greater than ever before.(Applause.)If you look at both sides — I think there’s blame on both sides.Everybody wants to build our wall.Theyll order parts that come in and theyll assemble them.I have Carl Icahn.There were 17.They didnt turn them in.You know, we started at nothing because nobody believed I was going to [run].Few can understand your pain.So they have the oil.You dont know the power that you have.This is a great feeling.She doesnt understand trade.Nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word.Caesars went bankrupt.Were going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobodys going to play with us.And hes very, very respected throughout the country but hes very respected here.You know, we get the biggest crowds.I mean, I want to be good.Were going to make our country so great again.Nabsico  home of the formerly wonderful Oreo which we dont eat anymore.You have daughters.Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years.And Chris Christie endorsed us.Ill tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president.This has not been my life turning down money.And hes not somebody that just do it.And I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics.Youre doing a phenomenal job.But I’ve known people for a long time.When I heard the poll today, they said "What are you going to do?"We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin.There are consequences.It’s already happening, but big league.(Laughter.)We are going to tear up and make great and very lucrative and everybody is going to be happy, including the other side, trade deals.And many, many of our most amazing military leaders, generals, admirals, amazing people, real fighters.YOU KNOW, WE'RE RUN OF THE HIGHEST TAXED NATIONS IN THE WORLD.It’s whatever you want to call it.Another couple of years, there wont be any jobs.I dont want them in our jails.(Applause.)And we're going to bring them back.Forty thousand.THE PRESIDENT: That was very professional and very good.Its a movement of common sense.Just say "Steve".We have an amazing country.Indiana's unemployment rate  and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family  Karen is amazing.Mr. President, please, we don’t need that much backing.Yeah, most people.Could be that we don’t work it out.We’ve learned a lot.You know that I had a totally innocent conversation with the President of Ukraine.And these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as theyre told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors.We will run it.Good wife?And I say, "What are we doing?But I see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber.It’s all a lie.But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.What are you getting?And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.Were going to make ourselves rich again.You know, we’re doing much better than I had projected in terms of — when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and we’re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.How do you get 45% when you have seven people?And what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were  we shot right up.This is something nobody can even understand.In recent years — (applause) — in recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three — it’s going to be great.A lot of fake.And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.Were going to have borders again.I had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally.We shouldnt have done it.They want it.Everybody agrees it should be brought back in.They’re giving the women a major chance to speak.We have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct.I don’t want them to have nuclear weapons.But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.The mainstream media  these people back here.I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.I made a speech outside.Bigger than any bank in this country by many times.So, Ukraine  lets take a few of these things and then Im getting the hell out of here; Im going back to New York.Im going to do great with Japan.They dont know where to begin.Thank you very much everybody.How do you spend $1 million doing a soccer field?Guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for Romney.And then they say "Trump goes bankrupt."Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.Why am I going to give them $1 million?Id like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us.Both of them want Trans-Pacific.WE'RE WINNING ON EDUCATION.I mean, you can be rich but you dont have to be stupid.Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didnt want his money and hes leaving.But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart.It’d be very dangerous.We want nothing to do with it.Its not going to happen anymore.The office is called VOICE — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.It is a disgrace whats going on.So remember that.But we do have a real establishment and theyve never seen this happen before.I’m proud of him.Im controlled by you.Maybe we wouldnt be here if it wasnt for them, to be honest with you.I can go — our general; I’ll have our general.Im never going to let you down.Have to do it.No, no.There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism.They were ignored by Washington.But she was Miss Wisconsin.They dont want her.Itd be a horrible thing to get rid of.THEY'VE REALLY RIGGED THE SYSTEM.Lets make the process complicated."And you're going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because Obamacare -- if you look -- look at the increases in your Obamacare.You know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right?Its a sieve.I could have asked every one of the group unlike Hillary who asks people to stand outside and say "Donald Trump didnt give the money."Its going to get worse and worse folks.Be very careful.Okay?We protect them.Our jobs have been taken away.I know there have been some super PACs  5 or 6 super PACs  where people are forming super PACs for Trump.They’re being thrown into prisons.But the Border Patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago.When Nabisco moves its plant from Chicago to Mexico, Im going to talk them out of it.And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy anywhere in the world.I have friends in Wisconsin.We have no choice.Were going to have a strong border, and I mean strong.Mostly false.So we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you.We have a lot of events scheduled, yes.That has to be the attitude our country has.And there’s a tremendous spirit.These people are living in hell.They’re not going to have old equipment much longer.I think it’s going to be a very, very important day in the history of our country.That cant be possible.China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.Just remember what I said.Some of the greatest assets in the world.AND REMEMBER THIS.This will include the countries in TPP, which are very important.(Applause.)They want it rebuilt.I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people, that’s for sure.His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who dont share its radical views.Another mess I inherited.It’s time that Washington heard your voice — and believe me, on November 8th, they heard your voice.They didn’t know the time.This is your day.Do it.But I’m not making anything near what they want to do.But I dont know.It got 10 feet higher.But why are we leading the fight?Please.What a job.I like you.So Im not going to say it because those guys will say "Well, he was wrong."We owe $19 trillion.They dont have it.Yes, go ahead.Then everybody starts to say, "You know, hes right."Because, look, Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people.I want the facts.We Are Going To Make America Great Again For Everyone  Greater Than Ever Before.They think were playing games.If we lower our taxes and we’re getting a massive tax reduction — and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially.Bill, good luck.THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, okay.Now, were going to keep things going and were going to keep things going very nicely but we owe  soon  $21 trillion.We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare.I think Im actually a very nice person."We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true.As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic.Its crazy.We have the power over China, economic power, and people dont understand it.Because I dont care...Each year the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East.We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.You dont reward behavior like that.Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese government.We have to build up our military.He doesn't build buildings.As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.Cant get it over there.One thing  one of the groups, it was actually CNN.A plant that you were going to have
[Comment on a supporters sign]
You know this is a movement, folks.A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.It's a scandal.The job he did was incredible.As an example, Hillary Clinton  no tough questions.He knew about it.Okay?And Im not a politician fighting, Im me.Were going to do very well in Ohio.He didnt give an answer as to exactly what hes going to do.Theyve taken our jobs.The Iowa is a much different kind of a thing.And she does not have the energy.Thats like a magic act.No, no, think of it.(Applause.)You know?I saved his life, and then he goes Hillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump.I drove here.I didnt know.He hated this and yet he said anybody could come.I SAID DO ME A FAVOR.Thats what I do....I started off on 17th.These are the stats."During the election, he left the race."I was told be nice to Paul Ryan because  really?I really believe he wants to get it done.Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give — they’re not giving classified information.HE'S A TOUGH GUY.We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.How are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?He said he never said it.Their numbers are down.It ends the death tax.Im going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste.And we need great trade deals and were going to make great trade deals.Ive been saying that for three years.But well take care of that.You saw the filings.Now, we have a very important election coming up.I wont bring anybody up.Thank you, everybody.Then I saw the tape.Whos better than me?Now, I would have done it differently.It just doesn’t work that way.I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again.But Im not happy.She said she’s going to bring back jobs, jobs, jobs.So for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incomingIn fact that was my first two weeks.No interest," because I dont need anybodys money.Let me give you the bad news.God bless you, everybody.Let’s just stop them.Do I think that its time for some of the other Republicans in the race that registering zero  in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which I assume is a mistake because thats less than zero.We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy — and I mean bloated — while protecting our national security.And I watch the speeches.But Ill do the fundraisers in the White House.Right?You dont know the power that you have.The House bill ends the Obamacare nightmare and gives healthcare decisions back to the states — and back to the American people.Im going on vacation", believe me, it doesnt get much worse than that.THE PRESIDENT:  China, now, put on $250 billion, and they’re paying 25 percent on that.So, they all say  then they go back home, after the debate.We're making a big speech tomorrow in Atlanta and then we're going right to Nevada.And it is hot in these rooms.First of all, congratulations to the Iowa State basketball team.So if you don’t mind, I would ask —

THE PRESIDENT:  I wouldn’t mind that at all.We see friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger.If you remember, I wasn’t going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting — I won’t go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.AND WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG.Whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, were going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like were babies.But they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million.And you are paying for it.The only problem we have is the size of the room  thousands of people outside trying to get in.You know, on a network that doesn’t like me very much — which is most of them — but a network that didn’t — doesn’t really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers.Ive employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.Thank you very much!Amazingly, theres a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC.And I had no idea that wed have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff Mitt Romney  a total stiff  who by the way hes a dope.That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years.Youre going to hopefully be around.Theyre taking so many of our companies.I mean, even if its true, you dont say it.Were so far behind.They don’t want the things that I have.And if I send it back, theres no letter I can write thats not going to be insulting to those people, really.Was she jailed?Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie.They said rich, you know, to say were going to make our country rich.You had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different but Russia is powerful so we could sort of say thats a balance.And theyre not bad.But more importantly, he choked.So when we started, I talked about trade.They dont even have a chance.How do you crack 50% when you have all these people running?Theyre going to be back, I guarantee you.When I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story.I don’t really know.You cant use it because the deductibility is so high.Did you ever see a guy like this?They’re screaming and I saw that.We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.You talk about a great franchise.(Applause.)SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE.Ready?You can check with Sean Hannity.They did not know if they would survive the hour.Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll?I supported him.So here I am  great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success.IT'S RIGGED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood.And we got it done.That’s where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.We have to get our prisoners back.I didnt get 30%.She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find.On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders — much of it you’ve covered — to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.No, what a lie  Katie Tur  what a lie it was from NBC to have written that.You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.Were going to make our economy incredible again.And theyre killing people.$2.5 billion, its going to be one of the largest in the world.They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries theyre representing.But did you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia?After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership now proven to be totally incompetent and corrupt, you have found NOTHING!But we’ve gotten rid of a lot of them.How are we doing?Everybody wanted it.Good guy.The next day, I watched ABC news.Youve never seen  Ive never gone bankrupt.You know, theyre doing everything.Im not going to hit him.Thank you!HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.Its really been  its really been great.But you know what?Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress.I was supposed to be Person of the Year on Time Magazine.When they say they want to run against me, that means they dont want to run against me, do you understand that?[Chris] Christie, by the way.Im in Washington."THEY LET HER GO.The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.Hard to believe.I just don’t have the time to speak to her.Think of it.These arent good jobs.And every hurting family can find healing and hope.If we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money?(Applause.)They said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds.We want the world to be  we want to bring peace to the world.That woman!We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.And we’re unable to compete with other nations.I just saw him.And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.It’s not like, oh, gee, it’s going to be wonderful in three years.We have — we’ll soon have a military like we’ve never had before.And you will never ever use them.So we should have kept the oil.WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.But I said, "You like me best."I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.I said to President Zelensky:  “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.”  I said do us a favor, not me, and our country, not a campaign.And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left.This one didnt like me.They dont like it.They want to see good health care.Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien.And they said it was a total lie.Id destroy him.But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation.They were, during the good oil days  now its probably half, which is fine.Hey, look at the campaign.Im angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with China.Okay?And it only makes common sense.Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, is a very large business, I will tell you that — Linda McMahon, a friend of mine.Some people think it’s much more than that.I think we did really well.This is not just a national security issue.After years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned  we cant fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently.DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.Maybe I shouldnt mention that particular bridge.Why cant we be unpredictable?Puts people in there  mastermind  bing, bing, bing, its like shooting everybody.93 million.And you know the reason I bring him up  I wouldnt even bring him up  but he spends a fortune on ads against me.Strong borders.(Applause.)Doctors are quitting the business.And she said "You will run but you actually have to go and run.And were not going to make deals like that anymore.Come here, Steve.We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.We cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries.And if we elected, we know that.Okay?THE PRESIDENT: Okay, fair question.Thats all she got.I said, "Let me ask you.So if I would have left a couple of days early, I think I would have won Florida the same.We have to be tough.Believe me."Are you doing nuclear weapons over there?"I read where a washer  you know what a washer is?But it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great.Great deal maker.Do you understand that?But they said "If we dont have to, lets not."And we have to know about it.I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT.And then Bush  Jeb.Now hes at zero.I dont like dishonesty.Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlandos LGBT community.Perhaps itll go down  and Ive been pretty good at predicting things.And we arent supposed to call them or anything.Theyre political hacks.And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave "reviews"there was very little criticism.AND OVER THE YEARS, I THINK I LEARNED THAT.Wouldnt you love that?And he said, "Youre going to win.I mean, Hillary.Somebody else would have it, probably maybe Iraq because he would have come back.Today I heard it.That's the kind of potential we have.Its got to be fair.And it’s a very, very important process to me, and it’s a very important statement.We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see whats happening.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.And she’s angry for even suggesting it.Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example.Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.Because like tomorrow night were having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate.We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great.We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety.But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.I might have filed if I wasnt going to run.It just went beautifully — right through the roof.How crazy are we?This year.Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.But they’ll take this news conference — don’t forget that’s the way I won.And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.Q    Can you tell us how you’re feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon?Me, Im going to do the right thing.They know Ill do great with China.That’s where we were heading.And I think it will be an amazing boon."Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy.I looked at the biggest boats youve ever seen.We’re going to fix it.There are so many great things we can do on health care.They've taken our jobs, they've taken our money, they've taken everything.He didnt even know.Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.I know many of them.People were shocked, Trump got it.They are yearning for help.Anybody I forgot?We dont know if theyre Syrians.As an example, why didn’t they take care of Yemen in the deal?You know, it used to be theyd move from New York to Florida.But I want to get the automobile industry to build factories here.They want to change your religion.Im sorry.AUDIENCE:  USA!I didnt expect to do so well.He wants to give give me probably close to $10 million.We’re also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against Communist oppression.We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.Were going to bring our jobs back from South America."Well, will they show up to vote?"We have to be vigilant.They moved them all the way south  all the way south  and they didnt come back.The border city of El Paso, Texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities.I mean people were writing, "How are Mr. Trumps hands?"We can save our country.I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around.We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico.I wanted to say, "Walk."A very special man and president.And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.Yes, go ahead.You know.Can I read this to you?Look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote.What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else.There’s no reason why we shouldn’t.He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets.I watched New Yorkers rebuild the World Trade Center.Q On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?I appreciate it.Five deep and long.The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.Now theyre coming at us in full force.Were going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs.Are we babies?(Applause.)This is the time to reignite the American imagination.Not anymore.We’ve got enough problems.And also, we’ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.She has it completely backwards.Thank you very much.So we will get that straightened out.I have to win.Its healthy.Terrific.Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.So they come to my office.Now, could they start up again?So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.I would like to go — yes, go ahead.Right to do oil.So, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared.When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders.Isnt it crazy?If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice.We have to help the people with the migration.When we can.We’re not talking about the balls, or we’re not talking about even the speeches — although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday.Pretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War.I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no.You know, I won Arizona very big, and Sheriff Joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it.And we were talking border security, which were just doing so great with the border security.Like Senator Dan Coates whose there — one of the most respected men of the Senate — he can’t get approved.Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.And you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me.He got in there, he said, "I shouldnt have done this.WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO IT.And they do it with guile.And we will take care of our great veterans.You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain.I mean, take a look at me.The donor now is Carl Icahn.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.And all of you know Trump National Doral and we’ll go there.The Boston bombers came here through political asylum.We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty.Im going to do it.The trade deals are wonderful.Hopefully its he in this case.He’s like this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right?Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%.That was one of your platforms during your campaign.I knew it from the other side.But there was a cameraman that was in front of it.I do The Apprentice.Because I won in a landslide.A lot of you dont know we protect Germany.I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing.$50 million or more.This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.And actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built.We vet the vets.Hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, theyre closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour.And yes, we will build a wall.AND YOU KNOW WHAT?Q I’m sure you checked that out, sir.THE PRESIDENT:  — and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win.Thank you.Q    And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?Gentlemen, we salute you.So they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind.To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.Shes being protected.It’s been something that’s really been very special.And I got it and were building this phenomenal hotel  Trump International Hotel  right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House.This was  in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three.And I said very strongly exactly what happened.Believe me, they didn’t come from me.And for that reason, I have signed the pledge.He said, "Even if you dont win, what youve done is incredible; youve totally changed the landscape of politics."Its caused by a doctors medical negligence.Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don’t know.I hate to hear it."Thats what going to happen.You see it with Jamiel.We got a bad decision.I love the people.And were going to hand them out right now to the press.(Applause.)So when you think of it  and then they say youll never be able to build a wall.They see it’s not fair.And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, its selling like hotcakes.She is a very good person and she’s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign.What does that mean?Right?Go out and vote tomorrow.Everybody left.She gave all the valuable uranium away.Its true.And you understand it.Shes on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about Trump University.And maybe thats not a perfect conservative view, but I can tell you one thing.Everybody  even my enemies  said "Trump is going to win."Ive been watching politicians now for years  all talk, no action politicians.She has a great husband, Jared, and Ill tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and shes very proud.BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CALL HIM AND YOU COULD EITHER SAY, GOVERNOR, OR VICE PRESIDENT, SIR, PLEASE, PLEASE SPEAK TO MR. TRUMP.Thank you, Ann.I have as big a heart as anybody.One by one — you’re reading about it, right?It’s wrong.Caesars filed Chapter 11.I want a lot of things.Q So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are —

THE PRESIDENT: Who did I say is not good?Boy, he is bad.I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer."We will have all troops out.Well, they couldnt find it because what have they done thats good?So the enemy all of sudden said, "Wow", cause dont believe it.See?...Youve been paying into Social Security and Medicare, by the way.They told me — without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they’ve become used to it — that it’s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.So Sarah, I mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but I am a truth-teller and I will tell the truth, OK?Our country cannot do without steel.ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran.And then I see this story on CNN last night.Theyve done an incredible job and everybody goes through Liberty.What youve done is incredible."(Laughter.)He’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim.I love the people.So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big.Veteran:
Thank you, Mr. Trump.We’ve detained more people.Guys that study NATO and good people but they study NATO and they say, "I dont believe it.He said terrible things about her.And every place were speaking, if we have 10,000 people its like a small group.I SAID, WELL THEN I BETTER BUILD IT BIG AND BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT.And somebody would say thats profiling.We had a certain  same event  it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people.Were going to find ourselves a PattonBut were going to find a Patton and were going to find a MacArthur.And your Senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you.So, Paris, why don’t we start with you?I build infrastructure.And our great members of Commerce [Congress], I want to thank you all for coming.We are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it.The citizens of Texas and the Gulf Coast need all the prayers, support, and resources our communities have to offer.The process has begun from day one.Theyre not stupid.I promise I will defend you from profiling.We have to admit, still the New York Times.And the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly.Since my election, we’ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially.We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager.Because were getting rid of ISIS.These Departments refused to comply.Yes, ma’am, go ahead.The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election.But Bill Kristol  Ive been watching this for two years.If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I dont think its anybodys business if I want to send money to the vets.Okay?Q    Okay.Look at her face.There was not even  nobody even there!Im more militaristic than him.Its coming from more than Mexico.He's very tough.I just saw where for the last week shes been hitting me really hard with the women card, OK?The world is a different place.I dont like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody.Here’s another beauty.Folks, you cant straighten out this mess  were in a mess  if you cant do what you have to do.And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.I dont do anything.I brought it.(Applause.)“Okay, I’ll answer this one.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim.One hundred percent.Theyre very good.It’s patriotic Americans like you who make this country run, and run well.Right?But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month.It’s a disaster.I want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it.And now I hear they want to negotiate to get  and what do they say?Because the people the people know.If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISISs ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.And our leaders arent smart enough to stop it, okay?We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.You have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and I wont forget it.You want to get your schools better, you better get rid of Common Core fast.And they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint.They make all the television  other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit.And she looks magnificent.So let’s also talk about a place called Venezuela.And most importantly, all of the things that you’ve been hearing about –the horror stories — in my opinion, they’re gone.Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our countrythey enslave women, and murder gays.YOU LEAVE, YOU KEEP THE OIL.Nobody knows.Americas Vetdogs  The Veterans K-9 Corps Inc.  $75,000.25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%.We lose on everything.And I called my people and I said, "How can we win?They self-inspect.But people  one of the reasons they say Im doing so well because I let people know were going to bring jobs back.And are you coming along okay?I say fan the crowd just to show  look at all the people over here.We have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people.(Applause.)I would have made  poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy.You look at Ben and hes very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare.Somebody is making a fortune.We should have the Gulf states  Saudi Arabia and these states they are not spending.Its disgusting.In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning.They said, "No.Time Magazine -- Time Magazine last year did an incredible cover story.And I was the elite.I have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money.But weve got to start thinking.Theyre contributing to every candidate but Trump.Were going to win with our Second Amendment.There were things given.And were gonna be there very soon.BUT THE COACHES LIKE ME.But I will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you its 30%, 32%.Theyre going to built a plant, $2.5 billion in Mexico.You know who’s great now?But Im not going to have anything happen in Wisconsin.You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window.And we had a great transition.When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation.I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.The audience is young.Mark is saying "What are the top threats to your candidacy?"You had Camp David in 2000, where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous.No matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home.ISIS  ISIS was two.I wouldnt even names.Were going to absolutely do the right thing.Youll probably say, "We cant give  the caucus, just forget it.Its a real establishment.Q    George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.Stand up.The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.From their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more  six, seven, eight days.And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times — I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times.IT WAS SO DISGUSTING.Its now less than a year and you know we have the Iowa starts on February 1st and then we go right down the line and its very exciting.I mean, everything I say he agrees with me.He said, "We are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that weve been in in decades."Q Fixing the inner cities.Expected to go for another four years.We all know it.51%.IT'S SO IMPORTANT.But she committed a crime in my opinion.You know Obama, as you know he said it wont happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started.After Secretary Clintons failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans.We need regulations, but many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.Honestly, its horrible.But she says she doesnt like him.It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.WE'RE STOPPING DRUGS FROM POURING IN.Dont worry about it.Yeah, sit down everybody.We’re going home.There’s nobody I respect more.Who?(Applause.)They look at me, and they can’t even answer it, because there’s no answer.And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany.Great guy.A lot of people think it’s $506 billion.And they said, "Well, hell never ever put in his financials."So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.Youre in the White House.(Applause.)If it does get in, you have to pay a big tax.You see what we’re doing with our military — bigger, better, stronger than ever before.WE WENT IN, SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.Honestly.We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 21 percent.Some of them are worth more than a billion.MR. SCHWAB: — who tremendously contributed to the discussions the last (inaudible).So a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff.In another words, theyre doubling down.Victory is not winning for our party.THEY CAN'T GET PARTS.Right now, the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province.Good.Look, hes been perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States.Who is he?"And all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, we appreciate it very much.And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now.Im not going to forget it.If we can win in South Carolina, were going to go  I mean, we could very well run the table.Show how beautiful your girl was.So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.Were going to build a wall thats going to be a real wall.Were going to go to Florida, were going to spend so much time in Florida.Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.They cant get their money back.Im the one that had the tape.When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured.I LOVE YOU INDIANA.And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message.As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.Its bad for  all of this illegal immigration.We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.See, I would have gotten rid of these columns, actually.Horrible.But they are not blue-collar.And they dont want it because their farmers dont want our beef.THE PRESIDENT:  That sounds so good.HE JUST KNEW IT WAS BAD.He loves me.What’s happening with the United States?Because were down the line and the fact that you cant win as independent.I see Rubio on the ads all day long.I say, "Wait a minute.They have the largest number of murders that they’ve ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders.So we have a lot of problems.Are you not running?No, no.She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads.All needless, job-killing regulations will be immediately canceled.It’s a lot of people.Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, theyre going to Ireland.African-American people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers.Who did it go to?"I have so many  I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me.So we have to fight for the Second Amendment.Right?Im totally accountable but I didnt want to have credit for it.And yet — it’ll be the greatest cut, I believe, in the history of our country.I agree with that.They were rigged.They didn’t want to say that.And then theres ISIS.They said, "How are you going to get them to pay?"I know what was said.Right?Right?Weve got to build a wall.And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to — you know, they did a great job.So nice, thank you very much.I think Marco is highly overrated.How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?"Dont watch it.I hate to give it up.We are run by people that are so bad, theyre so out of their league  and I see it, I see it on the stage.I like it better than Univision.Nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office, the Washington Post published a story headlined, “The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.”  Less than three months after my inauguration, Representative Maxine Waters stated, “I’m going to fight every day until he’s impeached.”  House Democrats introduced the first impeachment resolution against me within months of my inauguration, for what will be regarded as one of our country’s best decisions, the firing of James Comey (see Inspector General Reports)—who the world now knows is one of the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen.He really didn’t think — it was really what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong.Thank you very much.And Ive been saying that for a long time.We’ve delayed it a long time.Don’t forget, it’s not like I’ve done this for — a senator came into my office and said, “Sir, I’ve been running for office for 30 years.And then theyd come in, "Sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week."I said, "I dont know."But, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me.You know, one of the things that makes me happy.Weve got to close the deal.Very, very true.They all know it.Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.To the best of my knowledge, theres a lot of oil in Texas.And what do they do with the money?And who else won on The Apprentice?Im self-funding.Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.I dont think theyre going to be doing it.But Mike was literally — I had a group of — what, we had nine different people?Youre going to see what were going to do.So it really does  and more than anything else, its also speaking to other veterans.Look, Im fighting some very nice people.Thank you.WE SEND THEM BEEF.(Applause.)We lost of thousands of lives.Number two, Im a private company, so nobody knows what Im worth.You’re going to be surprised to hear that.What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.Were going to be the smart people again.So, weve got a long way to go.I want nothing.You need eminent domain.Okay?Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and Ill tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets.Its not like you have the Republicans here and you have  everybody agrees.Its very simple.Just remember.Thank you very much.AND I COULD SEE IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING.First of all, youre amazing people.And the jobs we have now are bad jobs.I just think  you know, I came up with the energy.Right?Theyre 40 years old.Cory, good job, Cory.Everybody wins except us.Theyll say "No".But their leaders are killing us on the border and theyre killing us on trade.Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.Right?I was saying if they would work, if they would have worked so hard, so diligently against President Barack Hussein Obama, they would have beaten him.So, were going to build a wall and Mexicos going to pay for the wall, believe me.Now theyre all going, "Wow" because they see whats happening.They really have been very fair.Well go ahead.People can’t believe it.You know?Right.It’s just a lie.You know, it’ll be a whole different story.I went to the best business school in the world.As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly shared prosperity and rewards to those who play by the rules.Our country has no spirit.And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.Everybodys writing about it all over Europe, all over the world theyre talking about it.Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security.THE PRESIDENT:  That’s a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control.Over a billion dollars.I am not happy about that.Okay?He's tough.Do not take our country down with your party.It is going to be amazingly destructive.I guarantee.Were going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:


"When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, theyre not sending their best.I said, “Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country.Its not going to happen.Ted Cruz wants TPP and it is going to make NAFTA look like peanuts.I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud.So remember that.Take me in for heavens sake.Okay?"Together, we will put the American people first again.But in looking at these situations--  I built an incredible company.I mean, I see hats  theyre like helmets.20 YEARS AGO, IT WAS BANG, BUT SLOWLY.Go ahead.$1 million on a soccer field.Am I nervous?He’s doing the right thing.”  And, you know, a lot of people — it’s a complex game.I dont want to talk about that.It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best.The tone is such hatred.I was the one that said it first, and I mean it.From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, youre talking about millions and millions of returns.So we write about it in the book.Were going to put America back to work.And I watch these guys — Little Adam Schiff, and all of the guys.I was getting these little polls.And Fox  every two minutes its a commercial on Trump.Special.Welcome.And I said it yesterday — it has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth.Let me be clear.She just gives me a headache.And you know what well do?So I want to tell you this story.And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.We want to build safe zones in Syria.So I dont like that.So nice.We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obamas line in the sand in Syria.They dont want to be killed.Very fair story.The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.I mean, we’re probably 50 percent done.Im at 30%.We also need to bring back in this country  because we see what happened  our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs.Its coming from more than Mexico.Remember when we left, I was opposed to going in because I said youre going to destabilize the Middle East.And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that.When you look at whats happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in.THE PRESIDENT: I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.” I don’t have to do that.But you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups.Q    We’re — we’re kind of, uh —

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, we’ll do you after that.Now, shes gotten millions of dollars.In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.$24 trillion.I want to thank my family.But if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldnt you start screaming or something?Ill tell you what.My Jeb impression?When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people.They come as an act of love?"When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.And you know, these are amazing states and were going to probably get a lot more.I had no choice.Walls work if its properly constructed.“Not well, not well.” Why?But I take great care  education and health care  and my people are very happy.But its a very personal story.I was on the ground in Texas yesterday to meet with Governor Abbott — who is doing, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.They gave us a tremendous send-off.But I will say that they said — it was very interesting — that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King.And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.You know, we are bombing.It can happen.We’re going to support the amazing — absolutely amazing men and women of law enforcement.But I only like polls that treat me well.(Laughter.)I don’t know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out.Thank you.And it’s not easy, I want to tell you.And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually — it wasn’t a setup.Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again.They used to move from New York to Florida, or theyd move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris.It's an incredible movement with incredible people.The toughest gun laws in the world, they have it in Paris.Theyre not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody.Were going to take this system apart.THE PRESIDENT:  Right.We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.Don’t sit yet.And always so theatrical; Mr. Trump said this and that and this.And we made a deal — paid — like, in a short period of time.I actually called.Come on.And you brought up, actually, that you support a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis there.They are so dishonest.But I said, itll take six months.The public has a right to know how these people got here.In Spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the Grand Marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state.Oh, stand up.Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.But its $125 million.(Applause.)I live in Manhattan.Its like theyre the Bobbsey twins.Look, I went through Congress.I want people with great talent to come into the United States.Go ahead, please ...






M. TRUMP: Just want to say an amazing place -- South Carolina.That's a great thing.MY DEFINITION OF "TRADE" IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE GREAT DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.AND SOME OF THE FOLKS, I SAW ONE YESTERDAY, I WILL NOT EVEN MENTION NAMES BECAUSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY, RIGHT.And he waits.I want ISIS to surrender.I saw it with the Romney campaign.And you could get them to stop just by saying "Were not doing business with you anymore."He gave a certain date, and the enemy said, "It cant be possible.There is no second place because were so high, so much  you have China, you have Norway, you have Denmark, you have Sweden.And your whole group, these are really special, amazing people.Its something that has maybe never happened and theyre saying its phenomenon.WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA.You have to be able to lead.Achilles International  great organization  $200,000.I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.We have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year.The worst.Look, were losing our jobs.And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well.Were taking away deductions and thats one of the reasons were able to lower it.There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.And it will be very interesting.But I do.For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back.You completely failed with the Mueller report because there was nothing to find, so you decided to take the next hoax that came along, the phone call with Ukraine—even though it was a perfect call.He’s a horrible human being.We have great stuff.Scott Pelley interviewed me.It’s a very simple.We’re doing very well.It has to make us safer as a nation.Thats what it draws.Our rules and regulations are horrible.And they just said it.I mean, maybe its not working but its better than Jeb right?"Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet.We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.I appreciate it.Theyve never seen anything like it.And honestly, I use Mexico as an example because theyre so tough.We were doing it together.We’ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines — thousands and thousands of jobs — and put new “Buy American” measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.Do you mind if I said it?"They haven’t gone up for a long time.Now, the same thing a few days ago in California.Not complicated.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.Were all watching.And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration.We will make our country strong again.But just yesterday, Obama just yesterday he brought it up that hes very unhappy.If its windy, if its hot  everything is extreme.Oh, so complicated.We’re going to have a great eight years together.And even today they just announced many more.Now, right after the program that were talking about  and I thought it was clear, but you know, were talking about groups, groups, groups.Nancy knows it.The world is blowing up, the migration in Syria  they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to Syria, and the whole worlds talking about it.WE'RE GOING REMEMBER THAT THEY DO A FABULOUS JOB.Q    Senator McCain defined them as the same group —

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at — excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?Right?I will say that.(Applause.)The all-time.And I am going to try — I will do everything within my power to fix that.(Applause.)And I dont know.The last thing she wants in her whole life is  this was only  I did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husbands one of the great abusers of the world?Its not like very important to me anymore.What does it mean?It was like this  "Here, Hillary, hit this one out of the park."So we have 50 million  almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and its got to end.And how about the woman?If she doesnt become president, she could have a real problem.Ill tell you something.We are going to help your country.Okay?I said, “What a deal.”  It took like a week.We owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount  $1.4 trillion.Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that.Never again.People flow over.We get the drugs.And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.Im a Presbyterian.Thank you, all, very much.And Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Administration is working just fine.The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems — or she — or she.Now, I said it for economic reasons.We call them.You saw it in Paris.He’s embarrassed.Oh, hes not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and were very happy about that.Theyre like gamblers.Secondly, we will totally dismantle Irans global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that — some other lightweight — he was probably told — he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.Q Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.But were doing well.The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters.THANK YOU.Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests.Do you have a comment?Were going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before.SO I KNOW ABOUT THAT.And I said, "$1 million for what?We have to have a strong military.There is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens.HOW ABOUT YEMEN.Hillary said the same thing.I do the building and then do the rendering.We are laughed at by the rest of the world.Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.It was Sharon.and they said, "Just Second Amendment.Beada, where are you Beada?Chuck knows it.And youre going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the United States?And hes got a great future.We see it.We have great respect for you.I just got the best hotel in North America.Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened.They have 24 days for inspection period.And Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed me.Youre going to go home and youre going to remember this.Great to be back in New York with all of our friends, and some great friends outside the building, I must tell you.So important.I dont think Id take it if we had two people but I think Id take if we had three.Theyve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.But I’m sticking up for the people.We talk about amendments.Okay?And they’re going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs.”  But I think we can call them terrorists.SPEECH 7: Donald Trump Speech in Miami - Sept. 16, 2016

Welcome to all of you deplorables.THE PRESIDENT: Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.Q    And he called on it again, linking —

THE PRESIDENT:  Senator McCain?THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.I love you all.It blew up.But they were hacked, and terrible things came.How does it happen?If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, thats a lot of money.And if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences.Good evening.I didnt say that.Not for a long time.(Laughter.)She wouldn’t know where to begin.I dont think so.Mr. President, I want to —

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.Ive toured so many of the states.And importantly, shes on tape saying how great it is.Thats all it is.They spend money.Thank you all for doing a really incredible and creative job on what we’re going to be discussing today, which is infrastructure.And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike.And then he goes again.I mean like number one by many, many times.Wouldnt be worth it.The one thing I have to say and I have to ask you to do, go out and vote.I just dont know whats going to happen because I dont know whether or not the Democrats are going to protect her.Not just a Supreme Court judge, I’m talking about court of appeals; I’m talking about district court.Q Thank you, Mr. President.And we need borders and were going to have borders.I agree.Hes one of the  biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didnt read it....I really do.We give them practically nothing.[U.S.A. chant]

It’s time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.But  so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and thats the beginning.Q    (Inaudible.)Were going to make it so good.You look at schools.These politicians  are they really that dumb?"And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well.Shouldnt have been there.We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people  with force, purpose and determination.We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.Were going to give you the names right now, which is what you want.THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN REDUCED TO.Were ready to start shooting."Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website.I mean, she goes along with everything.Theres nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him."They cant find jobs.We shouldnt be saying it.I said, “This is the biggest story.I mean, the leaders are too smart for our people.Well have plenty  well talk a lot about ISIS.Heres the story.Because I'm an outsider.Dont worry about it.AND I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER ENTER A BICYCLE RACE WHEN I'M IN THE MIDST OF AN IMPORTANT NUCLEAR NEGOTIATION, I PROMISE.Were going to take.Some of you know it.As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist

same thing.You know, they never report it.Thats common sense.I REALLY MEAN THIS.Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal.What they’ve done to this family, what they’ve done to these children — these beautiful children of his — and what they’ve done to his wife.Many of them are reluctant to come forward.Now I know some people say Im too much of a fighter.But we’re starting to build them again.And I’ve done a job.(Applause.)On receiving this news, Megan’s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious

Thank you.In late 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City, and on Washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims.And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.We cant be.Its not a friend to freedom.So what did we get  $2 trillion.I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.Thank you very much.Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad.Ill tell you thats an amazing and just an incredible story and were going to make sure that it goes as well as it can.You know, two days ago I was greatly honored because the Border Patrol, the folks that do a great job, and theyre told to stand back but they dont want to stand back.If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers.Were not going to let companies leave.They would have said

going to have a baby.I guarantee no other person gave John Deere  I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments.You know, its very hard.And once this is done, and a

to.He was incredible.Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly.The drugs come in.But the fact is, we are just getting started.Stand up Mr. Cook.They do at will.They’re doing it for other people.Ive been here many times.RICHARD PETTY.We failed to develop a new vision for a new time.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her iPhones — with a hammer!It is a loss.Its a disaster.They control the mayor’s offices, the school boards, the city councils and the seats in Congress.I mean, were not going to let it.They cant even answer simple questions.All right, I love you.Oh, I wonder why.Wait until you see what’s coming, folks.Okay?We have losers.I cant even talk about it.You know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how were the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they dont respect us and they dont take care of us and they dont treat us right in many cases.Now, the Muslim community, so important.Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.We are also securing our immigration system, as a matter of both national and economic security.And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it.This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I dont spend any money of the taxpayers.And the other thing: Chaos.Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world.Does that make any sense to anybody?It wont be that way for long.I said, "What would you call it?"We had a very good talk, especially the second one — lasted for a pretty long period of time.With the Republicans its less obvious.I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.THE PRESIDENT: Not good.You know, they go to Washington  "Were going to stop Obamacare.Okay?(Applause.)Theyre totally dishonest people.We have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails.They didn’t know the year.Unemployment rate  well, they say  that cant be possible.It could even be before I'm finished but it's -- but she insisted on being here.(Applause.)And they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith.AUDIENCE:  USA!But theyre very nice people.The traffic, it’ll be coming our way.See?We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.USA!How much longer is it going to last?Everybody can be c-- This plan is just a basic disaster.Just too many things that I watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made  Bergdahl  where we get Bergdahl and they get five killers.(Laughter.)(Applause.)And at this moment, the answer is absolutely not.We want

tremendous amount on would be sending the military.Okay?A dummy.I have thousands of employees.I want to protect our citizens  all of our citizens.Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the

dinner together with their families.Okay?Were in the real world.We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in.Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.No, its true.Now, I look at this U.S. manufacturing  I mean, just look at this.Thats correct.A tremendous reputation.(Applause.)They’ll make it impossible through regulations for our product to be sold in their country, and yet they’ll sell their product routinely in our country.We should work  thank you.And we didnt do it.By the way, they’ve started buying again.No vision.And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President.Tough cookie.Youre a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.It’s a big con game.One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues.Weve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that weve never seen before in the history of our country.The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.We say "were gonna protect."And so finally I said, "Look, lets  were going to do it.Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING.And thats what theyre doing.We

interesting.(Applause.)We love it.Ive said NATO need to change its focus and stop terrorism.And then he said, "Oh, I misspoke."And then we had a case in Los Angeles where it was in California where the 14 young people were killed.We have to be strong."How does it feel?How about we do it right now?(Applause.)Its been an amazing thing.And if were not, were not going to have a country.Then I get people screaming at me.Why does he have to tell  first of all, it doesnt even sound good when you say "50 soldiers" because it sounds like so small.You know what I want to do?Under our deal, it’s not going to happen anymore.We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be  and  and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.I would think that you would personally be appalled by these revelations, because in your press conference the day you announced impeachment, you tied the impeachment effort directly to the completely discredited Russia Hoax, declaring twice that “all roads

THE PRESIDENT: Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism.And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s — I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion.Were leading in every poll.It's not working.But we’ve done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment.Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.I didn’t know him.Okay?The Obama administration.Thank you.Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal.They build ramps.I mean, look at this.We let people go out of Gitmo and they kill Americans.I dont take their money.Its a total imbalance."We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.The strategy of our economic rivals has worked.And I didnt have to do that.But I saved this article.We will end up getting healthcare.Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.Thank you.We dont have the support.Right?Thank you.Im down in some.Way under budget.To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade.Then I would have doubled up the sanctions.We want  they charge us rent?Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last week at a public forum that your party’s impeachment effort has been going on for “two and a half years,” long before you ever heard about a phone call with Ukraine.We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.But there’s a tremendous spirit in the United States.No tax, no nothing."In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid.Who does Mr. Trump think he is?THE PRESIDENT:  Great people.I feel good with them.I did see a reporter last night — a guy I like, personally, a lot.And that’s just the beginning.The next day, were watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart.Our president doesnt have a clue.I see it.So go back.China sends in massive excavators and theyre (inaudible).The judge has been very unfair.Theres no "Hello.Theyre crooked.Because those cameras stay right in your face and I think they cant move.Its like the other day  Ivanka, shes doing so great.Big poll.AND I PUT UP MILLIONS.And every single thing were going to win, win, win.And you know, in theory you could say "Well, maybe its not my thing."They have no respect for human life.Okay?Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.America First.So we give them $150 billion and theyre not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.You’re going to have nobody.But he became radicalized quickly.Billions and billions of dollars.I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him....By the way, the Sheriff is here and hes a great guy and his people are fantastic.Thank you, Governor.And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.Turned out to be a total lie.One hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals.And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.So thank you all very much.AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, PROBLEMS WILL HAPPEN.A couple of more.It’s a big job, and it’s a job that’s not only housing, it’s mind and spirit, right, Ben?See Club for Growth.But were going to come very close.If you look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they’re unhappy when it’s seven, eight, nine.I dont know why I didnt think of it sooner.But before I —

Q    (Inaudible.)But the facts are on Bushs side and ultimately I think Marcos going to be hurt very badly....My sons are really great marksmen.And he said, “Because it was too complicated.”  Well, you just gave all your cards.No.We sell the beef and it goes over there and its very perishable.And he tells me a little bit about Club for Growth and Im falling asleep.And were winning by almost 300 delegates.We’ll do it.Okay?In fact, a lot of the event didn’t even happen yet, as we were speaking.Our politicians dont know  they dont know."No, no, no, you have to  nobody doesnt take a renewal.For every one percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs.Its beautiful whats happening.And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington."They understood we have to do it.And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to, time and again, side with the accused and not the accuser.In the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment theyll be saying "Okay, its a good thing" because theyll be beneficiaries also.Q    Yes, Mr. President.Now is time for a new Republican administration, working with our Republican Congress, to pass the next great infrastructure bill.Same with China.We’ve had a great three days at the United Nations in New York.And then you wonder why theres crimes in our cities.Youve got to look at some of the statements from the past.I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world.Thank you, Blaine.But this is just an unbelievable woman.Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first.Q    — right, how have those —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.You know, 42% with like 14 people thats pretty good.I’m not ranting and raving.SUCH NICE PEOPLE.Watch, you just watch...Were going to take care of it, and its going to be done in a very humane way.Could we maybe just go around the room and we’ll introduce ourselves.Look at Congressman Nadler’s challenger.Not quite, right?Hes a horrible negotiator.It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.The dumping was horrible.Incredible guy.You look at what China's doing to us, what Japan does to us, what Mexico is just killing us at the border -- at the border and with trade.You know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago.No, I want to take that thinking to the White House.Im going to spend money here.But he said very nice things.You lose $500 billion a year with China.IT JUST CAME OUT.I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different.Your deductible is so high.Then theyd fight, fight, fight for years and years and years.They will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power.Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat.Thank you.I like him.But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.Thats not going to happen with me.And youre talking about one company I know of  I dont know how much theyve written about it  but youre talking about 6,000 jobs just one company.But youre going to be hopefully around.As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism.Were leading in Texas.I want to bring tremendous wealth into this country.Elvin says that, “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve [really] done my job.”  Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.Remember I said "Take the oil"?LOOK, HERE IS THE STORY.I mean, theyre like stupid.I HATED, I HATED WATCHING IT.They got tired.But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.Honestly, we just went over that.We cant be.Beautiful.BECAUSE I AM IN FAVOR OF FREE TRADE.Its been pretty tough.Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.Its a ramp  a little ramp that goes over the wall.See now Im a politician.They have no plan now."But it’ll probably or possibly be just “USM.”  It’ll be United States and Mexico.You know, when Ive got a big audience.Thank you.Were doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable — and irredeemable!AND HE'S ACTUALLY A QUALITY PERSON.But, you know, I started and I started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%.So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer.Sergeant Bergdahl, all right?And were going to use  we have the best.I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost.Im going to be good for womens health issues.Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.And it's not that she believes in it.Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small  and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did.The only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester.We have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted.We shouldnt have done Iraq.We got some bad ones.One person.You know, everythings so dramatic.They dont want people pouring in.And it was virtually more than doubled.And they’re raising them because we’re doing so well.And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.No, thanks.(Applause.)Youd go to South Carolina.So far, I think I’m batting about 100 percent.The polls have been incredible.Just one little outlier here.No, we’re on the right side.Q    But you’re saying why (inaudible) —

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.I think maybe hes [Joe Biden] inclined not to get in the race.Remember that.I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things.I’ve been a famous person for a long time.Bye!These are special people and we got a little boost last week from a place we all remember -- New Hampshire.I have great respect for these people.Thats a positive.OUR COUNTRY IS FLAT BROKE.Do you mind?We will make America safe again.In other words, if they do not treat us fairly.Once I said Im running, they said "What?You know, were having a celebration.That I can tell you.Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they cant depend on us.America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder.That’s correct.What’s going on?No, no, hes a man of insult.I can tell you there are some that I — I’ve been watching for a long time.FAR WORSE.Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal.We dont eat it.Finally, as we imagine this new prosperity at home, let us also work to achieve real and enduring peace abroad.One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left.And thats the press.Its like a rocket.And were going to get it.Its a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly.You have the inner city problems that have been going on for ever.We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States  we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher.You know in many ways, its the cheapest thing we can do.There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything.Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.From Iowa.I dont think its appropriate.As I promised during the campaign, I have proposed a budget that eliminates the defense sequester and fully rebuilds the United States military.But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow.This is for a highway.We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.So China is spewing up all this stuff and were holding back.Think of that.Hes in favor of Common Core.Nobody."All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I’m working on it.She’s got to make that commitment.Truly our President doesnt know what hes doing.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs.Youre going to destabilize the Middle East.I have a natural instinct for this stuff.Were losing thousands of people waiting on line.And what happens?In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.Id rather take a million and throw it all over this room.Thank you.Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation.I will tell you that.Im so honored by this evening.They do great.I said, "Who are they?"You know, lets talk about for two seconds, lets talk about the Iran deal.Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenol young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian.And now, we’re going to take that to new levels.This is something everybody agrees  the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things  taxes paid.They died.Or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament.Believe me.China  taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base.But shes going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys.Hes not a natural born citizen.Remember, it starts on February 1st with Iowa.I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.How long a trip is that?”  “Seven hours.”  “Oh, great.”  We’re flying these massive bombers and everything.I like the Keystone Pipeline too.What happened is with Paris, theres a different mindset.And I said, "What about our children?"Three days itll explode and theyll say its Trumps fault.Thank you, everybody.Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don’t know what to do with it we have so much money.AND WE LOVE BOBBY KNIGHT.Q    Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack?But she wasnt nice.Thank you very much everybody.But the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we dont keep on bringing people who add to the problem.Right.For three years, they cant make a deal.Okay?And we’ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.Who has read The Art of the Deal?No longer will we tolerate one job-killing delay after another.I was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned.Did we show them something.In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders.They are all young people.You know, its supposed to be free trade.I mean, those were the ones that likedSo you know I saved those things.But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, “Oh, it should’ve been better.They don’t want that.We got nothing but problems.SO HERE IS THETORY, FOLKS.All you have to do is go and see Israel.Each one of your members lives in fear of a socialist primary challenger—this is what is driving impeachment.Tremendous cash flow.They love the owners, the stores and things.And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to.Ive given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response.THE PRESIDENT:  I will do that in honor of a paper I once loved.There was with Obama.He was there.The wall just got 10 feet taller."Why dont we take some questions from the press?I get along great.THE PRESIDENT:  And the other thing — very important — I believe wages will start going up.SO IMPORTANT.I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.President Obama has not been a friend to Israel.There’s nobody.Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair.I shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail.They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.They never can come back.JUST REMEMBER THAT.Im a messenger.The Palestinian Authority rejected it also.But if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, its impossible.But they short — it’s a con job by the Democrats.1 one with Hispanics.You are the ones Obstructing Justice.We want to have a strong country.So we dont know.These are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage.Q    Mr. President, could I ask a question, since I am from the New York Times —

Q    Mr. President —

Q    — before this gentleman?ONE OF THE PEOPLE STANDING RIGHT THERE, SAID TO ME, MR. TRUMP, ARE YOU AN ISOLATIONIST, AND MR. TRUMP -- AND I SAID NO.Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.No, no, I do that.My wife didnt even believe me, but now she does.Its never below zero.Hes going to be fine.He said, "Youve totally changed the landscape of politics; its forever going to be different.We are going to take care of our veterans.I THINK IT IS HER GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT.Spoiled guy.(Applause.)The bill that I will ultimately sign — and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we’re going to get it done — we’ll get rid of Obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family.And I like Gov.The horror is beyond description.Miss Universe, by the way, I made a great deal when I sold  oh did I get rich.I didn’t do anything for Russia.Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.Okay?It’s at the highest level.Q    You’re not putting these —

THE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.They said, "Lets wait."You gave them $150 billion.I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these ...NO.But theyre also leaving because we have $2.5 trillion at least  I think its a much higher number than that.Were going to bring our jobs back.You’re gonna be happy.Its abysmal.We need a cheerleader.You watch.How dare you say Im brilliant?Theyre not being responsible because were losing a lot of people because of the Internet.Unbroken.When you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here.You dont need a president with no strength or stamina when were being ripped off on trade, were being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good.I’m proud of that.Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution.Im going here  were going to stay tomorrow.And everybody wanted his endorsement and Im very honored that hes giving it to me and hes going to give it to me on the stage.What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that’s coming out this afternoon?And when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration.We can save our country.Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance.Q You said you loved WikiLeaks.No, I was right.Wont be as good as the one Im going to build but its a wall.I dont want Nabisco leaving for Mexico or any place else.They want to see things properly taken care of.TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY DO TO THEIR HOSTAGE AND PRISONERS AND YOU'LL FIND OUT ABOUT TOUGH PEOPLE.How do you like him?Very big evening.Theyve taken our jobs.Can you believe it?Its a noisy majority.I dont know enough about it to comment on it.We don't win with the military, we can't beat ISIS.And Ill tell you what.You just cant do it.WE'RE GOING TO FILL IT UP.You better hope Im President.Jeff Sessions is one of the most highly respected people in the United States Senate.Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half — strong borders.He said, "Oh, I didnt know I was a citizen of Canada also."We had 24,000 people.What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan.I was invited.Another one had other things happen.They like Christmas.Boom!I’ll be back.I want money, money.It’s time.Were being laughed at all over the world.You’ll have to ask John McCain why he did that.Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.You go to LA the LA cops.You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse.To win by that kind of a number is incredible.We have the greatest business people in the world.They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.They closed down the city."Its just so important because our country has been taken away from us.I contributed to everybody.I mean, a lot of good things will happen.I couldnt believe.The problem with the Iran deal was that Secretary Kerry was like an amateur.She said, "If you dont run, youre never going to poll before.He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.We got ISIS and many other problems in return.Maybe we’ll head into Miami actually.Great state, great people.TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces theyre not going to Tennessee.Very bad for us.And China is not open, but we’re open to them.Look at the worst education.And, Lynne.So I just want to pay my respects to Ben.When does it help us?I can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me.They dont go anywhere.So, we are going to do things and this country right.We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.Premiums have soared double digits and even triple digits.Its something thats special.Theyre going to have some demonstrations.Were going to look at a lot of different things.You have an agenda.We pay rent.I know the good ones.But he was a Senator from Texas.And actually, infrastructure is something that I think we’ll have bipartisan support on.And heres, you talk about twisted, heres another twisted part: testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made!Q No, it’s not going to be a bad question.We have very different qualities and we are extremely different.She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.Q I’m just a reporter.I could be persuaded also.Why do you put this guy on television?Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case?Eugene Washington, a man I like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there.Its going to be down  I dont think it even survives.AND GITMO, WE'RE NOT CLOSING GITMO.But I just love you.If for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing  remember, Im a good prognosticator, Im a good predictor  the first thing thats going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue Ted Cruz.Q    — before the Judiciary Committee.Thats what a deal is.The Bank of America building in San Francisco  I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows.Im going to do some myself.Okay?I know how to do this.Or theyre going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it.(Laughter.)And you've all heard that hundreds of times.Woman:
So we thank you.And were going to make it rich again, and were going to make it strong again.And remember this: So out of the almost $6 million that was raised not one penny did I take for administration cost.If we get attacked, Japan doesnt have to help us.Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.And the reason is  you know why?And in those dark days fighting  right now all the tubes have been removed and I have a Do Not Resuscitate Order and I have a seven-year-old son  in those days in the hospital, I received from you a handwritten letter that said, "To the bravest woman I know."We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.So thats good.It’s very heartwarming to see.PERSIANS, GREAT NEGOTIATORS.With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say.America is friends today with former enemies.Were number 28 in the world.He said, “Oh, what did I get it for?”  With me, I probably will never get it.These people, they work like endlessly, endlessly.What is Monmouth?Can you imagine large groups?Ive had tremendous success.And we will make sure that that takes place.I promise you.In fact, we have four special elections currently underway in Georgia — we won — Montana — we won — Kansas — we won — and South Carolina.It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world.So when I say "Mexicos going to pay for it," these guys on the stage with me, theyre not business people.But  and if we have Hillary  Ive got to tell you.Now, the bad news is theyre always wrong.Many more.Okay?Im never going to let you down.And so, you dont like to use it.I mean, why are they even saying it?Everybody got out  and they kept our equipment.Explain it.He was so rough with Chairman Kim — Kim Jong Un.When you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing.Its really trouble for him.In Florida, they spent $38 million on negative ads and I won it in a landslide...Does anybody read?But you know what?Its not going to happen.
