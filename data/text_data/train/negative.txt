We go back to war tomorrow morning.(Applause.)You’re going to have parents and you’re going to have unbelievably talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be well-educated because it’s so important.Phony.Q No, no, no.And the people that were on the other side of the argument didnâ€™t have a chance, right?We’re going to change our thinking.We don’t have victories anymore.We see it.YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR PRIDE BACK.Tell you.Q    Nothing to do with me.We got some people running some countries that are bad people."Mr. Trump, where are those hats made?"Explain it.And I would never, ever give that up to go between first and second in Iowa.On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.You have to run.Oh, it’s because (ph) of gas.These guys are fierce.Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world.But our partners must meet their financial obligations.I’m the only one that wins these polls and I get negative publicity.They can pay their workers more, sell their products and services at lower cost, and still make more money than their U.S. competitors.I've gone to all of them.I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said I’m 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people.It’s gridlock.We want to get over 51, right?He’s got these followers."It’s not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know, it has its home.And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United Statesâ€™ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.Twenty-five, 35, 45, even 55 percent.Believe me.Why should I be nice to that person if I have a person that’s not going to support me?We’re going to have huge problems.Thank you.I don’t want it to be about me.He said he doesnâ€™t think anything is wrong.It’s not their thing....I’m only doing this so they don’t sue me but I don’t mind if they do.And one of the things I thought I’d do and I’d stress so strongly – the veterans hospitals – obviously they have problems.There should be more people like you in this country.THE PRESIDENT: Sure.That pattern practiced by the President and his administration, including former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way.Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.I can tell you we are going to have a wall.I built a great company.Right?You know, the way it’s supposed to be.LOOK, THE CAMERAS AREN'T MOVING.I donâ€™t like what he did.They’re fed up.We’re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high.The worst I had was a second.Corporate inversions.Remember the famous apology tour.They say "We will build there."Okay?Iâ€™ve been accused.WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING.You know, they have the tar sands, which is a problem for them.HE SAID, WE WILL NOT PAY FOR THE F-BOMB WALL.You look the other day you saw Carrier moving down.Q    Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack?The unemployment rate is probably 20%.We will make American Great Again.The 2nd Amendment is going to be with us if I’m president.You know, we can do a little question and answer.(Applause.)That’s what we’re going to do.They wanted her dismissed from the case.We have to do it.I am.No.We have so many problems that are interrelated that we donâ€™t even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused.When I was young â€” and I think weâ€™re all sort of young.I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street.I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want.THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me.You look at all of the places, Florida included.Thank you very much.Okay?They’ve agreed you know that for 2.5, 3 years.Maybe itâ€™s not, and thatâ€™s okay too.You can not do it!Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.A friend of mine can’t get stuff over there.You know that’s not good.Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they havenâ€™t had delivered to for a long time.Itâ€™s the fake, fake media.A writer called up and he said recently – I told this story.Congratulation to my husband.Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nationâ€™s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.(Applause.)For the most part, you can’t even get on Texas and various other states now.But you just take a look.There are so many things.It was disgusting.Your party simply cannot compete with our record: 7 million new jobs; the lowest-ever unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans; a rebuilt military; a completely reformed VA with Choice and Accountability for our great veterans; more than 170 new federal judges and two Supreme Court Justices; historic tax and regulation cuts; the elimination of the individual mandate; the first decline in prescription drug prices in half a century; the first new branch of the United States Military since 1947, the Space Force; strong protection of the Second Amendment; criminal justice reform; a defeated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the worldâ€™s number one terrorist leader, al-Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a breakthrough Phase One trade deal with China; massive new trade deals with Japan and South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming the worldâ€™s top energy producer; recognition of Israelâ€™s capital, opening the American Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a colossal reduction in illegal border crossings, the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the building of the Southern Border Wallâ€”and that is just the beginning, there is so much more.You know, we started at nothing because nobody believed I was going to [run].We’re building it.We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.Think of it.They’re easy.If he loses, great.And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but that means theyâ€™ll go out, and theyâ€™ll spend their money.It was so important to Ivanka to insist on being here so thank you.Twitter has removed many people from my account and more importantly they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all.

Total Bias?I would have had the greatest Super PAC in the history if I would have taken all the money.I MEAN, YOU SAW THAT WITH THE E-MAILS.Look, I told you before – Mexico – $45 to $50 billion.She’s horrible.What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time."Oh, we’ll inspect tomorrow."I’m telling you.I mean, thatâ€™s part of it.Believe me, it doesn’t help us.When I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story.We can’t live like this.I had one of the politicians – Kasich – who is just getting – he’s a horrible debater…He made a statement that "Oh, they left after 10 minutes."So you have companies leaving the United States and they’re leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of

rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.I don’t mind it coming from the opposition...What I do mind is when I raise all of these millions and when we started out nobody ever thought it was going to be over $5 million or close to $6 [million].I’m going to win.I love Las Vegas.They’re going to say "Trump wouldn’t give us the answer."We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.They tried that in France, which has among the toughest

Oklahoma.Michigan.You see whatâ€™s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places â€” low-pay, low-wages.In the NBC poll, I think we went from 26% to 29%.We

wall.And you know, with the evangelicals, I’ve had so many ministers.But it had taken me back to June 16th.We have a president who won’t even talk about the term.BUT THEN WE WERE THERE.Thereâ€™s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the â€” you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isnâ€™t that wonderful.Theyâ€™d come up to me and say, â€œSir, you canâ€™t have peace in the Middle East without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.â€  I said, â€œWhy?And it’s a movement of intelligence, actually.They’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home.These are the people – you know, if these people about Trump – they call it like "No Trump".I have a wonderful family.You know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war?That is a nice one.What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order thatâ€™s coming out this afternoon?We can’t let everybody in the world rip us off.I’m the only one — believe me, I know them all, I’m the only one who knows how to fix it.And they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal.I really have a great family so I just want to thank all of you.I know Dick Cheney will not stand on this one.Believe me, they’re our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants.Thatâ€™s not great.We want to have a strong country.Wow.NO.Alice, please.And we saw it.But a lot of people are happy about it.Marco Rubio has made this point.As far as Iâ€™m concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.I mean, you can be rich but you don’t have to be stupid.I would say I’m a man of common sense.I haven’t even focused on her yet.When he landed the plane in Saudi Arabia, which we protect.The bottom line on that – it’s such an interesting question.We gave them everything.We set a record everywhere.No, they thought I was going to apologize.I wouldn’t say 100% but about 90%.Just do it."So we take that and it’s something that I think is important.Now, itâ€™s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I donâ€™t think I ever met him.Theyâ€™re building another wall.And theyâ€™re raising them because weâ€™re doing so well.We’re going to take care of our vets big league, by the way.Ivanka and Jared have been amazing.Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow.You know, maybe none of us did.They sweated like dogs.Iâ€™m having a good time doing it.(Applause.)I’m going to be America’s champion.Sheâ€™s got to make that commitment.But actually last week, the big story was how fast the Republican Party is healing because it is a healing process.Look!(OFF-MIKE) Thank you very much, everybody.We spent $2 trillion, we have thousands of deaths, and I’m not even talking other side.Things that are so false.And Iâ€™m saying, weâ€™ll do things for you, but you got to build new plants all over the place.Walls work 100 percent.So what happens?So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.I’m going to do it.Special.Did you reject a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau?You saw them.That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.So that was very important.There wasnâ€™t one story other than Fox.I mean it was total phony story.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.She wants to destroy your Second Amendment.And the following will be my priorities.And the press can stay for that, and Iâ€™m sure they have no questions about last night because it was such a good launch.I mean, he started with the insults, as you know.oh And it only makes common sense.Thank you.Thank you.And the guy – oh, I beat him so badly.(Applause.)Right?I learned about the Iowa.I have many, many people – many, many people from Mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments.I mean, what is my competition?Thank you.And at the end of the game, I said, "Who won?"I’ll do it.I think we’re going to do so well.Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening.I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution â€” highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats â€” you may not see that, but heâ€™ll get there one way or the other.If you can get away with it, you do it.AND NOW IN ONE WAY I WAS HAPPY.All of the good work, which is 99.9%.But I think weâ€™re going to.I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and I have to say many years but many are saying that I was right to do so.We have to be vigilant.That was one of your platforms during your campaign.I watched those very closely â€” much more closely than you people watched it.Now, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate.I think it will be one of the great catastrophes.Congress â€” I think Congress is going to make a comeback.We’re going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it.There’s nothing else.We knocked the hell out of Iraq.Trillion dollars.But just yesterday, Obama just yesterday he brought it up that he’s very unhappy.Think of this Capitol.He doesn’t know where the hell – ra ha.…So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn’t have had the carnage that you had in Paris.We will, we will, I promise we will.Believe me, I couldn’t sleep.And what he did with that whole thing was a disgrace.They don't know what that means.I then mentioned the Attorney General of the United States.They build ramps.Absolutely no respect.And Jared, who is so involved â€” he loves Israel.But I know whatâ€™s good.And weâ€™re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.But like bigger like the George Washington Bridge.Young man.I do The Apprentice.Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me â€” 99.9 percent.I don’t want them in our country.For too long, a small group in our nationâ€™s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.And then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy.South Carolina.I see his name all over.No, not at all.Not going to happen, folks.She’s horrible.Point after point, we lost.Now weâ€™re all on the same side, so I like â€” see the guy over there?What we’re trying to do – make America great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both militarily and we don’t win anymore.When I saw Paris I changed.But Bill Kristol – I’ve been watching this for two years.They have no interest right now in testing nuclear.Then I saw the tape.…I’m going to go there right after this.That’s what will happen when Donald Trump is President of the United States.We saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community.Q    â€” ahead of tomorrowâ€™s hearing.We’re going to build a wall.It’s been an amazing thing....A poll came out a few days before that said I was about 5 points so maybe there was a tinge.We’re fighting them in Yemen and yet we’re making a deal with them.Too bad.There are so many.They laugh like hell.Right?God bless the United States.Under construction are many hypersonic missiles.And we must — we have to and we will make America great again.Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.And I say why?You weren’t allowed to have any more.We have some good people.Okay?I donâ€™t have to rush it.â€  Thereâ€™s no â€” you know, secession of sanctions.THE PRESIDENT:  What weâ€™re probably going to do is call it the â€œUSMC.â€  Like the United States Marine Corps, which I love.I donâ€™t think so.You know in the old days if you spent less and you had far fewer people and you were leading you got credit.You know, we’re building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we’re converting it into one of the world’s great hotels.And what do they do with the money?They get Yemen.And by the way, the easiest thing – "Corey, you’re fired."As you get up in income, you pay a little more.Honestly, nobody else even knows about it.In this room, we have a couple of bad apples.Q    And what was that experience like for you?As far as the Commissioner is concerned, they’re having a rough year.This is incredible."I could have a lot of the Supreme Court judges, more than two.And they’re killing people.Sergeant Bergdahl – we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they’ve wanted for nine years.In fact, if things donâ€™t work out, even though a lot of people are saying this was one of the great political phenomenas theyâ€™ve ever seen.You said it was very divisiveâ€”it certainly is, even far more than you ever thought possibleâ€”and it will only get worse!He gets everything he wants.Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen, when he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016.It’s like they’re the Bobbsey twins.It sounds crass.Please.Why do you say that?She beat me out and she destroyed Germany.That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal.See, our country has this kind of security.But you know what?Very big evening.We have the highest levels of enthusiasm.We owe Japan more than that.We’re going to let them self-inspect.That one is going to be fun.BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CALL HIM AND YOU COULD EITHER SAY, GOVERNOR, OR VICE PRESIDENT, SIR, PLEASE, PLEASE SPEAK TO MR. TRUMP.But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.You are not just securing your own citizens, but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people.But today, it can take as long as a decade and much more than that â€” many, many stories where it takes 20 and 25 years just to get approvals to start construction of a fairly routine highway.But some people didnâ€™t step up.THE PRESIDENT:  I always like â€” always like to finish with a good one.We’re not going to be the dummies anymore.I’m not going to let that stuff.Great evening.He’s not a leader.And I’ve been treated semi-fairly by the moderators.I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.You see what’s going on in Germany.I donâ€™t watch it anymore because itâ€™s very good â€” heâ€™s saying no.Where is Steve?ALL RIGHT.I may be wrong.Good.AND GITMO, WE'RE NOT CLOSING GITMO.This wasn't close.They’d be gone.It’s true.Pretty good in Iowa.It’s something that’s special.Itâ€™s at the highest level.We might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest.Well, this is number one a simplification.We have to be progressive in our thinking.And what are we doing about this?SO ONE DAY HE LEAVES.Look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote.But somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing.They’ve been forming since last night and I’m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. We’re doing a couple of interviews and then we’re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that’ll be very exciting for me.And if I win Iowa, we’re going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we’re going to have such a great military and we’re going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that’s a nightmare.These are incredible people...Maybe they’ll be better.So, with Iraq, so we give them the date and they take over.It destabilized the Middle East.You know that they’re dying.They are making a fortune.Weâ€™ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.I put in the financials.(Applause.)But when you have free trade, you need smart people running your side of the free trade.I had people – teams of people – reviewing statistics, reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money.But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution.It would have been easier just to give the speech.I won’t even say.We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.And we have – we’ll do what we have to do in terms of ISIS and all.These people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think.But I said, it’ll take six months.We have a trade deficit with Mexico.Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.I mean, those are real numbers.And the Veterans Administration is run by Obama just as incompetently as he’s running our country.I love you.I could say, "Oh, let’s not do" – I am an evangelical.Sheriff Joe was there.BUT THE COACHES LIKE ME.And we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.You can’t talk.Thank you!She’s got no stamina.7/12/2016
WOW.They go around making it very difficult.I have also followed through on my promise to secure, protect and defend the borders of the United States â€” and, yes, we will build a great border wall at our Southern border.I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama.(Applause.)And in the package that we gave you, you’ll see there’s a poll and I’m number one with Hispanics.It's dead.But they’re never going to do anything with these countries.But people like to see it.Heâ€™s going to get us into a war.â€  You were going to have a war.Thank you.We’re not going to lose.WE HAVE TO.So, it’s just not going to happen.But I’m not going to have anything happen in Wisconsin.But they’re going to make a lot of money and, you know, it’s something we should consider.The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.So important the Second Amendment.Itâ€™s been a long time since we had fair trade.We’re going to do things about it.The other politicians come down, "you can't get Mexico to pay for the wall."I have never witnessed the spirit that our country has right now.So he is the worst negotiator worldwide.We don't do anything about it.I mean, she wasn’t asked one tough question.It’s so great to be in Florida.It’s just constantly."She had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant, OK?Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.Many – a proportion that’s close to 50%.And I don’t know if you’ve heard, one of the presidents or ex-presidents of Mexico held a news conference.[ CHEERING ] WELL, WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DISCUSS, BUT WE HAD SOME VERY BAD NEWS A FEW DAYS AGO, AND YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?We're going to start winning.They want to see good health care.So they’ll get 2 million – a million to 2 million people at the debates.You’ve got to be smart-tough.And they said, "Well, he’ll never ever put in his financials."This is your time.To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand.A couple of people on the stage that I really respect, I’ve gotten to respect.Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop.You can have it.Q    I think it would be great if a female reporter â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  What does it mean?I won’t go over all of the different things because maybe you’ll change your minds.(Applause.)BECAUSE I AM IN FAVOR OF FREE TRADE.Think of it.I don’t want to send a $250,000 check to a group that doesn’t do good work.There is no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you are going to hurt the snail.BUT THE SINGLE GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENON THAT HE'S SEEN IN HIS LIFETIME IS DONALD TRUMP AND ALL OF US, THE WHOLE THING.THEY ARE SO DISHONEST.Don’t worry about profiling.And we want jobs, manufacturing in this country.They donâ€™t have to be doing this.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world â€“ but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.Thank you, folks.THE PRESIDENT:  Since youâ€™re where?I mean, who makes these deals?Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.I didn’t say it.We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.When are you coming home?"We’re doing really well with the Tea Party.He doesn't build buildings.Itâ€™s been very bad for the United States.America is the place to do business.Thank you very much.So they don’t talk about corporate inversions at the debates.Right?The truth is they don’t respect us.So you know, the point is that the establishment can’t believe it because they’ve never seen it happen before.It’s a good question.It poured.That’s 44% with 15 people.But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people.They come into this country and kill members of their family.God bless you.I guess I just heard when I walked in one just came out that we’re 10 points up.In fact, I brought a list just in case that question was asked.Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.You look at countries like Mexico, where they’re killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border.But, a guy who’s really respected, recently, and he said, "How does it feel?"Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.Could happen.It’s really complicated.They have no choice.But to show you how important this forum is and how important the country is to me and how important Israel is to me, it’s so important, I don’t mention my projects.THE PRESIDENT:  We did well in West Virginia.And so many people say, you know, I have so many Jewish friends where they say why did I support Obama?So and So, I don’t need your money and thanks a lot but we’re going to do it ourselves."(Applause.)How are you?The press â€” the public doesnâ€™t believe you people anymore.Go ahead.And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager.And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington."So we had a problem with environmental – look, I’ve won many environmental awards.We get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that they’ve wanted for nine years – the worst killers – and they’re all back on the battlefield.31,000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour.We need regulations, but many of them are unnecessary, and theyâ€™re going fast.You have to get people go to them.Now, I love New Hampshire.He’ll never get elected.And for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she’s going to vote for Trump.How do you do that when you have a Senator who’s sitting, you have a governor who’s been there for eight years and Trump – ?But the farmers say, â€œThis man is fighting for us.THE PRESIDENT: No, I donâ€™t think so.We’re broke, we’re broke.Next time weâ€™ll triple it up or quadruple it, right?I signed my form.We have a circle of veterans.The work of the NRCC never ends.But if you don’t stay in the United States you’re going to have a problem.Somebody will "Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech".The first paper – we all know about first papers.I said, wait a minute.So the establishment is not ever probably – look, you know what?They do all talk.Thereâ€™s zero chaos.I think itâ€™s great â€” the Congressional Black Caucus.And they’ll delay it until after the election."They don’t want to be killed.You get it fixed and you do the opposite.I think 11 is a lot of people.We’re down at this gorgeous green at Doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on.I don’t care."THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN REDUCED TO.(Laughter.)They’re not the JV folks.You look at what’s going on.THEY CAN'T GET PARTS.Whatâ€™s happening there is going to be incredible.By the way, I deal with the people in this room.No, but he said some things and I was like – I said "Who says that about an opponent?And theyâ€™re going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs.â€  But I think we can call them terrorists.We decimated their armed forces.GREAT NEGOTIATORS.One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they’ve built up and they can’t get back into our country.Very fair story.Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.You know whether it's China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea.We’re going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody’s going to play with us.I said â€” they said, no, sir.You look at the Middle East.And banks can be mean, right?But weâ€™ve done â€” Bob Lighthizer, whoâ€™s here someplace.When he does get them in, there’s a tax to pay.But I didn’t want to sell it.We just spent – it’s a story today.And that's what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.Some of you know it.And so weâ€™re very happy with that.And by the way, we have a lot of good people.We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.He knew.Worst education.WOULD IT BE THE ELECTRIC CHAIR.Q    Your remarks today.Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.I WOULD HAVE RATHER DONE IT MY WAY, BUT I RESPECTED MY FATHER.They are totally controlled by the money, and that’s not good for our country.That’s unheard of.I did that.I have a good life.When I showed one of the letters â€” just one â€” to Prime Minister Abe, he said, â€œThis is actually a groundbreaking letter.My preference is always peace, however and I’ve shown that.Go ahead.No matter what I say.And that takes a certain ability.Yes, go ahead.I mean, you have to ask about anything you want.Theyâ€™re out of this country.Youâ€™re going to be surprised to hear that.I said, "I don’t know if it’s appropriate Reince for you to be here because I don’t want anything – " You know, you guys will end up saying he’s endorsing Trump.I know in Romney’s campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars.That seems to be the big story that we’re beating – they call it the establishment.By the way, what President Moon said last night â€” I know you wonâ€™t report it â€” but Bret Baier interviewed him last night and he asked him about me.I said I can’t do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we’re going to win.Weâ€™re supposed to get rid of ours.Now recent polls have shown that I’m beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially.So they self-inspect, OK?There will be people – we’re reducing taxes.But we have at least 11 million – you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many.But we’re going to save Social Security, we’re going to save Medicare and that’s the way it is.On their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect.And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?And John McLaughlin – this crusty guy who I like; I don’t know him.And yet â€” itâ€™ll be the greatest cut, I believe, in the history of our country.We don’t want any of the money.It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do.He wouldn’t be able to do this.So important.Look, we have to have strong borders.We have to control, and we have to control them now, not later.But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking â€” I thought they were talking $350 million.So now they use extreme weather.[Audience response inaudible]
Like he was helping her.No, I want to get the industry – we call it the automobile industry.To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership.The Old Post Office site.But we must do more.We gave them Iraq.Unemployment – they have down 20%.With Japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right?We are going to straighten out Common Core.No PPP, you’re right about that and you mean no PP.Look!And China has lost trillions of dollars.But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can’t sustain ourself with that.IT WAS TOUGH TO WATCH FOR EVERYBODY HERE IT WAS TOUGH TO WATCH.Hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs are being taken out.And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.But that’s the statement of an inexperienced man…About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in.These are extraordinary people.Well, we’re going to stage something properly also.I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that’s what it is, is a movement.You know, maybe there’s something with the crazy computers.You’re losing jobs...It’s very average.I SAID HOW IMPORTANT IS THE WALL?But I want them to come back with papers.She was a very private person.And heâ€™s been great.Here, you’re born over here, "Oh, congratulations we’re taking care of the baby for 85 years."We went to different places, and there were hundreds, hundreds of bikers out there.Nobody knows.I don’t want to say no.SPEECH 1: President Trumpâ€™s Address to a Joint Session of Congress - Feb. 28, 2017

Thank you very much.After a full and partial and long — really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.And I went there and I worked very hard and I campaigned and I made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people – incredible people.I am.So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School.And we're going to take care of our vets.Okay?Whether it was presidential or not I can’t tell you.I don’t care about names.And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore.I don’t really think – look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally.Shouldn’t have been there.You know, we’ve bonded with the people whether it’s there or here.But we’ve got some real bad ones and they’re out of here.You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much.And I know youâ€™re going to come back.It’s true.And theyâ€™re willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.Today is Judahâ€™s 81st birthday.You donâ€™t think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you?Speeches all over.Theyâ€™re great fighters.She is a very good person and sheâ€™s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign.And then they don’t want it.And I go home and my wife said were there many people?They want to change your religion.We don’t do them this way anymore.We have great plans.America is going to be reliable again.So I said to myself, you know, nobody’s ever going to know unless I run, because I’m really proud of my success.(Applause.)They don't know what is happening.Imagine the wonders our country could know in Americaâ€™s 250th year.We get this horrible, dirty rotten spy – horrible traitor.So that if you go to the doctor’s office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days.You can’t use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone.I know the good ones.Thank you.Calderon.I didn’t have anything to do with it.We have interest rates that are so low that if you’re rich like me I can borrow money for any amount.But we have some of the top people in the country worked on this.And they voted for me and they love me.Everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven’t been able to make a deal.THE PRESIDENT: Hereâ€™s the thing.Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.Okay?I don’t even know you.Fox had 24 million.I have a great family, nice people, wonderful people.And a simple act of Congress gets rid of it.And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals.THE PRESIDENT:  They wouldâ€™ve given her time last week.They don’t have anchor babies in Mexico.It’s so simple.Even the other side says, "We agree.(Applause.)I'm leading in every poll with the Hispanics.Look, look â€” I like Mr. Bannon.But in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll.My last score was 78%.Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and weâ€™re starting that process.It is time to make America great again.They’re going to pay for the wall, folks.I know whatâ€™s good and bad.The Democrats don’t.They have taken advantage of our country.THE PRESIDENT: I was okay with it.Q    Thank you very much, Mr. President.Ask the people that support him.He said he doesnâ€™t believe it.Good.Absolutely nothing.Every birthday â€” (applause) â€” hi, Grace.Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon.Nice, right?And you understand that very well, John.I don’t hire their people.Itâ€™s a very simple.The 2nd Amendment.Great guy.Not working.(Laughter.)And in some cases, they do report it.I have a simple message for them.So I said, "All right.There can be wars between countries, there can be wars.Number one.It’s a great company.And weâ€™ll talk about it, and youâ€™ll be able to ask me questions about it.I am a unifier.Go ahead.And we’re going to make it nice and simple.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.But we have to do something about these teleprompters.I was there.Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our people.So this man tells me about the manufacturing.Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody whoâ€™s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice â€” Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today.We have all bad trade agreements.Weâ€™re not giving them anything â€” okay?Q    I do love Thomas Jefferson.Itâ€™s unbelievable.That number is so false.And if I'm elected president, that will happen.THE PRESIDENT: Just the way I said it.Number one, he won’t want to give up his lifestyle."The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office.Because you get a lot of bad decisions.I said, I guarantee you that we’re going to build a wall.Everybody â€”

Q    But â€” but that happens often.So with ISIS – Trump 46%.Slate, 51 percent.Like they’d come into your office.I mean, whatâ€™s going on?VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country what’s going on.Bomb.And I didn’t have to do that.We all go through Liberty and somehow he liked what I was saying and perhaps he liked the way I said it.You know, Trace came onto The Apprentice.(Applause.)We have illegal immigrants.I said, "Well, in about two and a half weeks."We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin.And under the previous administration, our military was depleted â€” badly depleted.Oh, here’s one that I started and I took a lot of heat.We have to be vigilant.You know?I’m not taking any money.Once he hits me, I promise you.Talk.So we spend the most and we're at the bottom of the heap.One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election.He was at 3%.We don’t.I don’t know enough about it to comment on it.And they were comparing it.THEY SEE WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE.I’d actually rather – I love – by the way, this is not a politician speaking.I know it.And the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States.They’re going to pay for the wall.You go to LA the LA cops.And he was right.I said, "They send it back?"There was one that I just saw.In fact, I’ve been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall.The convention center held 5,000.Fake, fake news.So he lost the election.Very valuable.He understand.And itâ€™s a big story.I’m with the – I’ll tell you what.You know full well that Vice President Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was digging into the company paying his son millions of dollars.Oh, do you want to hear "The Snake"?I’m a big believer.Q Thanks.But all of these politicians that I’m running against now, they’re trying to disassociate.We’re going to build the wall, you know that.And people started looking.Whoâ€™s a vet?And we have all the cards.That’s a bad fight.THE TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED IN LOUISIANA AND MINNESOTA, IT WAS TOUGH.We are forever grateful.Did everybody like the speech?I HEAR WE'RE LEADING ALL OVER THE PLACE.As a country, we don’t win anymore.What a disaster.And no other President has done this.You know, "Trump says bleh".Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics â€” numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government â€” show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Thereâ€™s not violence on the border?They’re going to come in, they’re going to do a great job.It’s ridiculous.The failing New York Times.Jim.I mean, Mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of NAFTA.Again, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a Canadian citizen joint with U.S. until 14 or 15 months ago.I’m not going to even mention names.I can talk about what’s happening.So these talking heads – most of whom are not even smart people, believe me.I will.And I don’t bring it up as braggadocio.He talks about medical cards.That’s a positive.What do you â€”

THE PRESIDENT: And some of it â€” and can I be honest with you?Do you ever see him – he walks up and he walks in with the Bible, held high.It wonâ€™t be depleted for long.Again, they sent 3,000 people home.I want to thank so many of your state leaders â€” State Party Chairman Scott Golden; Congressman Scott DesJarlais; Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn; Congresswoman Diane Black; Congressman Jimmy Duncan â€” right from the beginning.But the border by itself right now is doing very well.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor.Nobody gave this kind of money.Then we said who it went to, then we said how much was it.So thank you very much everybody.Itâ€™s very important to me, and especially in this position.Here’s the story.This is an amazing thing that’s happened.They donâ€™t want that.I want clean, crystal water.AND BATHROOMS ARE ALWAYS TOUGH.And Ivanka -- you know we have a hospital ready just in case.This could be the all-time great Trojan horse.I did see a reporter last night â€” a guy I like, personally, a lot.And they werenâ€™t spending â€” I mean, they had a much less â€” they had a much smaller amount of money.I donâ€™t want to.â€  You know, â€œI spoke to somebody 38 years ago, and it may not be good.â€  We have a country to run.AND WE HAVE TO SAY TOGETHER, AND WE HAVE TO BE STRONG.So a lot of people don’t know we protect Japan.OK. Who are the people that think this is a good thing for us?You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office, and it turned out that that was fake news.And March Dinner Chairman, Steve Womack, and the NRCC Finance Chair, Ann Wagner â€” thank you.This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier â€” not just a simple concrete wall.And I’m not a politician fighting, I’m me....You’ve been paying into Social Security and Medicare, by the way.We doubled it.This guy – and don’t forget that.We’re broke.And I’ll tell you what.The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare.I don’t know – 10,000, 15,000, maybe 25,000.But you know what?Nothing.So anyways, I don’t think that you’re going to fall for that.We lose with our military.I'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one.Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they’re serving.You know, again, we donâ€™t have our people in because we canâ€™t get them approved by the Senate.But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive.Look at your jobs.They need a lot of different things.35% to 18% to 9% to 2%.THAT IS AN EASY JOB.Then CNN a couple of weeks later had 23 million.But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country.They can’t even get along when they agree.(Applause.)These are brave people.Really successful guy.Believe me.They’re dealing against the smartest people in China, the smartest people in Japan, the smartest people from all over the world, and our negotiators are political hacks and we’re not using them anymore.I know who is saying it.Now, if they want to go to a different state, good luck, compete.They knocked the hell out of Gadhafi.I'M ENDORSING YOU.It works.We were a country going to war.And then he goes again.Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.I lead -- I lead with the Hispanics.It’s an imbalance.I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards.Oh, I wonder why.These are our veterans.I don’t think it’s gonna happen.Probably weâ€™ll say Nov. 8 plus the next four years and then four years after that, OK?Took on Trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster.Okay.No, I’ve been nice to Christie but he really hit me today.So beautiful.And it’s very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you’re supposed to do it, including me.He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry.This has been a truly great honor.But she wasn’t nice.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.Weâ€™re going to reduce your taxes â€” big league.And by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS â€” a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs.It's incredible.Don’t forget if I didn’t bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldn’t be asking the question.Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation.In about two minutes, I’ll call her.And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against – and he’s right on that – will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible.Take me back to Washington, Jim.Jeff Sessions is a person that I believe that Ted Cruz has the most respect for and I think Ted thought that he would get an endorsement.So there’s tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.Boy, Bobby Knight was incredible.The wall’s going to cost $10 billion to build.I mean, her whole life is corruption.The mother saw them.IN FACT, THEY JUST TOLD ME, MR. TRUMP, SIR, YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF "TIME" MAGAZINE AGAIN THIS WEEK.We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino â€” hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts.We’re going to make it so good.And weâ€™re trying very hard to get it.But growth will straighten it out.Q (Inaudible.)Look, we want to be fair to everybody.Everybody likes Christmas.I couldn’t believe.We’re going to put America back to work.I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless.We lost of thousands of lives.But Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam and all of –
And we’re not going to be losing our companies.Mr. President, a lot of the money â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Were you saying I was prepared?OK. He’s not a protester.You conducted a fake investigation upon the democratically elected President of the United States, and you are doing it yet again.And that one.You saw what was happening with the IRS and what was taking place with regard to certain groups.But you don’t hear that from anybody else.Iâ€™m running to reverse these failures.But Iâ€™ll tell you this:  The people that have complained to me about it the most â€” about whatâ€™s happening â€” are women.But that’s okay.So beautiful.And remember this; it’s really important.I'VE HAD DAYS THAT ARE SO GOOD, AND THEN YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND YOU SAY, MAN, DID THEY TAKE THAT.But it just takes one second.They can’t believe it.It’s a moment of time.And I didn’t ask for it.Sony is Japan.This enormous complexity is very unfair.Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?But today, there’s only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.What’s really important to me is the United States and making it great again.OK?WE HAD SO MANY COACHES, GENE AND DIGGER AND BOBBY.He was a great negotiator.This happened during the Lyndon Johnson presidency.We’re not losing.I did.Have to do that.Tax rates have increased, and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.Wow.Q    Mr. President, thank you very much.To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the motherâ€™s womb.This year.Well, I think there are a lot of economic issues.THE PRESIDENT: Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?A lot of good things...
And that’s going to continue because they’re not going to be able to do it, folks.Now, the big story â€” the retraction was, like, where?He said, Iâ€™ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.He and his wife left – I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California.And now I talk about protection.And it's got to be a beauty.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family, and this country.Q    I believe in facts and statistics and data, but â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay?I love China.A woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, "Mr. Trump, I’m voting for you.OK, so Gadhafi — they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people.I didnâ€™t talk to him, ever.They said a couple of hundred.We have no choice.So Iâ€™ve had numerous accusations about me.Young man, he’s brilliant.Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.BUT I'M IN THE CONSTRUCTION.This is the opposite of Hillary’s foreign policy, which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration, which is wrecking havoc all over the world and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East.I don’t know why.In 2015, the United Nationâ€™s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as â€œpeanuts,â€ and stated that â€œthe $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.â€  In 2015, the Green Climate Fundâ€™s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.He said, "We will never ever, ever pay for the wall."I think and I’ve been dealing with the press a long time.We have to address these issues head-on.Unfortunately, I donâ€™t know that you will ever give me a chance to do so.Think of it.We have no choice.I THINK IT WILL BE THE ELECTRIC CHAIR, RIGHT.As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.So, Ukraine – let’s take a few of these things and then I’m getting the hell out of here; I’m going back to New York.Great to be back in New York with all of our friends, and some great friends outside the building, I must tell you.They added up 23 50s.God bless you.He didnâ€™t even know what he got it for.After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before.Did you notice that?On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy.If you could pass that along.Would I bring my children into the administration?But let me give you the bad news.TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY DO TO THEIR HOSTAGE AND PRISONERS AND YOU'LL FIND OUT ABOUT TOUGH PEOPLE.Their whole economy would – you don’t have to go to war.I would have probably filed them even when I didn’t run because I built a great, great company.See Club for Growth.Love your country.THE PRESIDENT:  â€” really focus on that â€” and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined.Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.BUT YOU DON'T SEE CROWDS LIKE THIS.They’re not moving Iowa back.It’s time – you know Obama used to say, "Time for change"?I’m self-funding my campaign.But I think he’s been unbelievably rude.By the way, this election is not going to be like.But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.Okay?Let me tell you something.When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you’ve got to go and vote.WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.In the 1940s we saved the world.How about this?You don’t understand.And it’s going to be very interesting to see what happens.Can you believe — bringing peace to Syria.â€œWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he â€” see, it wasnâ€™t politically correct, because it should say he or she.How does this kind of immigration make our country better?According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law.And the reason is we have such big crowds like this one.But Carrier Air Conditioning moving to Mexico.THE PRESIDENT:  I said, exactly, â€œI look forward to watching her.â€  I do want to hear what she says.They’re going to have Iraq.But the truth is too early.Actually though what I got was worse than credit because they were questioning me.It’s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on.I never saw them do anything wrong.This has everything to do with our country.AUDIENCE:  USA!And she and my opponents — oh, isn’t it terrible that Putin said — wouldn’t it be nice if we could get along with the world?We need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores.IN THE OLD DAYS, I WOULD SAY THAT IS A BIG DEAL.Weâ€™ve covered a great deal of territory.(Applause.)And the leaks are absolutely real.Remember this â€” if we didnâ€™t do it the way weâ€™re doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.He is a very high quality person, this man.And regardless, weâ€™re going to keep our citizens safe, believe me.And I said, â€œItâ€™s true.â€  And I heard smiles.You know it, right?She hasn’t heard that from any other candidate.But believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that won’t be thrilled with this.I’m a job machine.They gave it to Obama.They have tremendous crime problems.I am with the people of Iran.THE PRESIDENT: Weâ€™re going to show great heart.They’re going to come in, they’re going to come in legally.We’re going to end Common Core.And I pay.They want it.Iâ€™m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.But wouldn’t it be great if they could make a deal?You know, when you think Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far.Right!How does it help us when they make it in China?This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuitâ€™s â€” in my opinion â€” flawed ruling.Then I said, "Wait a minute.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.But I will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you it’s 30%, 32%.I have to watch tomorrow.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more â€” so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?You don’t have time.I raised a lot of money for Mitt Romney.The rollout was perfect.I think we’ll be in much better shape.The knock-out is the knock-out."Q    Just to follow up â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  She stands up: â€œIâ€™d like to ask about three questions.â€  Itâ€™s not really fair to everyone else.They havenâ€™t respected us for a long time.Hillary wanted it built.(Applause.)They come into your office.And I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan.Actually, they’re very talented people.I filed my business papers.America is friends today with former enemies.My brand’s doing great.Thatâ€™s a good answer.A mess.It’s from China.And there are four or five in a page.That’s what we do.Ivanka and Jared – beautiful, beautiful grandchild.But if anybody has to have it, let it be them.Please, go ahead.But it doesn’t matter.And today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name.Very, very special people.That all changes â€“ starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.Itâ€™s time.In some of the cases theyâ€™re having DACA and theyâ€™re gang members and theyâ€™re drug dealers too.AMVETS – $75,000.I throw it into a chapter.Really good and Jared, Vanessa, Don.But they are really having trouble over in Venezuela.AUDIENCE:  USA!Right?Good job, too.At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone â€” almost double the number expected.We want to be fair.Letâ€™s just stop them.Thank you for joining me today.If they do an indie, assuming it’s decent, which I don’t think anybody with a reputation would do it because they’d look like fools.Right?I mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they’re all doing.See, I would have gotten rid of these columns, actually.I want to get the Gulf States to pay for it.And options in the Middle East became available.They didn’t have cranes.Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism.Q Iâ€™m just a reporter.I have two buildings because of China.Let me tell you, these people are losers.We want — they charge us rent?So, but I think he’s a fan.You said also that you had a call-to-action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism.We have to win again.And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, China and some others that are highly competitive, and really doing very well against us.That’s going to be a real wall.And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton.I don’t know who they are or where they are but you do.We’re going to put America back to work.Of course not.I had fifty people ... Is that a correct statement?I really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it.I would invite him, I actually would say.Guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for Romney.And I’m not angry at them.However, she’s really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words.Yes, maâ€™am, go ahead.Instead of fighting these wars that we don’t know what we’re doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we’re going to make it so great, so strong that people – gosh, they’re not messing.What his father did with Liberty College and Liberty University.We don’t like that deal.So could I ask Melissa to come up on stage please?You can understand what happened.They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for.Thank you, everybody.Thank you.And sheâ€™s angry for even suggesting it.But I think it would be a great thing for Israel – I think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made, and I’m going to give it my best.BUT WE'LL STRAIGHT IT OUT.Hillary Clinton â€” that was a reset.I know there have been some super PACs – 5 or 6 super PACs – where people are forming super PACs for Trump.But with us?They’d get along.And he said, "Mr. Trump, how does it feel?"And every year they fail to deliver.(Applause.)SHE SAYS YES, WE WILL FIGHT ISIS.They pay no tax.So Mark Burnett, who’s a great guy, he calls up and he goes "I don’t believe it.Because I raised $6 million for the vets in one hour.And all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where I’ve won and just look — we’ve gone from X number to a much larger number.When you look at what’s happening in Wisconsin – and you see it – the reason I beat your governor and I beat him badly was I just read off the statistics.Thousands.But I mean by a lot.I watch it.So we’ll leave it.A new era of prosperity will finally begin.You don’t want to waste time.How about two weeks ago, Nabisco announced a big — Chicago.We have to put people back to work.His advice I like to listen to, I’ll be honest.And even today they just announced many more.We’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them.The market is up tremendously today, not that thatâ€™s anything, but, you know â€” because Iâ€™ll go back in and theyâ€™ll say, â€œOh, the market just went down.â€  But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.They work all their life.We can make this country great again.(Applause.)He was winning.I think we will finish first.The whole country is in love...I call it the noisy majority.If we get attacked, Japan doesn’t have to help us.He said, "Mr. Trump, why don’t you this?"You’re going to go home and you’re going to remember this.This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true.Our infrastructure will again be the best in the world.But I’m not supposed to be running for office.And Dwight Eisenhower is going to say he moved 1.5 million in the 1950s, early 1950s, moved them out.Now, any class — it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States.First time, first time they’ve ever done it.And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trumpâ€™s very, very large brain.Did you see that with where I’m on?Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people.But the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing people who add to the problem.No, no.So I would’ve said they would have had a million or two.If you look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, theyâ€™re unhappy when itâ€™s seven, eight, nine.But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies."Take care of Hillary."Bill Kristol is a loser.We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?By the way, did Jeb endorse anybody yet?The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.I’ve been in terms of employment really a standout and I’ve been honored for doing so well with women.Deals â€” you never know.And we’re losing for two reasons.And if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences.Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that â€” and I quote â€” â€œRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.â€  Ryanâ€™s legacy is etched into eternity.I told him "You know what?He said, I have more accountants than I have patients.My hands are fine.WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT.It was a total lie.These are my goals as president.The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people â€” neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.People might say "It’s terrible.And it's out of control.So they’re borrowed up to the hilt and they can’t get jobs.So we’re going to see what happens.I was against the war in Iraq.We will make America proud again.I’m unpredictable."It’s a big industry.It’s not going to happen folks.Yeah, the criminal media.Weâ€™re becoming a drug-infested nation.But he said to me, the reporter, he said, "never been done before."Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.But with that being said, I may want to make a better deal because you know what?Letâ€™s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.But he’s done an amazing job and I think we’re going to see something really, really fantastic.Officer Matson, please.I could read it to you.I say, wait a minute, I made a speech.They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us.We're going to terminate Obamacare.We will prove worthy of this moment.I say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill.But we had 2,000 people.Small money.And nobody even knows where the money is going to.Not my demands, our demands.Four times more.They said, â€œDonald Trump is a nice guy.I guess we’re waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also.I mean, you look – especially women.I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese.Nothing wrong with it.Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed.So we have ISIS taking a lot of oil.THE PRESIDENT:  Nice to see you.Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement, that the statement is correct.Come on.But I have more…I wish we could call – is there any way we could call the election tomorrow?I think that is a very, very dangerous standard for our country.Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.(Applause.)You know?But if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter, right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure.But I am having a good time.You know why?(Applause.)No, I didnâ€™t.I love them.We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.JUST REMEMBER IT.And my father, Fred, was always a big supporter.He just said to me, and the thing that surprised me most, weâ€™re bringing business tax rates down from 35 percent to 15 percent.We came in second place.Right?So I — look, I’m a unifier.It is time to believe in the future.I read where a washer – you know what a washer is?They just are breaking.Trust me, the last person — she’s already gotten a dose last night, do you agree?Q Mr. President.We waited â€” we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in.So many great people.From my first international G7 Summit, to the G20, to the U.N. General Assembly, to APEC, to the World Trade Organization, and today at the World Economic Forum, my administration has not only been present, but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free, sovereign nations cooperate toward shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams.We get nothing.They used to move from New York to Florida, or they’d move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris.Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy.They devalued their currency and on top of it, they make it impossible.THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.You know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?I said, give us a retraction.TOUGH GUY.Itâ€™s all a lie.Together, let us send our love and our gratitude to make them, because they really make our countries run.They say, â€œWell, we fly the planes in from a short distance away.â€  I said, â€œWhere is that?â€  â€œGuam.â€  â€œOh, huh.I couldnâ€™t believe you said that.WE LOST EVERYTHING.Heâ€™s been a colleague, highly respected â€” brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it â€” but waiting for approval.So I think that we will be very successful in court.So they didn’t want her anymore because she’s a disaster for them.We’re going to be – you know, you look at what’s going on with Baltimore, you look at what’s going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night.They donâ€™t have the enthusiasm.They say, "Donald Trump can do almost anything."(Laughter.)And we had a great transition.Q    Mr. President.This was — in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three.But thereâ€™s no obstruction.We love it.Where have we had a victory as an example this horrible deal that was signed with Iran where we’ve given them $150 billion and we lose everything.They have thousands of people outside and sometimes they’ll say "Would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in?"And it’s great stuff.But just in a nutshell, I’m funding my own campaign.We’re going to be the smart people.Everybody knows it’s a horrible deal.I say it’s very easy.I’m not going to go after it like I would Hillary or Crazy Bernie.NUMBER ONE, WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER GONE IN AND NEGOTIATED THAT DEAL UNTIL WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK.We’re going to win on trade.Then two weeks later, I wore the red one.Does that make sense?It was actually $59 million a while ago.They have no – you know, the $150 billion we gave to Iran, these people have no concept.THE PRESIDENT:  I own a house in Charlottesville.So thank you very much.Very good feeling.But whatever.We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies.We’re ready to start shooting."I mean, it’s not that bad an ad either.(Applause.)Over the past 30 years, the average business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.I have a judge who’s very, very unfair.They have no concept of what they’re doing.To build on â€” (applause) â€” thank you.Then you see what happened.Laura Ingraham.So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win.I even held up my hands, and said, "Look, take a look at that hand."They love her.We want to build safe zones in Syria.Weâ€™re going to go back to Made in the USA â€” Made in the USA.â€ (Applause.)WHO KNEW WHAT WENT ON BEFORE RECORDED.But we’ll see because Feb. 1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out.Iâ€™m a facilitator.I hope they sue me because they don’t have enough money to sue me.And just great, great people.We hear Afghanistan.I do watch you.So I think what will happen is, sadly, weâ€™ll be sued, and sadly, itâ€™ll go through a process.Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates.The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there.They call it a tariff because it sounds better.And the press doesnâ€™t cover them; they donâ€™t want to, incredibly.You know, if that industry is upset, Iowa’s got problems.LET'S TURN THAT MUSIC DOWN.I watched that whole situation.Thank you, Dick.But I said, "No way am I not going to do it."…Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man.I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?It’s very simple.There was no collusion.And we’re going to love each other.You’re going to be so proud of your country.Thank you everybody.So, Obamacare, dead.And the number that they talk about when they say 5% unemployment – it’s a fictitious number.Yes.We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico.I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here.Mexico is going to pay for the wall.It cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but it took 17 years to get it approved and many, many, many, many pages of environmental impact studies.We have our heart in it.Q    â€” that shows undocumented criminals â€” or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.He’s going to be this great guy.They got to do that.And it said that they were being surrounded, and they were going in and starting â€” literally, the next day, they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35,000 terrorists.I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?I had the largest bank in the world as a tenant.Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I donâ€™t know.And you know what we’ll do?Just look at our borders.YOU KNOW HOW EASY A WALL IS?We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look.Today, that basic form has one hundred pages of instructions, and itâ€™s pretty complex stuff.But if I get in there, it’s going to change, and it’s going to change quickly.I mean, whatever it is.We’re losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion.WE DON'T WIN AT ANYTHING.Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.You have little opportunity.As far as women, whether itâ€™s a man or a woman, these are â€” you know, it can happen the other way.But in the meantime, we have millions more votes than Cruz.So together, let us resolve to use our power, our resources, and our voices, not just for ourselves, but for our people â€” to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes, and to empower their dreams; to protect their families, their communities, their histories, and their futures.Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didn’t want his money and he’s leaving.Oh, is that a bad thing?I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said, â€œListen, youâ€™re a very rich country.It's so simple.They do a fantastic job.Oh, good, I had nice crowds.AND IF HE DOESN'T, I'LL TELL YOU.You know, confidence â€” itâ€™s a confidence job.Many of the other countries havenâ€™t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.THAT IS A BIG ONE.Two, we canâ€™t handle.These trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country.Too much.You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!Like Beada might send me some money.(Applause.)But how about the 50 soldiers.What am I supposed to hate China because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment?And people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs — who the hell doesn’t know?I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS HOW SMART THE PEOPLE ARE.And that’s what happens with Common Core.In South Carolina we're going to have a baby.Please.Okay?She can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress these same communities.Why didnâ€™t they take care of Syria in the deal?They’re saying, "Dad, you’re going to do something that’s going to be so tough."How about that?They’re disgusted when they’re allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they’re standing there helpless and people just pour into the country.Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place?I’m never going to let you down.They call it "Never Trump".They keep it purposely.She gave me such a hard time.Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.Everyone’s shocked.It means a lot of business for our farmers.Just two years ago if he would have listened – can you imagine?We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost.I was a civilian.When she tells you about jobs, when she tells you sheâ€™s going to fix trade deals, she wouldnâ€™t know where to begin.But sometimes they like it but I don’t think it’s something they vote for, which is a shame because it’s actually a very big thing.But that’s an amazing stat.We must make America truly wealthy again.So when you see this happening, we have to stop it.And do you ever notice whenever there’s something that I do that’s proper but controversial, they’d say "Oh, now he’s gone.Walls work if it’s properly constructed.(Laughter.)The system is bad.Weâ€™re working right now on NAFTA â€” the horrible, terrible NAFTA deal that took so much business out of your state and out of your cities and towns, and weâ€™re working on it.Nobody ever talks about that.Q    Should that statue be taken down?I love it.You know who has the oil right now?Remember, folks, if we donâ€™t do anything, Obamacare is gone.We’re going to do something you’re going to be so happy with.YOU READ THE HISTORY BOOKS, THEY CHOPPED OFF HEADS.The love is unbelievable.It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.That I can tell you.The good ones.Iâ€™ve always been good at building things, and Iâ€™ve always been successful at making money.Nobody.When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.Turkey has been great.I’m a little bit down."The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan.No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith.I will be tossing and turning.I won’t even mention names.This was a great evening.Q Mr. President â€”

THE PRESIDENT: You okay?We also need to bring back in this country — because we see what happened — our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs.I wonâ€™t tell you where, but you can guess.This is a comeback of historic proportions.We’re going to make our own products.Thank you very much.Youâ€™re doing precisely what youâ€™re criticizing the President for doing.â€

Everyone, you included, knows what is really happening.And weâ€™ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but itâ€™s a massive number of people.I said, how about one week?The Obama administration couldnâ€™t have done it.So I get a call from the ex-president of Goldman Sachs who now works for â€” Gary Cohn.Ford, they’re moving this massive complex – they’re building a $2.5 billion plant and now they’ve just announced they’re building it bigger.And she’s with a friend of hers who’s very well-known, Chelsea Cooley, who is a tremendous, tremendous woman and just an amazing person.Almost all of them have been tremendously successful.With President Obama in his final year, yay!Now, weâ€™re all smart people.So weâ€™ll see what happens.In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomasâ€™s background investigation â€” not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation.I really don’t see that happening.But if you’re rich, you don’t need the money so you don’t have to borrow it.SO HERE IS WHAT I SAY.I mean, I just want to continue to do well...Our theme – the theme is so important.They can’t even get to see the doctor.(Applause.)Okay?I just heard about one a little while ago.Please.And I’ll win the Trump University case.We’re going to do that."If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and theyâ€™re a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.So I think you have a brand-new United States.When you look and when you listen to politicians â€” in particular, certain Democrats â€” they say it all comes through the port of entry.Think of it.But weâ€™ve done a fantastic job, but we havenâ€™t been given the equipment.And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.Thank you, darling.Please.LOOK AT THIS.And I always say, "Wow.There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left.I donâ€™t know what to do with all the money theyâ€™re giving us.And Romney I was very disappointed.Thank you.You know, when you look at costs, we just spent $1 million building a soccer field.That’s a great feeling.And I like him.He’s a friend.Thank you very much.She shouldn’t be allowed to run.I’ve been called on that a couple of times too.Thatâ€™s good stuff.Out of control.Nashville, it’s wonderful – " you know, is that I can sort of be very current.THAT'S TOUGH CONSTRUCTION, NOT A WALL.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.Big.Trillions.They’re leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax.SPEECH 7




Chris, thank you very much.We’re going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings, a lot of talks, a lot of speeches.You guys cannot come.No, I was right.Just let me do it folks.Thank you, Buzz.I think I’m going to win the Hispanic vote.I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.But Hillary Clinton — think of it.I think the way Walker – he saw it wasn’t happening, wasn’t going to happen and he just got out quickly.In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change.Iâ€™m sure Senator McCain must know what heâ€™s talking about.It won’t happen.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.We don’t eat it.21, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.I promise.But we had a massive field of people.Q â€” of the agreement between the two countries.It’s not going to happen.And I don’t say that braggingly.Although the election very quick.And we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us.SPEECH 5: Remarks by the President in Nashville, Tennessee - March 15, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.Our country is going to hell and people don’t understand that.But heâ€™ll probably hit me with a bad one.Why do you think they were laughing?I really don’t.Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell heâ€™s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country.I want to thank my wife and my family.But I guess it has been probably since ’04.I mean — but — but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq.Weâ€™ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.And I think we did very well – I think we did really well in just about everything we’ve done running for office.But many times people will say deals that the country makes, and they’ll say, "How can our politicians be so stupid?"But donâ€™t kill millions of people.Okay.We’re going to load it up w a lot of bad dudes out there.If you remember, I wasnâ€™t going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting â€” I wonâ€™t go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.The driver of the car is a murderer.He wrote me two of the most beautiful letters.Thank you.We’re going to do it.And it’s tremendous, tremendous amounts of money were spent – millions and millions of dollars.It’s politically incorrect to say Merry Christmas.I’ve debated him 11 or 12 times.All right?We're going to have an incredible convention.We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America....Well, we have to get discipline back in the country, forget about school.I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen.Folks, I win it’s not happening, okay?She does.And somebody from…it’s the same network – CNN again – he said, "You know the name anchor baby is very insulting?"We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.I’m doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide I’m winning with evangelical – I don’t know if you know that – by a lot nationwide.You can certainly have terrorists.But here, a total net worth of — net worth, not assets, not — a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York — many other places all over the world.Now, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President.They wouldn’t even be talking about it.I’m not angry China.Since President Obama came into office another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty.I’ve had great victories in terms of deals with China.Q    Sorry.It’s okay.Q Yes, sir.We’re dying.Sometimes four or five in a row.Youâ€™re making a fortune.When I didn’t do the Fox debate...because I didn’t think they treated me right but actually they’ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months, I have to say that about Fox.President Obama â€” in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.(Applause.)Right now, the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province.I’m in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer – this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of – saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee.I made a fortune dealing with China.Ben Carson endorsed me.My wife is sitting there.But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and thatâ€™s just been strengthened further.Iâ€™m also going to completely reform our trade deals.(Laughter.)I mean like number one by many, many times.They were pillars of their community.You have no choice.And one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close.We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there.I mean it.It’s not their wheelhouse.But we’re not going to cut your Social Security and we’re not cutting your Medicare.And remember what I said about Hillary.Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress.There they â€” OK. Now theyâ€™re standing up.Really ashamed.He doesn’t know.You need to get your head out of your butt.He actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit.And it’s coming ...


With these people, folks, it’s coming.SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO START THINKING SMART.Somebody else would — and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall.The worst, one of the dumbest deals I’ve ever seen.So when you read he has all this money, he’s paying a lot of money and that’s not reflected yet.In fact, a lot of the event didnâ€™t even happen yet, as we were speaking.We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel.All of a sudden itâ€™s out for the world to see.But itâ€™s very complicated.SO SERGEANT BERGDAHL THINKS HE LIKES THEIR WAY OF LIFE, OBVIOUSLY.I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that’s what it is – it’s a movement.Too few Americans are working.And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again!But you know, to stand there and to rant and rave for two days to show people you can filibuster, in the meantime, nothing was accomplished.I think we were back like two and a half months from the summit, which was a great success.I said, "How does what feel?"They don’t have to develop nuclear missiles.20,000 people showed up and I want to tell you, it was a love fest.And the money that you’re talking about is far less than the administrative costs.But that means youâ€™re never going to come back, folks.Doesn't win.You are going to — they are doing a big thing.I’m going to Green Bay.President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since September 11th.Thank you very much.It’s like a puddle and they’d consider it a lake.I could buy it from others.BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY BIG BEAUTIFUL GATE IN THAT WALL, BIG AND BEAUTIFUL.If you think, he won’t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on.How’s he doing in Iowa?No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.As we work to defend our peopleâ€™s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.And I think we’re going to have a very, very successful number of months.Somebody said "Are you going straight to New Hampshire?"They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all.They canâ€™t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.We won the presidency.None whatsoever.And just one person.TRUMP: (OFF-MIKE) This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what’s going on, and especially how poor she’d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism.If for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing – remember, I’m a good prognosticator, I’m a good predictor – the first thing that’s going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue Ted Cruz.Because we’re leading big in New Hampshire – every poll.Right?When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.And honestly, I wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters.They never pan the crowd.You have all of these disastrous airports.They didn’t have excavation equipment.And the lines are four, five, six blocks long.When they start dancing about a deal that I’m making, when they start burning the American flag, I’m out of there.And I say, "What are we doing?You’ll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly.If that was a stock, you’ve got to buy some.I love them.We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year — $58 billion.I said, "Who was it?"They say, "Oh but do people like Trump?"And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to, time and again, side with the accused and not the accuser.Thank you.I call him Lyin’ Ted.Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing in America, and the results are totally unmistakable.So they come to my office.So anyways, I wish him the best.ADD LEAST HE'S NOW ADMITTING IT IS GOING TO GET BUILT, RIGHT.One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President â€“- whether itâ€™s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.We have a country that’s sitting on a big fat bubble that’s going to explode.Sheâ€™s working very hard.I really do.Now, we have â€” hey, you know better than anybody â€” $700 billion and $716 billion.Premiums are going through the roof.Leading really big in New Hampshire.Those PACs, you never know what the hell is going to come out of those PACs.It can’t be where Wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks can’t get into China but China comes in here like it’s Swiss cheese.WE HAVE TO STOP FOUR MORE YEARS OF OBAMA.It’s not crass.We’ve created this.And I donâ€™t have to tell you what Iâ€™m going to do with Iran.Thatâ€™s a lot of â€” oh, Steve, go ahead.Theyâ€™re giving the women a major chance to speak.They never thought I was going to run.You can't have Bush.I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes.You know about this, right?Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:

First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.When I saw Aliceâ€™s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did something right.Think of it.Remember, it starts on February 1st with Iowa.I have a lead of 20%.They didnâ€™t say you broke â€” 23 years, you broke the all-time record tonight â€” $30.1 million.Iâ€™m going to deliver for you, believe me.Q (Inaudible.)I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television.THE PRESIDENT:  Right.I said, "What are you doing?"The border is in the best shape itâ€™s been in in decades.So weâ€™re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest.But in addition to that, they’re taking our businesses.It was choking our country to death.Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate.The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable.(Laughter and applause.)It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.The corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about.Q    But donâ€™t you understand, sir, that many of these â€”

THE PRESIDENT:    And I would look at the character â€”

Q    â€” many of these accusers â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I have to do â€”

Q    â€” are reluctant to come forward.Right?We protect them.That's a great thing.(Applause.)You can’t get rid of Medicare.She’s got a little problem.This isn’t necessarily – I mean, I’m having a good time.And itâ€™s not properly solved now.Another couple of years, there won’t be any jobs.THE PRESIDENT:  Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.The bottom line is we want results.All of them.Okay?They could do that.First of all for the record, I’m a state representative from New Hampshire, 10 years on the veterans affairs committee, 22 years in the Marine Corps, retired First Sergeant.So easy.And our guys were â€” and not Mike â€” but our guys were being, â€œOh well, weâ€™re working as fastâ€¦â€  I said, â€œI got all the time in the world.So we have to make our country great again.And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me â€” and she is the one that reported it.Thank you.John, go ahead.That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes â€” and Iâ€™m speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you.They love the Keystone Pipeline, and the whole Keystone Pipeline is based around eminent domain because you’ve got to go from Canada, where Cruz was born, to Texas, where he’s representing.They don’t believe those people in the back that write with fork.I thought his father was a great guy.Our nation has lost over 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization â€” 60,000.Now they’re spending, you know, hundreds of millions to run it.Itâ€™s okay, Jim.AND THAT GATE IS GOING TO BE OPEN.Crime is rising.But maybe the previous administrationâ€¦â€  Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.If I wasnâ€™t elected, you would have had a war.The last thing Mexico wants is Donald Trump as President in that I will make great trade deals for the United States and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.I love this city.AND WHEN THIS PERSON SAID TO ME, BY THE WAY, WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS NEVER DONE BEFORE, CONGRATULATIONS, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU WIN OR LOSE THE ELECTION, WHAT YOU'VE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, WINNING ALL OF THE PRIMARIES, BEATING GREAT PROFESSIONALS AND THEY ARE VERY TALENTED PEOPLE, IT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, YOU WILL GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS, MR. TRUMP.They all know it.We’re going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before.All I can tell you is it’s a massive tax.Our military is going to be unbelievable.We must invest in our people.They became rich raising money.That’s what we need for our country.And then you have the lottery.Matthew, please.And they are monsters.I CALL OBAMA THE FIVE-FOR-ONE PRESIDENT.One person â€” and theyâ€™ll be the story tomorrow â€” did you hear there was a protestor?"Trump isn’t going to run."They were the leaders of the whole thing.I think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East.When I raise money – excuse me, excuse me, I’ve watched you on television.Frankly, I have a lot of friends that aren’t Christian.Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book "The Art of the Deal" and the other books we’ve done.They donâ€™t know if itâ€™s true or false because theyâ€™re not involved.He had no idea, and yet he knew what it could be.You know, one of the things I’m most honored about is that so far everybody that’s attacked me has gone down the tubes.They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now theyâ€™re willing to talk trade.It’s so preposterous.They’re dying while they wait on line.AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.A lot – so much has happened.Bad stuff is happening.You saw in Nevada, I won in the poll, the Hispanic vote.I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what weâ€™re doing is weâ€™re talking about the power structure, weâ€™re talking about its entrenchment.And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.Thatâ€™s a lot of hands.Then I get people screaming at me.THE PRESIDENT:  He was a great student in law.But I’m very surprised at this statement.His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.The wall is going to cost $10 billion.We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what’s happening.And he tells me all the time â€” I called him up the other day.Look, we have a situation that is out of control.That’s the way it’s going to be.Not going to happen.I’ve been with Israel so long in terms of, I’ve received some of my greatest honors from Israel.It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.Big difference.We will not let it happen.Who got it?"Iâ€™m going to try.No longer will we accept a broken system that benefits consultants and lobbyists at the expense of hardworking Americans.You can’t use it because the deductibility is so high.I can go â€” our general; Iâ€™ll have our general.I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals:  To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen

Welcome to all of you deplorables.Q    Who are the good people?President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic.That could have been years ago.And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix.THE PRESIDENT: That was very professional and very good.THE PRESIDENT:  We have evidence.That I can tell you.Because I’m a great builder.Itâ€™s been very much of a one-way street.They have thousands of employees.And I think we did a very good job.Get rid of regulations.I mean, a big chunk of the country is like that because we’re tired of stupidity.That is the future I want for America â€” a nation where we are proud, prosperous, united, and free.(Applause.)Okay.They were, during the good oil days — now it’s probably half, which is fine.Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the motherâ€™s womb moments from birth.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think youâ€™ve seen that.It’s not like two days before or the day after.YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY.AND THE REASON THEY SIGNED THE PLEDGE WAS TO GET ME TO SIGN IT.Now they â€” I know we had a lot of vets here.I have done so many deals.Okay?You know, I know a lot of tough people but they’re not smart.We’re going to turn this country around and we’re going to be the smart people.And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses.Iâ€™m in no rush for speed.Nobody else will be able to do it.But now, we’re really focused on security and I’m honored because I will tell you that all of polls and the CNN polls where said in particular that Trump is just not by a little bit but by many, many percentage points winning on ISIS, winning on the military, winning with the vets.The veterans.Every time this guy, you know, raises his head, we see our ships start to sail, our soldiers get ready.They’re still trying to recover.Wait until you see whatâ€™s coming, folks.We have to take care of our vets.And we haven’t won.No, no, you have to use it to your advantage.The oil companies give him a lot of money.And they want to take care of their families, always their families.They buy condos for tens of millions of dollars.He’s still a great quarterback.We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.He’s a friend of mine but he’s not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today.And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.So with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out.They’re never going to be able to do it.Then they’d go back to fight.It’s amazing.And thatâ€™s just the beginning.USA!You saw that horrible budget.I want to wait until I meet with Bibi.Itâ€™s already happening, but big league.Just rely on me.It went on for a long time.No greater honor.I heard somebody on a certain network last night â€” I wonâ€™t mention which one â€” say, â€œWhy has President Trump given so much to North Korea?â€  I said, â€œWait a minute.â€  I asked Sarah Huckabee, â€œPlease call this person.â€  I gave nothing â€” other than I met.â€œWe are going to attack Mosul in four months.â€ Then three months later: â€œWe are going to attack Mosul in one month.â€ â€œNext week, we are going to attack Mosul.â€ In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year.But the concept of the PAC is no good.There was a picture in Time magazine.Everybody says it.And they say, "He’s not a – " Remember Jeb Bush?They said, "He was serious!"No, no, nobody ever talks about that.We canâ€™t have that.No, it’s not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it’s going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation.I love Florida and I’m there a lot.I want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarah’s husband.They — we don’t even get our prisoners back.And in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, theyâ€™re raising rates because weâ€™ve never done like weâ€™re doing now.Itâ€™s time.And you know what?So, we wrote a letter – a legal letter – to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don’t want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it?And then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like.Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing.ISIS beats us.I say, "No, thank you."LOU, LOU HOLTS.They enslave women, and they murder gays.The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.Weâ€™re going to be leveling the playing field.Now, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen.My job is to represent the United States of America.The ink isn’t even dry and now he’s finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and it’s only going to get worse.Hey, I’m not saying they’re stupid.Obamacare is a total catastrophe.That won’t happen with me.It has to make us safer as a nation.That’s the one thing…I know isn’t.They’re buying our coal and they’re using it.It could have been one notch better.Q    That is â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  And, of the three or four, theyâ€™re all negative.The Republicans have tremendous energy.Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it’s too much.The real number.His daughter works for Hillary Clinton.Do not take our country down with your party.So, if anybody has – [applause] – thank you.THE PRESIDENT:  Itâ€™s true.See, he lied about â€” he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.This is a great feeling.And now since this happened" — it’s up in the prison area — "my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns.I always that people like that – there aren’t many – but it’s called tough, smart, and they know how to win.American hands will rebuild this nation.Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result.And one more thing.I want people with great talent to come into the United States.So I think when you really look at it all, itâ€™s not going to change any of the Democratsâ€™ minds.But our new people are going in.I do know about the lawyer.I watched you on television tonight.We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now it’s actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt.But the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this.Iâ€™m proud of that.But it was heroin.One of the guys I’d definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China.We were being caught by China.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.I mean, the toughest guy, the toughest woman.I love the Tea Party.Can’t do it.She has one of the most incredible spirits that I’ve ever seen.Might even be over 50% if I analyze it.Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years â€” really, soon to be historic.And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds.It’s going to get worse and worse folks.And we’re going to hand them out right now to the press.And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning.I love kids.Hey, who is better than me?But it sort of tells me when I first said this people would say, "Oh, it will cost a lot."We’ve got to figure it out.Q    No, you interrupted my question.Would you believe it?Totally ...






 Common core is gone.It was great.You have to be able to get people into your office.At my direction, the United States military eliminated the worldâ€™s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.This was about four weeks ago, I put that out.You started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage.I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say â€œFox & Friendsâ€ in the morning, theyâ€™re very honorable people.He just put in a big order for Komatsu.We have no choice.In this building, in Trump Tower.He really didnâ€™t think â€” it was really what happened after that, but he didnâ€™t think anything was done wrong.And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.He’s going to sell it now at a big loss.NOW HE'S SAYING WE'LL NEVER PAY FOR THE WALL.Is that what we want to do?They get big, fat salaries.I understand that you’re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you’re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."We’re very different people.Q    Sir, the message to young men?Whoa.And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't.Many of these areas have still never recovered.THEY FELT SO BADLY.So it really does – and more than anything else, it’s also speaking to other veterans.Letâ€™s go.BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.(Applause.)WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS, WHICH WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.I would like to go â€” yes, go ahead.And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.And I like China.How much of that money do you think he’s going to use to do what he’s supposed to be doing?They come to your office.So, I call up.Maybe not.It’s important.You can call it murder.Excuse me.We’ve gotten the nomination.Unless I don’t know is there something going on that we don’t know about?Okay, that’s fine.I’d take 44% if we had three people.And there’s no greater honor.I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that.So a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff.They really like Trump.(Applause.)That’s when we become Greece.Now, what would I say good about Mitt Romney?FAR WORSE.We have so much money, we donâ€™t know what to do with it.Okay, sit down.It’s a ramp — a little ramp that goes over the wall.Our jails are over-brimming.He leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers.And you know what?You've got these people coming, half of them are criminals.If we ever say, "Listen, if you’re not going to treat us fairly, we don’t want your cars anymore", they’d go out of business, folks, they’re gone.I didn’t expect to do so well.Trump National Golf Club.And they said I was the only celebrity.He said it’s virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do.And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts.Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon the Washington Post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don’t exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years!I said, cancel everybody else.This is not from Mexico.They want to blow our cities up.Theyâ€™re coming back to our country.Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.Because of the Environmental Protection Agency, they couldn’t get an environmental impact study approved.But weâ€™re going to do great things.And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children â€” born and unborn â€” are made in the holy image of God.Q    â€” of interfering in our internal affairs â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s right.Just like Cruz started the last deal.It’s been amazing.Believe me.And then you have the devaluation with China.Iâ€™d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.And you know, it’s interesting, but the debates — OK.You know, much of this money was paid out fairly early.Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done.Members of Congress: The state of our union is strong.Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin.But, ultimately â€” but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them.No, I heard she was a couple of hours late.A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength.They gave false quotes.â€  And they went on a lot of shows.For instance, if I say "Carl, do me a favor.It’s tough.We’re going to take care of our African American people that have been mistreated for so long.Remember that.But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks.Aye, it was so beautiful.Okay?But we’re going to have to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals.Believe me.IT'S BEEN A SPECIAL PLACE AND YOU'RE SPECIAL PEOPLE....For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel, and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.Thatâ€™s Mr. Manafort, whoâ€™s, by the way â€” whoâ€™s, by the way, a respected man.So unexpected.And if it works out, that’s great.Okay?Here we go.And I will say this, my father is an incredibly hard worker and he'll be working for each and every one of you.To a fault I’m loyal.Look, let me tell you, they – many of them kill themselves waiting for a doctor.Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence.They’re not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody.One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it.I was in South Carolina.And we left.He did it.The whole world is like a different place.No, Ted’s a good guy.We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free.Said it the first time in Iowa.Veteran:
Thank you, Mr. Trump.Why would politicians want to change a system that’s totally rigged in order to keep them in power?Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.Right?Jacksonâ€™s life was devoted to one very crucial principle â€” he understood that real leadership means putting America first.Okay.But they’re not actually that dumb.Even CNN doesn’t report it.Have a good time.She’s back there.Thank you.Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world.I could be persuaded also.This is an exact quote.We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do.SO THOSE TWO THINGS.Right?That’s good.But the people are great.He wasn’t a cheerleader; he was the opposite.Right now, weâ€™re in a great position.I watched the ex-president of Mexico, the arrogance of this man.It’s very average.And I said to myself, you know â€” and I said to somebody that was in the room â€” I said, you take a look at Reince, heâ€™s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.Thatâ€™s what it would be with us, too.I don’t get Lindsey Graham.I mean, we won the election, right?But I donâ€™t watch CNN so I donâ€™t get to see you as much as I want to.I think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in New York.So here’s what happened.They’re going to take away thousands of jobs.And I appreciate your understanding on that.The banks are controlled by the regulators.They are being destroyed.We have very different qualities and we are extremely different.So he’ll be out quickly, I guess.YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted?And think of this: We owe China $1.4 trillion and we’re paying them interest.Itâ€™s still massive numbers of crossings.In the first two job reports since I took the oath of office, weâ€™ve already added nearly half a million new jobs, and believe me, itâ€™s just beginning.And now they’re doing it here.Q    I was there.I think it’s much more than that.No, no, think of it.Use the name Bush.Big.And although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on.This is about common sense.And it’s just not going to work.It’s great.She has the address, has the date.But weâ€™ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.Good.(Applause.)Think of it.Itâ€™s unheard of.You like to win.Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.We’ve got a lot of problems.Theyâ€™re not in love with me.(Applause.)So Jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo.To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild.But if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn’t you start screaming or something?I got elected on defense of our country.Q    Could you share those stats with us?So, congratulations.And whether we go -- honestly whether we go to Dallas or whether we go anywhere you say -- you go to L.A. -- you go anywhere you say.I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay.Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen.Wow.And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times â€” I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times.And then we saw the tapes.They’ve actually taken their right of free speech away.It’s going to be repealed.They cannot believe how stupid our government is.So I just want to pay my respects to Ben.Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things â€” beautiful things â€” for our country.They find a way.Obviously, it didn’t work too well.By the way, mostly false.So I donâ€™t want it competing and hurting the decision â€” one way or the other decision.This is where we’re going.Remember?Oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in Nashville?And just, you know, he’s a Mexican-American, and you because of your efforts have sent him to college.There are a lot of good people.I have never seen — it looked like the Academy Awards, the press.George Will said there’s a company in South Carolina that makes television.(Applause.)I think we're going to do very well.You know, it’s too bad there wasn’t another way.It canâ€™t get any worse, the crime, the jobs.And he’s got a great future.Let’s see, I’m in my room in New York City and I want to put a little spray so that I can —










— right?That’s the end of it.We have tremendous people.When I say progressive, I mean like smart.She was great.The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK?That’s what we need, not these hacks that we have.Beautiful picture of something.I think itâ€™s a great question.We had a big, big victory in New Hampshire.Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK?It’s the cheapest thing you can do.I have Jerry Falwell Jr. from Liberty University.He was supposed to win.They want their immigration laws enforced and their border secured.But if I get in, I will straighten it out, believe me.YOU KNOW THAT DEAL VERY WELL.But our leaders are doing a bad job for us.When are we going to get smart?Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years.I’ve fought for my family.(Applause.)Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families.Q    And he said â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Who is â€” you mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good healthcare?Iâ€™m proud of him.Saudi Arabia, until the oil went down and now they’re still making a fortune.Would you like to be recognized as â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I wouldnâ€™t say that socialism has bene working really well around the world, okay.What I really have is a great number of people.Q    (Laughs.)Rush Limbaugh said "He has received more incoming than any human being I’ve ever seen."I’ve received many, many awards.CNN was going to get $2,000 for a 30 second ad.They don’t even know what they’re there for.The relationship there to the people...Bush is 1% in Nevada.In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican
government.Number two isn’t even close.I’ve fought for my business.How bad is that?We’re going to be the smart people.That was the surge....I really do.I love their team, by the way.I want them to come back legally.A PPP poll.Now â€”

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Steven, Wilbur, Gary, Robert, even my General and my various other generals, you know.I want to thank you very, very much.Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges.You could say there’s 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases.Q    Thank you very much for your time, Mr. President.So, I’m going forward.Turn off the television.It’s not like very important to me anymore.We had a meeting.And then they called.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think itâ€™s different.Hopefully it’s he in this case.I am.But I learned a lot.They got tired.So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans.So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened.You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice.Almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular Mexico.Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation â€” itâ€™s great wealth, itâ€™s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth â€” and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.We love our vets and they're being treated terribly.Q    When will you be reaching out?And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.And I think it’s going to be very instructional, very important.Before becoming President, Andrew Jackson served your state from the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and he also served as commander of the Tennessee militia.Q    But you said that you donâ€™t feel â€” but you said that you feel like there have been numerous false allegations against you, and that because of thatâ€“

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, Iâ€™ve had many false â€”

Q    â€” you feel that you understand what he might be going through.Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for.After a full ...That was a disgrace.She wanted to be here.Now, the people in charge say things can’t change.WE'RE LOSING ON THE BORDER.We can’t be.I said, "What’s your problem?"I see tone.I said I’ll do it and if it costs more than $2 million I’ll pay for it.Like they have never seen.I came up with that term, it became so defining.One of the best in the country.Too much.They didn’t turn them in.When I raise money for the veterans and it’s a massive amount of money – find out how much Hillary Clinton has given to the veterans – nothing.We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control.These politicians – here’s a guy, he raises the Bible and yet he tells fibs, he tells lies, and then he does this stuff to Carson and he does other things.I’m giving them away.WE PRAY FOR ALL THE WOUNDED SURVIVORS.They want jobs.I said, "I don’t need it.Donald Trump is doing this with a heart.We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.I want every American to succeed.Itâ€™s $350 billion.â€  I said, that is something.And there’s no loyalty.As our thoughts and prayers remain firmly with the citizens and our fellow people â€” people â€” great, great people â€” all affected by this tragedy.I KEPT WAITING FOR THE WHOLE DELEGATION, I KEPT WAITING FOR THEM TO LEAVE, TO GET UP AND LEAVE.It’s not going to — except for Chris Christie, of course.Our country has no gravitas.Because there is a question:  Is it murder?Letâ€™s go.We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens an American job.Nobody.He didn’t like it because he didn’t want to be shown up.AND BY THE WAY, WHEN OUR ENEMIES ALL OVER THE WORLD, INCLUDING OUR FRIENDS ALL OVER THE WORLD LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY, WHERE THE OTHER NIGHT YOU HAD 11, THINK OF IT, 11 CITIES POTENTIALLY IN A BLOWUP STAGE.Right?Cars, theyâ€™re at 25 percent.He had that election won.You’re going to be so sick of me.But we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated.I watched the sister being interviewed.He didn’t know.SUCH NICE PEOPLE.When do we beat Mexico at the border?Now, our president doesn’t want to use the term – we had another event, which probably was – the one yesterday – probably was related.Women don’t like Hillary.There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.And as you know, that’s what I’ve wanted.No, no, the illegal immigrants in many cases…are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have – our wounded warriors are – these are the greatest people we have.Theyâ€™re incredible people.She’s talking about — I mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, I think one of the reasons I have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today — less money than they made 12 years ago.And we’re going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and they’re not coming back and I don’t want to put them in our jails because I don’t want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years.By the way, I think I’m going to win the Hispanic vote and I think – you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll.But okay.They want Saudi Arabia.We’re using the greatest business people in the world and we have them in this country and they’re endorsing me, and I know the best ones from the not so great ones.We could not figure you out.No direction.And she knows that we’re going to take care of our people, and it’s going to be America first.We have to make our military so strong.THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and theyâ€™re in position.But he used to say, "Donald, don’t go into Manhattan.(Applause.)Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.I brought them here.20 YEARS AGO, IT WAS BANG, BUT SLOWLY.Most people don’t even know what the agreement says.I love this place.Elton John said, â€œWhen you hit that last tune and itâ€™s good, donâ€™t go back.â€  (Laughter.)The thing is he didnâ€™t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didnâ€™t remember.I didn’t do anything like – I didn’t do anything.A new Rasmussen poll, in fact â€” because the people get it; much of the media doesnâ€™t get it.And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved â€” weeks late, I have to say that.I don’t see that necessarily.The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement â€” they went wild; they were so happy â€” for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.And illegal immigration was such a big subject.And then the lies happened.I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that â€” whoever.And I want to thank Barron.So that’s a great.Boom!"And we’ve seen it.People who warn about radical Islamic terrorism are not Islamophobes.But – so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and that’s the beginning.(Applause.)That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.Lots of great things would happen.You saw him.ONE OF THE PEOPLE STANDING RIGHT THERE, SAID TO ME, MR. TRUMP, ARE YOU AN ISOLATIONIST, AND MR. TRUMP -- AND I SAID NO.TOUGH.And somebody thought it was an earthquake.(Applause.)I didn’t receive one letter, not one letter from one governor.If you don’t know Drudge — Matt Drudge.Heâ€™s a good person.Our theme which I love may be the greatest theme of all time, right?Rebuild the country’s infrastructure.I really am.You’re going to hurt this.And Iâ€™m putting in my money.So all of these things.It's not going to happen anymore, folks.But I will say that they said â€” it was very interesting â€” that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King.He’s the worst.And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?We’re not going to use the special interest guy – a donor.No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay.But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.That’s what we need in our country.Well, weâ€™re giving her a time.THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™ve had many false statements against me.And sometimes Iâ€™ll say, wow, thatâ€™s going to be a great story, and Iâ€™ll get killed.There’s no documentation.So with Obama, when he announces that we’re leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldn’t have been there but once you announced the bad guys – you know how they say the surge worked?One of the best-selling, all-time, and I mean seriously, I’m saying ‘one of’, because I’ll be criticized as though I say ‘the’, so I’m going to be very diplomatic.Hey, I have lobbyists.Look â€”

(Cross-talk.)Okay?I love the people.Itâ€™s been a little over 50 days since my inauguration, and weâ€™ve been putting our America First agenda very much into action.I started talking to people, and I started saying the good and the bad and the ugly.It’s been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof.I am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.In Nevada, I’m number one.Billions of dollars has been paid to them.So I won’t be influenced by the lobbies and you know et cetera, et cetera.So, we’re going to take back our trade.Except for the Times.How much longer is it going to last?Of course, the worldâ€™s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.You know that.They asked me for a $1 million.You wouldn’t had that carnage.Go ahead.He said, "You’ve totally changed the landscape of politics; it’s forever going to be different.MR. SCHWAB:  Now my, maybe personal, question would be: What experience from your past have been most useful in preparing you for the Presidency?An embarrassment to our country and it’s horrible.They’re stupid people.Our vets are treated horribly.And I look at it – I’m very good – I can look at a building and tell you how much it’s going to cost.Well, I just think, you know, I’m just happy with the way we’re doing.What are you going to do about it?Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China.We’ll have plenty – we’ll talk a lot about ISIS.The imbalance is so bad.They're going to build them in Michigan.If you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you could take the best person in this room, the most qualified, you’re not going to do it.And they asked, "Is there anger from your people?"You know, they never; they have me.They pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars.And we had ice skating in Central Park and I still run it.And I know how tough it is.We have the highest — we’re the highest taxed nation in the world.I’m honored by that.You know, I get a kick.Georgia, Texas.And I don’t.This will all change when I become president.Itâ€™s a lot of murders, but itâ€™s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico.We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE.But steel is incredible.Big poll.The banks have money.Itâ€™s a great honor to know you, Jerry.And she does not have the energy.Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.He got in there, he said, "I shouldn’t have done this.And you brought up, actually, that you support a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis there.He understands it takes two people to be happy â€” two groups of people to be happy.It shouldâ€™ve been better.â€  And you know what?And with the veterans when they’re waiting for exorbitant time – even for a little time – they’re going to go to the doctor.This is not just a national security issue.They don’t have a clue.Even you will be very proud of me as a president.In other words, like I say that, you applaud, I start talking you finish your Applause.You do know that.How about two more, and weâ€™ll call it?I mean, you give money and they get a cut.So, so important.I don’t care about the establishment.But the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office.Not much.Thereâ€™s been no â€” other than maybe that, but even that.Is there a second?Theyâ€™re trying to figure it all out because this has never happened to them before.The second part I won’t bother asking you.And I was responsible â€” and I hope it stays that way â€” when I put out on social media, a few weeks ago, about Idlib Province.I’m not going to cut it at all; I’m going to bring money in, and we’re going to save it.Thank you very much.Those are criminal leaks.Now, I don’t know if I did or not but I certainly didn’t do badly.He was there.That’s like a magic act.We gave them Iraq, that they’ve been after for 100 years.Right up these elevators.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, letâ€™s go.And that’s not what I said.We’ve become like a third world nation because we’re fighting everybody else’s battles.Record, record, record.So I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching.We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries.I said to President Zelensky:  â€œI would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.â€  I said do us a favor, not me, and our country, not a campaign.Okay?Other groups received $200,000, $250,000.We’re going to do so good on the border.So 62% with two people is a massive landslide.Don’t.(Laughter.)WE HAD SO MANY COACHES THAT CAME OUT IN OUR FAVOR.We must keep freedom alive in our souls.Ben Carson, who endorsed me by the way, is a great guy, and Lyin’ Ted, remember in Iowa, he said "Ben has left the race.And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room â€” every step of the way.I mean, honestly, you know Jared is a very successful real estate person but I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate.I said, "I don’t know."Millions of people would have been killed.People are angry.And then they’re all down.You know, weâ€™re doing much better than I had projected in terms of â€” when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and weâ€™re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.If we do this, if we unite in the name of common sense and the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and we will give America the competitive advantage that it so desperately needs and has been looking for for so long.The answer is:  You donâ€™t.They didn’t say I’m doing great.Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another – from NAFTA to China to South Korea.One: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.Started with 17 people.I love China.He said, "I’m going to give it to another candidate."They’d have dinner together.Oh, boy â€” no talk, all action, right?Is that OK to put it on?That won’t happen, I can guarantee you, with a President Trump."No, sir, $3 billion."Since its founding, the Republican Party has been a party of builders.Yeah, I would.We want them to build them in Michigan.I said, "What?I’m looking up for lots of trouble.Millions of people are coming in to vote.We’ve got to keep it that way, right?I think he was ready to go to war.And we’re going to have great, great trade deals.But now it starts to go up quickly.We’re not going to let this happen anymore.How stupid are they?I mean, they allowed – in one night, that first night in Baltimore – they allowed that city to be destroyed.But I like the fact that he was fighting, fighting, he was always fighting.They’d been in trouble.Now, I could put less pressure on myself and I could say, "Oh, I don’t care about Iowa.They were laughing with me.He’s a great reporter.Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption.And her name is Beada and she’s become very famous.Me?So I want to thank everybody for being here.Nothing can be as bad as NAFTA.We have nothing.BUT I CALL HIM THE FIVE-FOR-ONE.(Applause.)THROUGH THE CAMERAMAN'S LEGS, UP AROUND HIS ANKLES.Youâ€™re changing culture.We can’t get jobs."We didn’t win anything.No good.So I call him and I say Chuck, let me explain something.You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not.And toward the end, it was like I didn’t want to leave.I do this for a living.I say, "Wouldn’t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just..." And then they drive over it with jeeps loaded up with drugs.We are going to build our military which I thank because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits in Washington I -- we love our military.You don’t get better, and the crowds got bigger and bigger.46% were the Hispanics—46%, No.Okay.So that was enough.Itâ€™s going extremely well.People who support the police, who want crime reduced and ended, and who are not prejudiced.I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.So I do his show, he gets the highest ratings he’s had in years.I’m in for a lot of money.Donâ€™t forget, thatâ€™s their territory.A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.I would have had a hard time.That’s what I want.It's not going to happen anymore.AND I SAID TO THEM, WHEN THEY CALLED ME TO TELL ME ABOUT THE ENDORSEMENT, NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, THEY'VE NEVER ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE, 16,500, GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE AND I SAID TO THEM, SO LET ME TELL YOU, I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION -- HOW IMPORTANT IS THE WALL?They want the borders.Very, very importantly, and they want the Second Amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and that’s going to happen.I bought it very inexpensively many years ago – 15 years ago – and because of the fact that they thought I was against this woman or that one, I had a hard time with television.Theyâ€™re fighting for other people because they donâ€™t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.Believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody.Right?Okay?THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.Don’t forget, I was the fair-haired boy.And hat is it.But — and I used to say it’s the worst deal that I’ve ever seen negotiated.By the way, you talk about low energy.That's all he does, is build plants.I said very nicely – I’m not a bad person – I said nicely "No, thank you."We’re going to find out.THEY ARE DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES, BY THE DOZENS, AT A TIME.But what are you going to do?USA!And they said – and they add them up and they show a graph that goes much higher than mine and it’s much lower than mine.I say fan the crowd just to show – look at all the people over here.All of a sudden they’re working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better.And we’ve actually expanded the party.It’s not easy, believe me.You send people out.We have another one that we havenâ€™t been able to break up yet.THEY CAN'T STAND IT.I think weâ€™re going to make a deal.I think weâ€™re really going to do something thatâ€™s going to be very important.But we’re going to go on and we’re going to win.I watch them.And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.And they said, thatâ€™s a good idea.I have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples’ great spirit.It’s been pretty tough.It always happens but it probably was.We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.THAT DEAL WAS SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON.So what did we get – $2 trillion.BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET CARRIER COME IN AND MAKE AIR-CONDITIONERS IN MEXICO AND SELL THE AIR-CONDITIONERS TO US, ACROSS A VERY STRONG BORDER NOW, WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.So, weâ€™re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.Probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to, signed in the history of the world, not in the United States.I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support – the only way you could have done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic, on track to win 37 primary/caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.And everybody laughed at me.I feel very foolish.Mexico is beating us at the border and on trade.You know it’s NBC so somebody picks it up.We're going to go reverse it.I have a friend who’s a great manufacturer.Where the hell is she?: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them.(Applause.)They’re the ones that caused it.Then you had those two sleaze bags from California.And Iâ€™ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.Lot of people donâ€™t know that.They have it set.It’s ridiculous.And itâ€™s not easy, I want to tell you.You and your party are desperate to distract from Americaâ€™s extraordinary economy, incredible jobs boom, record stock market, soaring confidence, and flourishing citizens.No, no, I do that.India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.I have unlimited, I have unlimited – you know, it’s funny.There was no such word.But I sold it and I built it to really a great company.I mean, I own some of the great properties in the world.AND I ALWAYS SAY, DIDN'T YOU SEE IT?Thank you very much.She said, "Well, they never leave your face."I have more accountants than I have nurses.You have these countries are the best in terms of education and they’re on the list the best.Believe me.That’s the negotiator we have.They don’t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.Achilles International – great organization – $200,000.I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately.San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country.Tremendous cash flow.I don’t want it.Don’t forget.They won’t be able to do what I do.Prosperous again.Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another.She's totally owned by Wall Street.I thought.Fantastic.And itâ€™s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices.Sir, I have the man â€” General Kelly.I really believe he wants to get it done.So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.And it was right there.It is time to believe in each other.I don’t know.I want nothing.Look, we’re doing so well.I’ve got some of the greatest deal makers in the world.We love Florida so.Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.I have to go through – you know, you have to watch to make sure that the contractors aren’t stealing and ripping you off and everything else.They build ramps.The reason is I’m going to bring jobs back.First of all, do you think these women â€” all three of them are liars?They know that he was bad.Wow, sheâ€™s so â€” sheâ€™s become a tremendous star.We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom Iâ€™ve read about for years.Thank you.And other people – you know, vets have endorsed me virtually unanimously and a lot of the vets will come up to me and say, "You know, Mr. Trump, we follow closely what’s going on.THEY KEEP THOSE CAMERAS ON MY FACE, THEY NEVER TAKE THE CAMERAS OFF MY FACE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE -- I WISH THEY WOULD TURN THE CAMERAS OVER HERE.Now, perhaps – perhaps – somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps...we’ll have some really good Attorney General that’s going to say "Well, you know".Itâ€™s the Americans!â€  (Applause.)We didn’t talk about devaluations.THIS IS WHERE YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM -- LOOK AT THE CEILINGS.We had fun.Women are very angry.(Applause.)They don’t do that.I’ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges, and I’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours.So maybe they donâ€™t have the influence they think, but they really are â€” they really have to straighten out their act.This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit.The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill.You know why?It's very simple.And when Chris called, he said this is a movement; this is something like I’ve never seen.Nobody questions ...I knew it.This is not about religion â€“ this is about terror and keeping our country safe.We’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again.(Applause.)Inner cities.But the whole â€” my life, Iâ€™ve always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, thatâ€™s like the toughest deal.But it was Paris.The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history.Right?Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country.So, it’s not up the United Nations to go with a solution.It’s so easy.So it’s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight.Also, also the people of Iowa.The donor now is Carl Icahn.Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive trade deficits â€” numbers that you would not believe.â€œWeâ€™re not doing well.And also, weâ€™re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime.WE'RE WINNING ON EDUCATION.Q    When these allegations were raised, why didnâ€™t this White House do the same thing?Itâ€™s very, very rough.But, you know, we have something thatâ€™s amazing because we had â€” it looked â€” honestly, it looked like a million and a half people.Donâ€™t forget, itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ve done this for â€” a senator came into my office and said, â€œSir, Iâ€™ve been running for office for 30 years.If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.These Departments refused to comply.They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.Weâ€™re also taking decisive action to improve our vetting procedures.Remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house?So if I would have left a couple of days early, I think I would have won Florida the same.Thatâ€™s where we were heading.We protect as an example South Korea, who have a maniac right next to them.People respect â€” you know, they respect that military sense.Their lives are just destroyed.But I just wanted to pay my respects by the way to Todd.And you know, it’s always tough when you’re on live television all the time.In fact, I’d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo?How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?We protect Japan.Carl, do me a favor.And the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes – headlines the next day – "Trump doesn’t want NATO, wants to disband NATO".Hey, Trace Adkins – right?And everybody – they’re much bigger.I said, "Not at all.We have no choice.Uh, let me call the Russians to help.â€  Does anybody really believe that?That’s common sense.Boy, he is bad.Itâ€™s going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the veterans.He’s a good guy.And (inaudible).Hillary’s debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was – oh – it was – you couldn’t watch it.Itâ€™s actually a little tougher deal.Same thing with Australia.The fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade.Well, I’ll tell you in all fairness, Ben Carson said yesterday or the other day that he wants to abolish Medicare.Thank you.We got to change this deal.Nobody better than Jeff.The Iran deal is the worst deal I’ve ever seen negotiated, OK?Why do they fight?I can tell you.What are we get out of this?And a couple of the ones and zeroes – they’re the ones that hit the hardest.Itâ€™s so sad.You know, this whole thing with all of these guys.You know, just so you understand, Bush – Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me.They will be proud again.Tremendous net worth.If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?So you have spent three straight years attempting to overturn the will of the American people and nullify their votes.A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve.But let me just tell you we lose so much money with Mexico in terms of trade imbalance – $45 billion last year.We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil.And I think it will be an amazing boon.You know, people talk about the Tea Party and you talk about marginalizing, at least I have a microphone where I can fight back.You know, I’m a Republican.Just so you understand…He’s not going to win and neither is she…
Well, she’s being totally protected because in theory she shouldn’t even be allowed to run.We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.And I said, â€œOh, I didnâ€™t know there thereâ€™d be that kindâ€¦â€  They werenâ€™t laughing at me.ISIS has spread like cancer.I want clean.And I had no idea that we’d have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff Mitt Romney – a total stiff – who by the way he’s a dope.We got it.So we’re going to get efficiency in government.So I filed and everyone said "Oh, I can’t believe it."They had 3,000 people outside that couldn’t get in.So the enemy all of sudden said, "Wow", ‘cause don’t believe it.Not going to happen anymore.We don’t know."Some I think are horrible people.As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs.I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I’m going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal.And Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a clue.And I say fan it and they never ever fan it.And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.We need spirit.And every citizen of this country.But it doesn’t really cover terrorism like it’s supposed to.John Rich.And they add them up and they say "Well, he’s worth $2.9 billion."From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you’re talking about millions and millions of returns.Iâ€™m going to lower your taxes so substantially.And I’ll tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values.Nobody talks about that.We want peace, wherever peace can be found.(Applause.)You know, they say Iâ€™m close to Russia.And you know what?Mick is with us now.WE HAVE CROWDS LIKE THIS EVERYWHERE, NO MATTER WHERE WE GO.I wish I would have devoted two more days to Ohio because I almost won in Ohio.They didn’t talk about any of the problems.We have to admit, still the New York Times.But it doesn’t amount to a lot.You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they donâ€™t have time to come in.We’re going to take care of our veterans.We have great respect for you.So I said, "The people of the country can’t be that stupid."So I want to bring education back to the local areas.It was brutal.If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesnâ€™t matter.Because if we could get along with Russia â€” and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone â€” if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.Thatâ€™s far back.I said, "Who are they?"I think people are going to be very happy.And I have a lot of respect from Mexico, and you just heard we won Hispanics.Somebody bought an airplane in China here.Bush, it’s the same thing.Here’s a nice one, you’re number one, they give you a secret service.I’ve done a great job.If you truly cared about freedom and liberty for our Nation, then you would be devoting your vast investigative resources to exposing the full truth concerning the FBIâ€™s horrifying abuses of power before, during, and after the 2016 electionâ€”including the use of spies against my campaign, the submission of false evidence to a FISA court, and the concealment of exculpatory evidence in order to frame the innocent.We will make America truly great again.It’s a small amount of money compared to what I put in.WE'RE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.I love the Saudis.I thought he was going to vote for Obama.Well, they couldn’t find it because what have they done that’s good?And I have to explain to these people they don’t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it.WE'RE GOING TO SAY NO.He said, "Donald, what you’ve got is a movement."Do you have your pad?Number one.No, but we don’t have that invite.But the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal.The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists.So let me just before we talk some questions, I’m going to talk about something I’ve never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it.Weâ€™re going to fix it.They said – well, I won’t use the candidates’ name because I don’t want to insult any candidate when they can’t defend themselves.Israel does not name public squares after terrorists.We’re going to win.China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.Believe me, I’m not going to forget it.I want to bring tremendous wealth into this country.The most powerful guns.In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and theyâ€™re not happy about it for whatever reason.Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country.So he goes the Clinton campaign said they’d most like to run against Trump, like I’m some kind of a sap.(Applause.)They were saying "This deal is unbelievable."Q    Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely her or her parents would have reported it.But I want to say that there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump.And the penalty is death.I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities.We get the drugs.They pay peanuts for what we do.But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too.Many of the hospitals are dying for business.We’re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess.I am proud to honor this heritage, and weâ€™ll be honoring it more and more.Weâ€™re all on the same wavelength, right?You know, iconic.I don’t know why.I did.I say "You know, I don’t want to talk – I have a real chance of winning.I don’t know how they’re doing this but they do it.Thereâ€™s no racist.I won’t bring anybody up.And I got it and we’re building this phenomenal hotel – Trump International Hotel – right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House.The only bad news, I can’t get her on Saturday.I talk about how we’re losing our jobs to all of these different countries.You know, the great champions.But I think at some point it’s going to get done.He didn’t know why he was there.He didn’t say Mexico was going to pay was going to pay.Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world.We have absolutely nothing.The Hispanics have been so incredible to me.But these geniuses -- they're geniuses -- they don't understand that as people drop out I'm going to get a lot of those votes also.No matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home.He wants somebody that knows what they’re doing.Then I said, "Where does it come from?"(Laughter.)So they went from $2,000 to $250,000 for a 30 second ad.And that is â€” you can call it terrorism.Weâ€™re here today to launch our plans to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers.They’re not sending you.We are going to get rid of it.He’s a very smart guy, I want to tell you.Now, it’s called corporate inversion.Wow.I hate even the question because people that know me â€” and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday â€” did you hear him, Bibi?They werenâ€™t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call.It will be a real wall.So, I mentioned it, Hillary is a disaster.And I thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up.Nobody knows the system better than me.I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.I gave â€” you know what I gave to Russia?We wish them well.Do you agree with that?See?Thank you.At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.(Applause.)And it was never even touched.Well, the same thing I figured with cameras.And they're getting away with it.And then the other day, one of the people said — it was Ted Cruz, who is a nice guy.It’s totally under siege.WE'RE STOPPING DRUGS FROM POURING IN.Go ahead.Maybe it is.Just many – Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things…
And the reason I bring that up is because that’s the kind of thinking we need.Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night â€” great companies.By the way, I’m the only one that’s self-funding my campaign.Mine are made in America.(Applause.)I’ll never say bad about him.When you stop looking for a job, you’re considered statistically employed.And it's always bad, down, down, down.So I’m at 41% with 17 people and they said "Trump’s at 41% but look" – you can’t even hear it.I mean, think about it.We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal.And it was a horrible thing to watch.So we’re doing great.I didnâ€™t know him.We’ve got to be a country again.And I said, "Who the hell is he?[Audience: "Mexico"]
You better believe it.Don’t forget.We got to pull our country together.They want money.He’s tough.It’s going to be defeated.And then you know they were tougher in those days.But a lot of them — Samsung, all of them.I love that.The whole country.This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.Q President Obama, 332.And I don’t mean by number one.I just don’t know.We have great people.But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of years and everybody left you alone.This overregulated permitting process is a massive self-inflicted wound on our country â€” itâ€™s disgraceful â€” denying our people much-needed investments in their community.Christianity.It’s ridiculous.SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.And just a few notes.Rely.Thank you."I like you best but I’m going to go someplace else."What he did was – he stole.Do you think General George Patton – they don’t like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy.It’s great.Seriously.And this is my wheelhouse.In fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000.I want to use our jails for people that are supposed to be there.The male shooter in San Bernardino – again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.I called him.I have a natural instinct for this stuff.You know, maybe we should do that.A big tax reduction, including for the upper income.We've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.And I don’t like it.He’s tough as nails.I love polls.We got to stop those drugs, though.Come here, come on, get up here, Steve.People that you would have never thought possible are now saying, "I support Trump."Right?We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.So new polls have just come in.I donâ€™t have to tell you what Iâ€™m going to do in North Korea.Q    And do you â€” wait a minute.Not a smart guy.And we’re going to have to take out ISIS and we’re going to have to take them out fast.Well, we’re going to be spending money.They’re killing Caterpillar.So this week itâ€™s Robert E. Lee.There are hundreds of things like that.So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you’re not a nice person.(Applause.)It's a scandal.I can’t bring it back into this country.Okay?But forget that.In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America â€” and this is an incredible statistic â€” would totally wipe out the gains from Americaâ€™s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.She has done a terrible job as secretary of State.We were doing it together.Because they want to be part – they want to –
…Let me tell you, who is more than me?And I want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us.These are great people.He doesn’t have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things.These are our finest.There are so many things to do.Woman:
Thank you.So again folks this has been an amazing evening.We’re going to absolutely do the right thing.Because of the new business climate that weâ€™re creating, jobs are already starting to pour back in â€” companies like Sprint, Intel, Exxon-Mobile â€” where a great man, Rex Tillerson, is doing an incredible job â€” (applause) â€” ran that company for many years and ran it well.It was going to be the three of them.We’re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of Hillary.So what happened essentially is I started looking and all of a sudden things changed.And I’ll end up doing fine with the establishment...


...I’m such a believer in education.Go home and ideally give the money back.It’s Iowa – we love Iowa.BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY I WROTE THIS QUICKLY, BUT IT MEANS IT CAME RIGHT FROM THE HEART.We have so much potential.They donâ€™t want to be in Iran.And I don’t necessarily want to stop people from giving because I think that’s a good thing but you have to get away from these PACs.You donâ€™t remember that.Okay.Because I don’t care...Now, of course, they don’t know the extent.They didnâ€™t know the year.The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide.But they’ve treated me – some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right?Let’s face it.It would have been great.They’re great people.But everybody that’s hit me so far has gone down.Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States.I was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job.And I will tell you that is my â€” I would be so happy if we never had to use it.No, it’s a compliment.I gave millions to these guys.Q    Well, Iâ€™ll ask you one final question â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  You â€” donâ€™t make me wrong.You have said twice today â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, weâ€™re looking at it very, very seriously.They make a fortune.And by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific.He’s sitting there and he goes – and he got angry – he goes "Why wouldn’t he make it?Get out there and vote!You look at Mexico.He’s got nurses but he’s got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy.I mean, that’s not a big deal.Not going to happen anymore.First of all, they’re going to get nuclear.I’ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president.And that’s why — and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and I’m so proud of it, CNN just came out with a poll a couple of, I guess a week ago — 36 percent for Trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12.THE ONLY TIME THAT KERRY LEFT WAS AT 73 YEARS OLD TO GO INTO A BICYCLE LACE WHERE HE FELL AND BROKE HIS LEG, RIGHT.And we must support the victims of crime.This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.And they walked in just said "Boom!It is a disaster.TRUMP: And remember the $5 billion Web site?And you know why?The number probably is going to be – when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million.He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him.4,000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening.I’ve gotta do it."And I talk about our success because that’s ultimately what it’s all about.WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Twenty-eight.But I’ll tell you who doesn’t like Hillary are women.As the cameras start going off in the background.AIDE:  Yes, we do.And you know what?Tough stuff.People are scared.And you add them up – and I’m over here with a lot.Thank you.Again, I say it â€” there has never been a presidency thatâ€™s done so much in such a short period of time.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I love it.Now I know some people say I’m too much of a fighter.That's a great thing.I’ve been saying it.A great friend of mine, Senator Bob Corker.They’re being treated terribly.Because the bad guys all moved back.THE PRESIDENT:  Right.We’re going to bring our jobs back.I see there could be a number.You know, the one good thing about executive orders?It's been not easy for them.Then because of Paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil.We’re going to make our own products.And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is.So everyone knows that walls work.I mean, we know that for a fact.We’re going to have a real border.And thatâ€™s why we had â€” over the last five or six years, if you average it out, we had $800 billion a year in trade losses.Go home.And immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor.I have such respect for these people.So easy.100%.The deductibles on Obamacare it’s through the roof.Sometimes something that should be very positive, theyâ€™ll make okay.They werenâ€™t even asking for a change.Itâ€™s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, theyâ€™re not putting you in; theyâ€™re putting some very bad people in the lottery.I would say 25, 30 people would tell me ... every time I’d shake people’s hand, "Oh, you have nice hands."I negotiate with banks.If need be, that’s what’s going to have to happen.And then when they come back, we take them back.Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.We wrote a book and the title – "Crippled America" – is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we’ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is.They’re not allowed to do their job.Iâ€™m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for our workers and our companies, to attract new companies and businesses to our shores, and to put more money into the pockets of everyday, hardworking people and also into the pockets of our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.If they get attacked, we have World War III, we have to protect them.How are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door.We’re going to take care of it, and it’s going to be done in a very humane way.You know, I got 52 percent with women.Because when businesses compete for labor, your wages will go up.And I just — I want to just shoot the television, you know?So it’s very special to me.Heâ€™s a gem.Wait, wait â€” watch how friendly he is.Ramos.So South Korea — I order televisions, I order thousands of televisions a year.Itâ€™s going to be very big.(Applause.)Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least â€” I think the number is ridiculously low â€” by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.So I want to thank the volunteers.Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed.One of the things I think that’s so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy – so important – Trump 55%.And now, we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world, which is Iraq.I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught.I donâ€™t care.And Mike worked hard on that.Think of that.You know, it’s so simple when you think about it.Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history.But I’m not seeing polls that are great.And that’s one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack.I have a friend, who’s a farmer, and if a puddle forms, they consider it a lake for the purposes of environmental.(Applause.)Legitimately, they could not get an environmental impact statement.(Applause.)I’d like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us.We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.But do you know if I answer that question, we’d have a big, big story.You’ll probably say, "We can’t give – the caucus, just forget it.Q However, what we are concerned about, and what we havenâ€™t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.It is fitting that we are in the National Building Museum.He said, "Let me just ask you about NATO."I’ve got the greatest guys in the world.No, heâ€™s OK. Heâ€™s OK.

By the way, is there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?I think we’ll win virtually every state in the Union and it’s over quickly.It feels good...And South Korea, I think you can say, has been â€” weâ€™ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan.And now that they’ve become radicalized, they’re totally radicalized.about the president’s speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I don’t care.I was told "Don’t even go to Iowa.I wanted to ask about China.Yes.So Iâ€™m going to be signing a national emergency.But I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know it’s rough stuff, it’s rough stuff.Folks, those days are over.That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.They had no idea.And when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, it’s going to be put to work in our country, largely.You see that with Kate in San Francisco.They're going to stay there.PBS, Public Broadcasting System — 69 percent said Trump won.Thank you.We will get it solved.You know, with my businesses, I’ve always been very respected.He’s been a great divider for the country.Wouldn’t it be?Right?You want to control your own politician.And we will never forget Ryan.You know Iraq was horrible.Iâ€™m like a messenger.Somebody else would come, they’d have like 50 people and they wouldn’t need this room.Weâ€™re going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before.Whether itâ€™s El Paso â€” I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso â€” we had a tremendous crowd, and â€” tremendous crowd.I see it now even more than I saw it in this great campaign â€” which turned out to be a movement, a movement like the world has never seen before, actually.He is a solid, solid person.And one of the questions was about Israel and the Palestinians what’s going to happen.I will not say it.I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning.Where is that good"?And Steve Burke, who’s a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said "Come on, Donald.I’ll go after some of the numbers.Every single online poll has me winning the debates.Israel feels so left alone and I know BiBi and a lot of my friends are from Israel and they feel so left out.That’s like, you know, very once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal.Maybe and maybe not.You saw that.When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy.They spend money.The one thing I have to say and I have to ask you to do, go out and vote.And you donâ€™t get much worse â€” bad reputation, too.Ships – the biggest ships you’ve ever seen.Now, I wouldn’t have done this but he endorsed Cruz.They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars.I think weâ€™re going to go down the two-state road.â€  And Iâ€™m glad I got it out.I just came from a tour of Andrew Jacksonâ€™s home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.All of the political geniuses.We have evidence.So we get Bergdahl, and that’s what we get.Itâ€™s great to be in my second home â€” Florida.Theyâ€™re concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed, violently, on the streets, which is happening all over our country.THE PRESIDENT: Fix the inner cities, yes.You can look it up.And they say in terms of enthusiasm they have never had polling higher.He knew about it.He’s not a natural born citizen.In fact, I hear nine years.We’re going to knock out the ISIS.(Applause.)He can’t get his goods into China.If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, Iâ€™m not going to put in my stars; Iâ€™m going to put in people I donâ€™t want.And everything heâ€™s done has been a home run.I go to China.And it will be so powerful that I don’t think we’re going to ever have to use it.(Applause.)Very nice guy....They’re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run.He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.You watch.Iâ€™ll answer that one.â€  He goes for three hours, and heâ€™s got an audience thatâ€™s fantastic.I said, "America."Thank you.Heâ€™s been on â€” I guess youâ€™d call it the second highest court.She said, "No, the only way you’re going to get a poll number is you’ve got to announce."Let’s just say bad names.Because that’s really terrible.I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit – you know, took a long time.And by the way, that’s going to be a lot less expensive.They’re not coming into this country.But that’s such a tiny percentage.They’re killing us.She was not expected to live past five.THE PRESIDENT:  Itâ€™s not a benefit of the doubt.And those women â€” theyâ€™re incredible women â€” they went on television â€” and they didnâ€™t want to, and I didnâ€™t ask them.So we have a lot of problems.The other day I got this great review.Thirteen of them.(Laughter.)Most of these people aren’t paying anyway."THE PRESIDENT:  I will tell you something.You’ve got to make deals.Q Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?Under a Trump Presidency, the American worker will finally have a President who will protect them and fight for them.I talked silent majority.Our defense expansion will fully pay â€” and this will be something that is so important â€” it will be fully paid by making government leaner, more accountable and just perfect for our people.What can I say?Theyâ€™ll charge us 100 percent tax on some â€” 100 percent.And I saw it because I was on the border.Heâ€™s taking over the government.Weâ€™d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.And you know it started really – we’ve had really a pretty good week.We need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money.Thereâ€™s been nothing like it.I make good deals.I want to win Iowa, folks.And there’s so many more.You could have both Sharons stand up actually.You know, honestly, he should go home and relax.Naturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should.We’re going to do the right thing.If I win, believe me, it’s not going to happen.Send them up."Big league.I think weâ€™re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.I will say that.Okay, how about just a couple more.If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.You know why?So I want to thank everybody for being here.I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down.THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT HATE OUR COUNTRY.But I backed McCain; he lost.Because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way.I don’t work for any of these people that are leading our country in the wrong direction.Yes, go ahead.But it is interesting.This is the moment when great deeds are done â€” and we will do those great deeds.And I have some very smart friends don’t agree with me; they agree with the other side.People have been paying it for years.THE PRESIDENT: Are they friends of yours?The whole case should have been dropped.I mean, con job â€” it is.Nobody knows that, but â€” (laughter) â€” I donâ€™t want to destroy her reputation.I love you…Thank you.I’ve been saying not really bomb – I’ve been saying take the oil.If somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like Brad who raises hundreds of millions.Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future â€” one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world.It’s a great company.And it's disgraceful.They’re just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera.But much of it is not â€” the distortion.I was watching all the networks.Do you mind if I said it?"It’s very successful.A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built.But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow.Hard to believe.Right?What the hell is Monmouth?We are running â€” this is a fine-tuned machine.You know, when I’ve got a big audience.But I didn’t – it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me.And they said, "What would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than Donald Trump?"People send in money.We will have strong borders.I want to help the migration.(Applause.)And you know what I want to do?And, by the way, a lot of African-American employees, a lot of Hispanic employees.He’s always sitting with John McCain, who’s fine.Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we’re a nation that speaks English and I think that while we’re in this nation, we should be speaking English.I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight youâ€™re having.And I said — and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do.It is going to be amazingly destructive.And these are all false â€” to me, these are false accusations in certain cases.Enjoy yourselves.But I believe we will have a very good relationship with Russia.Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months.I'll be going to Nevada.After years of disappointment, there’s one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the rigged system by relying on very – and I mean this so, so strongly – on the very people who rigged it.You know, it’s interesting.You really helped me a lot.Following my executive action â€” and donâ€™t forget, weâ€™ve only been here for like â€” what?Q    Thank you, Mr. President.AMAZING.We’re going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics.And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries.I don’t need anybody’s money.We’re going to build the wall.And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.Guys walk in with guns and you have no gun.You know we have four.We have our soul in it.And they’re people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place.We lived in a divided nation.SHE IS THE ONE THAT CREATED IT.And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine.I’m a great president."THE MONEY THEY'VE TAKEN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, I MEAN THEY HAVE TRAINS THAT CAN HE CAN ONLY DREAM ABOUT.We’ll get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change.50 soldiers – that’s not a lot even though they’re the elite.And everybody’s talking about it.LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON.What will we do with this moment?He just said they’re going to build a wall.Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid.I should.I said, "The people of Iowa can’t be that stupid or the people of the country can’t – ".Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy.So with trade, we’re going to solve the trade problem.China is not even doing that well.Anybody I forgot?AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, PROBLEMS WILL HAPPEN.I haven’t done anything ‘cause frankly if I don’t win I consider this to be a total waste of time."He knew about it.That I can tell you.It’s not.We got nothing.How does this kind of immigration make our country better?Those days are over.They’d fight, fight, fight.These are a lot of my friends, but you have been so helpful.You saw it at the World Trade Center.Mexico will pay for the wall by the way.But I’ve raised almost $6 million.You know, she's talking — I see the ads she puts on.(Applause.)PERFECT.In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent.We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.It’s a total mess.That doesnâ€™t work.The unfairness.Different competitions whether it’s sports or business or now for 10 months politics.And then the New York Times did an editorial "How dare you attack the Asians?"I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY BACK, I REALLY DO.I mean, okay?We had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country.$5 billion Web site.We’re going to win.And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN – that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity.THE PRESIDENT:  I didnâ€™t know David Duke was there.The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991.Itâ€™s destroyed.They don’t want to lose their jobs.$350,000.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.She had the reset.And we won.But every day they announce more and more.But let me give you the bad, the sad news.Q    Well, can you please explain then what youâ€™re talking about in your own false allegations?I have thousands of people going.You come into La Guardia Airport, it’s like we’re in a third world country.I took a deep breath and I said, "Let’s go" to my wife and we came down that escalator.Her disastrous record speaks for itself.There was not even – nobody even there!I’m very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things.But we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it’s crooked stuff.I want to spend wisely.We have a good relationship.That I can tell you.(Applause.)They told me that.And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations â€” people that arenâ€™t big into clapping, applauding, smiling.Please stand up.Q    Iâ€™m actually from the New York Times.BUT HE'S AN AMAZING GUY.They didn’t mention that.Except that it doesn’t help us.And Mexico is not helping us.But you have to be there.Every single corner.And I donâ€™t want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me?Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.And it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look.She can’t do that.Ports of entry.And you know why?You ever hear of a place called Iowa?I said, from now on we have to go â€” we have to build them here.But you have heard this about Obamacare.THE PRESIDENT: Russia is a ruse.â€” 50 days â€” weâ€™ve already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day â€” 61 percent.It was a fluke.I said, "Honestly, Steve, I’m running for President.And you see just the other day, the car companies coming in with Foxconn.Second, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization.What do you mean you have no drug problem?â€  â€œNo, we donâ€™t have a drug problem.â€  I said, â€œWhy?â€ â€œDeath penalty.Everybody said "Number one, he won’t run."YOU LOOK AT JAPAN, THE BIGGEST SHIPS YOU'VE EVER SEEN FLOATING IN, AND I WAS IN LOS ANGELES, THEY FLOAT IN THESE MASSIVE, MASSIVE SHIPS LOADED UP WITH CARS.I think their leaders are doing a great job for them.WE'RE WINNING TOO MUCH.I never saw them do anything wrong.Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls, and gates, and guards.Thank you.No, that happens with endorsement.This is our mission.That’s just shows you.Iâ€™ve cleared the way for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines â€” and added a requirement that American pipelines be constructed with American steel.There’s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn’t make a better deal.They came up with a poll.So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.He said "Donald Trump is" – I think he used the word – "terrific".We’re going to be spending money – we’re going to be spending a lot of money.American workers will be hired to do the job.I’ve said NATO need to change its focus and stop terrorism.I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him.It’s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.Not much.Nothing.Iâ€™m telling you, you look at North Korea.We can’t let that happen.But then, under this pro-America system, our economy boomed.Itâ€™s my highest poll number.We have to start winning again.Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people.You know, they’re tough.Theyâ€™ve taken advantage â€” I love Canada, by the way.And you’re talking about one company I know of – I don’t know how much they’ve written about it – but you’re talking about 6,000 jobs just one company.We will always honor their memory.I mean, this is me.But look at Marco’s stance on illegal immigration.You turn out, weâ€™re winning big league.And we’re going to make it rich again, and we’re going to make it strong again.I had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that I was watching.That’s what they’re doing, folks.Yes, maâ€™am.And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before.We give them practically nothing.Remember that.I just don’t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies.But let me just tell you something â€” that I hate the charge.They are taking us, frankly, to the cleaners.You know, as far as that’s concerned.In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones.And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine.He did a good job, but I couldnâ€™t stand him.I’m totally accountable but I didn’t want to have credit for it.HE USED IT ON LIVE TELEVISION.Itâ€™s a lot cheaper.You know, we are protecting them.I’ll say it’s time for change but real change this time not that change.It’s almost like, I don’t even know.We should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating.(Applause.)So, Paris, why donâ€™t we start with you?Because she was deposed, she was such a bad witness that we’d win the case easily.And you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else.I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IF THEY SAID IT IS NOT IMPORTANT.We had a court thatâ€™s been overturned â€” again, maybe wrong, but I think itâ€™s 80 percent of the time.That’s true.And believe me, you know, Cruz likes to pretend he’s an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor.I’ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work.And we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing.It’s an instinct.They can’t make a deal.He didnâ€™t have to do that, because what he did wasnâ€™t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw.And they want a lot.I thought Scott was terrific.They have no power.Because what she did was just wrong.One is, how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the Chinese to what Russia did in 2016?And the last two weeks because I've gotten to see so many -- I guess millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches.I mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say "What’s going on?We have — I have so many — we have so much potential.It’s got to be America first.I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world â€” the President who is a very fine man, by the way.So just remember that.Thank you.My goal is always again to bring people together.Largest bank in the world my tenant.Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times.Nothing.THE PRESIDENT:  No, Iâ€™m talking about the Times is failing.Can we have more?"(Applause.)And one other thing I said â€” and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople â€” I think Iâ€™ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, itâ€™s just not going to work.So, that turned out – I was 100% right.We had – " I was joking.(Laughter)


And that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10.With a hammer!Why aren’t you on David Letterman?...No, I don’t think so.I vote for you."We will have all troops out.And thatâ€™s part of the problem of this country.We’re going to take.Youâ€™re going to do a fantastic job.But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that weâ€™re asking for.They know it.THEY REPRESENT OUR HIGHEST IDEALS, OUR GREATEST VALUES, AND OUR MOST NOBLE CHARACTERISTICS.If the media doesn’t believe me, I have a challenge for you.I don’t think they had a choice.And negotiate trade deals that put America first.I get along with everybody.We owe $19 trillion.THE PRESIDENT: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.The wall just got 10 feet taller."Itâ€™s going to be amazing.It’s all about that.Weâ€™re going to need better schools, and we need them soon.Q    Mr. President, my name is Edward Szall, with TruNews.Well, it’s a company in South Carolina but they don’t make them there; they assemble them.Everybody talk so much – "Oh, the surge was so great."WE CAN'T TAKE IT.25,000 people.IRS, e-mails.No, I want to take that thinking to the White House.We’re going to start making Apple computers in this country.And that’s right, there will be a wall built.I (inaudible).But I’ve seen it.Why can’t we be unpredictable?Q So if I may ask you that â€” if I may ask a follow-up â€”

THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but are you â€” let me do one at a time.We’re being run by people that don’t know what they’re doing.I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do.I love polls.The Republican platform of 1896 â€” more than a century ago â€” stated that: â€œProtection and reciprocity are twin measures of American policy and go hand in hand.â€ I mean, we have situations where other countries who have zero respect for our country â€” by the way, do you notice theyâ€™re starting to respect us a lot?To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations.WE LOSE FIVE AND MAYBE SIX, BUT FIVE AT LEAST PEOPLE LOOKING FOR HIM.What do you think, Peter?I think heâ€™s a friend of mine.You can’t spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $2,000.Who did really well?And so many others.Youâ€™ve been great.It kills tens of thousands of people â€” I think far more than anybody registers.(Laughter.)That’s correct.This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.Wouldn’t it be wonderful if, let’s see, this guy right here in front of me, he’s a tough guy.JUST REMEMBER THAT.Now it’s even better but we didn’t have that certified yet.And I’m not going to let the car companies and Nabisco and all these people and all these companies – I’m all for free trade.I donâ€™t want to have a chemistry with them.The people that give her all of this money believe in it.I said no nicely.Take a look.Amazing.(Applause.)He wants to do it.But weâ€™re going to work on education.(Applause.)And we will stand with oppressed people.You know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married.Look what that says.THE PRESIDENT:  If I thought he was â€” if I thought he was guilty of something like this, yeah sure.But we can turn this all around.Why does he have to say that for?I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND BORE EVERYBODY.That’s a lot.But I go home, and I watch, and the pundits will say — and they can’t totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know what’s happening — well, Mr. Trump was OK tonight.But we’re number one in spending per pupil by far.(Applause.)And so I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family.It’s against the law.I said no, no, I don’t want.But for the most part, I have very good â€” very good with Prime Minister Abe.You want to see it go up?But we’re leading New Hampshire big.I love excavators.The George Washington Bridge.We won’t have these characters.Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.(Applause.)They are yearning for help.It’s going to lead to nuclear proliferation – the 24-day clause – everything about it.He’s a nice guy."(Applause.)I don’t give a damn.But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that’s their money because there’s no way of bringing it in.It’s crazy.Every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases.I’m here for a certain reason.Iâ€™m the one that settled it.The drugs are a great question.Weâ€™re dealing with them, weâ€™re talking to them.(Applause.)Everybody thought it was a done deal.They agreed with me.Called it "astounding."No, honestly he’s a great guy.And you will be surprised how big you are.[ CHEERING ] WHOA!We owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion.Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.If you don’t have talented people, if you don’t have great leadership, if you don’t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.I have many Mexican people and Hispanics working for me.Do you agree?They don’t want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax.I think her email situation is very serious.They pulled back.For three years they can’t get a deal.Are we babies?And Kasich was way down.How's business?But we’re not getting – we’re not getting – anything much for it.Yes, go ahead.People should get out.You know, let’s go to a new subject, okay?"I won in landslides.It’s really hurt him.They call us the dumb Americans.Everyone said, â€œThis couldnâ€™t happen â€” 52 percent.â€  Women are so angry.They are warriors, and they have old equipment.Remember?(Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Donâ€™t even think about it.I love this.We have to form a partnership, with our Muslim communities.I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.And we’re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, they’re young and they’re strong.Weâ€™re going to make great deals out of horrible deals.And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country.And here’s what the...I was telling the people and they said "Wow, that sounds good."We’re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that.Hereâ€™s a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.We’ve got to take – you’ve got to take care of us.Big in New Hampshire.Because I think Jeb probably endorsed – huh?The Democrats and the Republicans.Come for love?I mean, I’ve seen such beautiful letters.I appreciate it.I mean, they have no concept of business.You know, you can do without certain industries.We have a military that needs help and especially in these times.And she saw it and she was here early.In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and, when you get down to it, thereâ€™s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America.Not one single dollar can we waste.Q Iâ€™m very professional.MARCHES ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, AND TOUGH MARCHES, ANGER, HATRED, HATRED.I said, "You don’t understand.I think they should disarm immediately.It seems that there is a disconnect there.Theyâ€™re supposed to be â€” and he didnâ€™t just call Russia.Think if you had some guns in Paris on the good side, right?You know, I hear a lot of people say, â€œOh, well.Thank you, all, very much.I would say actually, greater by far than anybody else.Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war.The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States.(Applause.)SPEECH 8


This is so — so incredible.Right?And we’re like a dumping ground for the world.THANK YOU.They’re fed up with the media.Theyâ€™re having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama.And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan.He’s a great guy.The veterans â€” we love our veterans.(Applause.)Then they said "Well, maybe he won’t do so well with the polls."I’m turning down millions.I get along great.But this is something – and I’ve been watching it for a long time – everybody agrees to.That’s why we’re here all the time.But when I raise $5.6 million as of today, more is coming in.Go ahead.Thank you.Great honor, thank you.Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.Weâ€™ve never had that before with China.Believe me.All you have to do is go and see Israel.And they are incredible people.Q    They do.They’re not going to be able to.China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.So I don’t know what they’re going to do.And then he said, "Oh, I misspoke."If I changed my views, he wouldnâ€™t be with me.The $100.Yes, go ahead.And you all know what I’m talking about.And he was a powerful president.If we can win in South Carolina, we’re going to go – I mean, we could very well run the table.I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud.How does this kind of immigration make our lives better?You donâ€™t see it anymore.We’re taking away deductions and that’s one of the reasons we’re able to lower it.But I will say this.Just relax.So you know, they had 24 million people on the debate.One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who â€” weâ€™re talking about killed, in the year of â€™18.But right now, they have a big target on their back.Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities.Thank you.I just don’t know what’s going to happen because I don’t know whether or not the Democrats are going to protect her.The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has.I said to him, General â€” General Mattis â€” I said, General, I need somebody really smart and really tough for the border.When you’re not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don’t want you at all.WE'RE GOING TO BEAT ISIS.WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS.He doesn’t want money.And don’t forget, that’s with three people.Many of them do talk to the press.My preference is always peace, however.So anyways, so I think we’re going to do great in New York.Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again, remember.Weâ€™re also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism.Well, I think radical Islam right now is, and I feel that’s the greatest.But, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone – the tone – of Donald Trump is not nice.We pay for everybody else’s military.If you go back, you could see 2003, 2004, I said it’s going to totally destabilize the Middle East because you had Iran and Iraq and they were the same militarily.And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I donâ€™t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people.And if it does, you can let me know about it.Is that right?Look, I want to see an honest press.Because we’re down the line and the fact that you can’t win as independent.And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively.And I’ll tell you what, I love Florida."Oh, come on back.So very, very big on the Second Amendment.So the executive order that President Obama signed, the one good thing about an executive order, in the first minute in office, I will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders.WE'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THAT THEY DO A GREAT JOB.I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.We like Mr. Trump.â€ They called up my office â€” we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.He comes to New York.The reason companies aren’t bringing it back is the tax is onerous.Thank you very much.And to get it done, I want Iowa.He is really a special person.I’ve employed — I’ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.I don’t care about the room.I donâ€™t say Iâ€™m going into Mosul in four months.We spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world.We have trillions and trillions of dollars offshore.And I said, "I know.We’re going to turn this country around.China is coming here next week, by the way.High taxes and regulations.Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we’ve done.Most of the papers donâ€™t print it because thatâ€™s not good for their stories.…I like Telemundo by the way.In other words, it’s a little close here.Thank you.Q    So you donâ€™t think anyone in your administration has ever discussed using the 25th Amendment against you?Thank you.And it’s as he or she deems appropriate.So when I got back tonight and I started watching all of the different networks, I could immediately that we were doing very well, and it really looks like a massive victory and it looks like we win all 57 delegates.As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens.Representative Sam Graves.They’re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately.And frankly, I would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the drain.A Trump Administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people.In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.I get a long with everybody.We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes – many of them actually – and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income.I won with news conferences and probably speeches.And you're going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because Obamacare -- if you look -- look at the increases in your Obamacare.I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.And I think weâ€™re going to make a deal.And you say that.Boom!I will say that.We owe $19 trillion in debt.I mean, some votes were stolen from Ben Carson, which by the way was a disgrace.But listen to this.Thank you, Jerry.We have a lot of press here today.I think they’re losing a fortune.I’ll put in some friendly protesters.And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in.They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us.I love the people.This has been a great period of time.Amazingly, there’s a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC.And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars.All right?They make so much money.They have a wonderful company that they’re working for, and now all of a sudden they’re cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare.And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.We don’t know where their documents are.This poor Chuck Todd, Meet the Press.I’m going to win.Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.Take a look at Israel.And I heard a little rustle.It was so beautiful.We pay rent.Right?You can say, oh, Obamacare â€” I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but theyâ€™re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.I was here three weeks ago with the group...They were such amazing people...And I learned so much about it.(Applause.)They’re 40 years old.No problem.Your husband was just killed in Maryland.They don’t talk about it.You look at no jobs.Itâ€™s very helpful.And so finally I said, "Look, let’s – we’re going to do it.Thank you very much.We'll do the wall.The surge was great because everybody knew – they knew what was happening.I’ll tell you something.You just can’t do it.We all got lucky.We’re going to win.And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history – in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor.I think itâ€™s actually 32.(Applause.)So let’s let him think he has this great victory with the surge."I saw ships – the biggest ships I’ve ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice.So itâ€™s a very sad situation.THE PRESIDENT:  I want to watch.Yes?I mean, things will straighten out and it’s going to be our benefit.100.The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy.Not quite, right?I believe it.They are all talk and no action.You know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1.5 – think of this – trillion.And the people are standing there.And you know, I can understand the other side.So Sarah, I mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but I am a truth-teller and I will tell the truth, OK?Q    The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together.I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people.And I think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again.Iâ€™m ready to do my part, and I will say this:  Weâ€™re going to work together.We can’t put up with it.But they’re great shots so it’s one of those things.You think they don’t know?But the press loves saying â€œAnn Coulter.â€  Probably, if I did speak to her, sheâ€™d be very nice.But essentially, we had 112- 12.And Iâ€™ve been lecturing them, including the gentleman that youâ€™re referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country.It’s all of us.Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.Some of them are Democrats, I must say.In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the â€œGreat Crusadeâ€ â€” the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.Thank you.And it’s been some unbelievable day and evening and year.Got them jobs.We have great border patrol people.We’re going to win on trade.And they came out some brand new ones – some beauties.That I can tell you.And that’s how assimilation takes.If they want two states, thatâ€™s okay with me.I think debating is a good thing.Thank you, Elvin.They end up killing themselves before they see the doctor.On these issues and so many more, weâ€™re following through on our commitments.Q    â€” how did those impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?You can’t let people push you around.You look at some of these places, it’s like a disaster.Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat.And you know, I want to keep it that way.And it surely is not a friend to Israel.It’s a scam.He’ll sell you a car any day of the week, right?If you’re single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you’ll not pay any income tax – nothing.$1.5 trillion.I mean, Hillary.We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama.And I could pick, as an example â€” hopefully I wonâ€™t have to do it as a replacement because hopefully this is going to go very well on Thursday.Or whatever.I think he had like 5 or 6 and I had 20 or 22.These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.Other countries saw the success.Q    Are you worried â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™ll tell you one thing I can say: Iâ€™ve had a lot of people talking about this to me, with respect to whatâ€™s happening, because itâ€™s a horrible precedent.And â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Iâ€™m learning.They get it, you know?And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong.Boom!I have thousands of employees.We have to stop it, folks.She didnâ€™t do anything.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, being a businessman has been a great experience for me.And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he’ll change his mind and stay.And then you wonder why Iâ€™m winning in Michigan.Their manufacturing is gone.Last night in front of the audience I said we’re going to have so many victories.It’s going to be an amazing two months.CBS, 59 percent.They were smarter than our leaders.In fact, the primary fight was on the wall.I understand the political system and I understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants.John, go ahead.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.I mean, you call it a tie.I was in for like $2 million.My book is very hard-hitting.They’re not supposed to be talking.And one of the people on the little group said Donald Trump is a great businessman but he’ll never make it as a President.On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it.Iâ€™ve said that a lot and I mean it.I see it all the time.So here’s what we’re going to do.We will win.And that’s what I do.Q And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.This is not an act of offense against anyone.People change their minds.Also on my first day Iâ€™m going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.One of the other things that I’m coupling this with is if I become President, I’m going to renegotiate our trade deals.I build.Meganâ€™s story is about the unbounded power of a fatherâ€™s love for a daughter.Itâ€™s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.It’s got to be beautiful because someday they’re going to name it the Trump Wall.We can’t have it.USA!I’ll be so good.It’s too long.That's like the real estate location, location.You know that.We’re going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but I think we’re going to have a great victory.Our politicians in most cases don’t even know what’s happening.No, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are.Last month, we celebrated the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history.For as the Bible teaches us, â€œThere is no greater act of love than to lay down oneâ€™s life for oneâ€™s friends.â€  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom.She says she is.More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.So weâ€™re just getting started.I think it’s great that she’s [Carly Fiorina] in the debate.What a great – the Persians are great negotiators."I love — we love setting records.And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that.It’s true.And nobody in this room believes it.And I love Mexico.…Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll?We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets.Like, you know, look at me.Why can’t he do that?Take a look at what's happening with the V.A.You know, it's very interesting.And I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman [James] Ada who was a fantastic man and that was a very nice start to the day.Weâ€™ve got to stop it.I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous — really prosperous society for all Americans.Tremendous.And this is true all over.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.AND I WOULD HAVE SAID VERY NICELY, MY FATHER USED TO THINK I WAS A LITTLE BIT ROUGH, AND HE USED TO GO, EASY, SON.So we have to do something about it.The numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire – the PPP poll – Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board.But as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration.All of this was motivated by personal political calculation.Maybe I shouldn’t mention that particular bridge.They don’t have any energy.Indiana's unemployment rate — and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family — Karen is amazing.Q    Mr. President â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Theyâ€™re great people.The time for action is now.At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them.We have some of the greatest people I know.But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.I don’t think that Wisconsin should have a big problem with discipline.Russia is fake news.I’ve done it time after time."It’s interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great.No, it’s too long.But the DACA situation is a very, very â€” itâ€™s a very difficult thing for me.I said take the oil.It’s over.(Applause.)They have so power over us.I don’t know.I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.We will build a wall.He’s proud to do it.A new chapter â€” (applause) â€” of American Greatness is now beginning.I really do.And I said, â€œThatâ€™s not going to happen.â€  I didnâ€™t hear of Idlib Province.Hey, we’ve got plenty of time to sit down, right?So I’ve watched the politicians.They showed up in Charlottesville to protest â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me.I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I canâ€™t move, it might be bad for me politically, I canâ€™t have that meeting.Thank you.YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO ROUGH.Some of you are fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party and knowingly saying incorrect things.You might know...We protect Japan.But when I give that answer, some people say "Oh, Trump doesn’t know.And they talk all the time about racist, racist.Thank you.I wanted to stay in Florida campaign.In fact, when I ran this, they said why didn’t you settle up that case?THE GREATEST SINGLE THING IN MY OPINION THAT SHE'S EVER DONE IS TO GET OUT OF THE E-MAIL PROBLEM.And we’ll talk about the polls in a second.A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY I'M AN ISOLATIONIST, WHEN YOU LOSE $800 BILLION A YEAR ON TRADE DEFICITS, MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE WORSE THING.I appreciate it.And we’ve got to be smart.We have every record.It is the cheapest, single investment we can make.Wait a minute.If Cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn’t get – because it’s all establishment.We love it.You look at schools.Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.I want President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.â€

The second claim, so-called â€œObstruction of Congress,â€ is preposterous and dangerous.Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades â€” decades and decades and decades, folks.I hope you all stay and it’s going to be wonderful…


…So I was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters from AP and they did a very good job.It's South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them.It’s hard to believe.Not only their children, by the way, they’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is and we don’t know what’s happening.Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied all the way up to the present day, even going so far as to fraudulently make up, out of thin air, my conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy language to Congress as though it were said by me.Ah, they treat me very nicely in Scotland.I loved it.(Applause.)Think of it.We want to run the table.Very bad.Now, they’re controlled by their PACs.And you know, these are amazing states and we’re going to probably get a lot more.So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day.Ford is moving there with a big plant.They really get it.I feel like – am I a fool?Now he’s at zero.I win; they’re not touching Iowa.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.Because as you know, if I would have said China, I would have been in big, big trouble.I have spent and invested so much money over here.Okay?And that’s what we have= representing us.They gave it away.THEY WON'T TAKE THEM.Oh.We’re going to get — but they’re not accepting people.I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings.SPEECH 1


...Thank you so much.We’ll be spending money on ads and we’ll be spending money on the ground game.I was pretty sure.The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.I made so much money dealing with China.And frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it.Beada remembers that.I said "Don’t go into Iraq" and they shouldn’t have because I said you’re going to destabilize the Middle East.I like you.Quick, letâ€™s go.I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney.I didn’t want the credit for raising all this money for the vets.But I want every American to succeed including Muslims.Theyâ€™re giving stuff â€” what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates â€” which, by the way, nobody mentions.So it’s not only costing you a lot of money, it’s going to cost the country a fortune.She said, "Do you mind?You know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now.Same venue, same everything.And I want to trade all over the world.They want that — they want education.Many of them are reluctant to come forward.Like they have never seen.You know, it’s funny.They moved them all the way south – all the way south – and they didn’t come back.I want money, money.THE PRESIDENT:  I did it the last time.Okay, let’s do a couple of questions.They don’t know it’s unpredictability.But we called, called, called, called â€” they canâ€™t make a meeting with him.I have working for me thousands right now – thousands of Hispanics.Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they’re beating us in trade.We are now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.Everyone is listening to you now.Oh, I love this.WE'RE GOING TO KICK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS.Look at that chart.Very unfair penalty.Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.Weâ€™re going to have the cleanest air.But it’s an expense.You know, so many – we’ve had such incredible support.And we were talking border security, which we’re just doing so great with the border security.They have a major chance to speak.Wouldn’t horrible but you know it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.This is a very dark moment in America’s history.I’m not a celebrity.Iâ€™m always prepared.We have a country, or we don’t.You want to love everybody.Q    How would â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  And it all started with the WTO.Why don’t we take some questions from the press?It’s just gross incompetence at the highest level.I’m the most conservative.We lost everything.They self-inspect.They’re doing it for themselves.We’re not going to have jobs left.You’ll be amazed.I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldn’t say I exactly love doing after the first one.And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.Weâ€™ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.We have to do what’s right for our country.We have all the cards, but we don’t know how to use them.What is the status there?Whoa.Ayeyeye, we are in a big fat ugly bubble.This is evil.This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business.(Applause.)But I will tell you what surprises me tremendously is that the people that have these cuts, theyâ€™re more concerned with regulation than even a big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and stopping our businesses from hiring people, jobs.You know, I’ve devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven’t done what I’ve done.I want to go in there.I buy a company.Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved.Was right.Just fact.These are people that â€” they donâ€™t have to be here.You know, we have some good, some bad…
But I said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other.And then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%.And frankly, I think that’s fine.The hell – they can have him even if we don’t get the five guys back because that’s not going to happen because you know where they are right now?But you’ve got to attack.It’s never going to work.$4 trillion.It means on foreign policy, we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation.Or they’re going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it.On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and businesses.I’ve been here before."The mastermind is on the loose."And you’ll be losing a lot over the next little while.What he builds is plants.We don’t win anymore.The problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don’t know what they’re doing.They think he’s going to get away with nothing.Not right.Youâ€™ll have your chance.Here we have generals.We have â€” weâ€™ll soon have a military like weâ€™ve never had before.What Cruz – what this guy Cruz did with Ben Carson was an absolute disgrace.What she did is criminal with the emails.We never have to use it.Go ahead.We have people that don’t know the first thing about the word negotiation.America First.As you saw today in the Senate, I nominated a Supreme Court justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.IF WE DON'T, IF WE DON'T, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY ANYMORE.Iâ€™m in favor of safety and security, and low taxes.We have people that are morally corrupt.So I want to tell you this story.I’m suing Univision for $500 million.I look at him and I watch him and I watch his motions and I watch what he says.We sell them beef.This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.We’re soon going to be at $20 trillion.TRUMP: According to the economists — who I’m not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they’re saying — that $24 trillion — we’re very close — that’s the point of no return.If somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be Republican, I may choose to hit them back.Let me tell you something, folks.And we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening.So could we do – and please do me a favor?But I think it depends on what happens with her.Well, she’s been there with Obama for a long period of time.They love me.And in my opinion, Janet Yellen is highly political and she’s not raising rates for a very specific reason because Obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn’t want to see a big bubble burst during his administration.In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms.I’m a messenger.God bless you, everybody.We have no choice.He loves the governor.I WOULD HAVE DONE TWO THINGS.(Applause.)The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.Thatâ€™s where they came.The problem is -- the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it's Mexico or Japan or Viet Nam which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or China in particular -- that's the big one.They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.And the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one.It’s my tape.So I said today you know we’ll talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers."They’re Club for Growth."I never liked it.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.It’s very bad for us.So in a way, it’s the most powerful lobbyist – the biggest group of people.And thank you, everybody.Itâ€™s a priority for me, and itâ€™s very important.Let me win Iowa.I would say because Putin is a nicer person than I am.They’re not going to be able to make great trade deals.We also have the support of 16,500 border patrol officers.It’s such a phony number.You just take a look.Itâ€™s a con game.Where are they?Iâ€™m so honored that the Senate approved him.Remember the poll numbers.They donâ€™t want them.I think that’s going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in Washington.You know, it’s called tomorrow night.And they asked a certain general, I’m not going to insult him.It’s a wonderful day."We’re losing our jobs.Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity.(Applause.)Reince â€” you know â€” they donâ€™t care about Reince.Remember that.IT IS AMAZING.More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.I would just call it as â€œthe fastest one to come up with a good verdict.â€  Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d call it.In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.And I’m probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly I haven’t had to spend very much although I guess we just did a recent filing and I would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million.And the next day the headlines – "Trump doesn’t want to defend Japan", "Trump wants Japan to get their nukes".This is a wall you don’t go through so easy.They donâ€™t.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we are helping them a lot and weâ€™ve been very friendly with them.Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge.The Palestinian Authority rejected it also.Thatâ€™s what I hear.They can’t lead us.I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one.I got to know them a couple of months ago when I went down to Texas to the border.And this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country.Great people.Youâ€™re fake news.And we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you."Take me in, oh tender woman,’ sighed the very, very healthy snake.We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.â€  End of problem.Q    Just to be sure â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  But I think ABC, CBS, NBC, the Times, the â€” theyâ€™re all going to endorse me, because if they donâ€™t, theyâ€™re going out of business.When Carrier Air Conditioners, as you know, they just announced they’re moving to Mexico.So believe me, believe me, they’re all establishment.And I think you just read â€” it just came out minutes ago, the small business report â€” small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people.I don’t think it’s right.It can change.THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH CARRIER FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.This is a great, great honor.And the people go after me.It looked, literally, like the Academy Awards.I wanted to – I wish I could find out who she is.Not much.He loves Trump.And itâ€™s been signed many times before.WE HAD A YOUNG MAN WHO DID NOTHING BY COMPARISON TO WHAT SHE DID, AND HE WARNED HIS FRIENDS OF A PROBLEM THAT WAS COMING MILITARILY.The next day, I watched ABC news.So far, I think Iâ€™m batting about 100 percent.Who did it go to?"Few people in high position could have endured or passed this test.And if I would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in Florida, I would have won in my opinion Ohio.It’s important to understand what America First means.It’s just so important because our country has been taken away from us.We’re state government."And you know, you’re talking about 15, 16 people, started with 17.Gen. Douglas MacArthur.And – I mean, we’ll talk about deals after the fact, which is a shame but I think the Iran deal is the worst single thing.Theyâ€™ll say things and then wink at me.We’re going to do this.I will get it built.THE PRESIDENT: Well, not too many.We have a lot of Venezuelans around Doral, the Doral section, right.It’s so much easier if we have it.My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave, to invest in womenâ€™s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.You know, they broke my choppers on that.It’s true.I would have been the headline in every newspaper.We have to get over 50%.So, if I’m rude and if people think I’m rude — I’m actually a nice person.If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?There are too many people.They all have jobs.And we have to build our infrastructure, our roads.But they go to Washington and they’re going to do this and they’re going to do budgets – like I heard the guy before "We’re going to work in the budget."We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of Americaâ€™s poorest workers out of poverty.There are not many people who could have taken the punishment inflicted during this period of time, and yet done so much for the success of America and its citizens.Right?So Ford will come back.School choice is where it's at, folks.The only difference is there’s nothing to pick up if there is zero.You tell me why.It’s a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq.And frankly, if we can make the deal, itâ€™d be my honor to remove them.AND WHAT YOU SAY IS, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO GET THEM BACK.He’ll say, "Mr. President, we’ve decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we’re not going to build it in Mexico."The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.And he’s doing well.But I disavow and hopefully it’s the final time I have to do it.It’s incredible.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.I’m only beating you in your home state by 26 points."They didnâ€™t put themselves â€” and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.Thank you.He’s probably endorsing somebody else but I don’t care.Never been like this.Afterwards, we’re going to sign – I guess got thousands of people on line but we’re going to sign and then later on this evening I’m meeting with Lorne Michaels and the whole staff and we’ll start the preparation.One of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we’re the least prepared now than anytime that he’s ever seen it and he’s been there a long time retiring.On illegal immigration, I’m almost at 50 percent.It's also rated AAA, their bonds are rated AAA.Iâ€™m running to be a president for all Americans.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.Q    Let me â€” wait a minute.African-American communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.Do you want to hear something really shocking?These are the kind of people we have running things.Gonna happen.As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach.Think of it.They don’t want to be killed.You know, now that we’re at it.You get a lot of them that are overrated.What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.I think it’s a catastrophe for Israel.And then Adam comes in.The middle class thrived and median family income increased.Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.What the hell why should they develop it?Our rules and regulations are horrible.Guys want to give me millions.And even then I don’t think you’re going to get to use it really.But we could save a tremendous amount.And they’ll be proud, and they’ll love it, and they’ll make much more than they would’ve ever made, and they’ll be — they’ll be doing so well, and we’re going to be thriving as a country, thriving.I mean, it’s very simple.I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT.I feel young.Itâ€™s one of her real big beliefs.Itâ€™s okay, Jim.You know what I say â€” when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.It won’t be that way for long.Forget it.We have losers.So, Iâ€™ve met with so many victims of Obamacare â€”- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation.And I said to my wife, "Hey, I don’t know if I’ll do well or not.And Iâ€™ll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican senators who â€” look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, â€œWe have George Washington,â€ the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand.Way under budget.But I love Miss Universe and I love the universe.I’ve had some moments where it’s not looking so good, and it’s not a great feeling.They have in Japan the biggest ships you’ve ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in.WE CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.He’s not.Mercedes Benz, how many people have a Mercedes Benz?For three years.I have to read.You know what I’m talking about.We’re going up very strongly in the polls.And they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal.Your new Speaker – how do you like Paul Ryan?Okay?No, I love it.We’re not going to let Carrier and all of these companies just think they can move – go to another country, make their products, sell it back to us, and we get only one thing: We get unemployment.They died for themselves.Okay?It said â€œreset.â€

Now, if I do that, oh, Iâ€™m a bad guy.But you’re going to be hopefully around.He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.I’m going to give it my best.So I started on June 16th and we did well.And I said "Do me this, do this, do this, do that."[ CHEERING ] AND REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING TERRIFIC.THE PRESIDENT:  I understand.Right?Q So when you say theyâ€™re not good, do you mean that they are â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Who did I say is not good?A lot of people were surprised.This was an amazing evening.We use political hacks that don’t know what they’re doing.$140,000 left.I have Carl Icahn.Our nation’s in such trouble.Her bigger problem should be with emails.But I will tell you Mexico has got to help us.PERFECT.So many people have said party unity.You’re going to go out and vote.Now me, I was against the war in Iraq.As part of the global jihad.So we’re not going to let that stuff happen anymore.Thank you.SO I WOULD HAVE SAID, WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, CAN'T DO IT.Believe me, I love this location but I know I can be someplace else.And the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they’re going to come into the country they’re going to be legal, they’re coming in legally, and that’s the way.God bless you, everybody.Look, we’re losing our jobs.We totally destabilized the Middle East.We’ve got a big problem.Now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago.And he did some great…photos.They’re so good.And West Virginia.We lose with trade.We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion.We know that.It’s called Super PACs.Itâ€™s terrible.(Applause.)Frankly, had they reported it, it wouldâ€™ve been pretty amazing, wouldnâ€™t it?Why would politicians want to change a system that’s totally rigged in order to keep them in power?It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.And they said, "He’ll ask for extensions but he’ll never show because he’s probably not as rich as people think."In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.YOU KNOW, WE'RE RUN OF THE HIGHEST TAXED NATIONS IN THE WORLD.I didnâ€™t direct him but I would have directed him because thatâ€™s his job.So we have to see them and we have to say, "You’ve got to help us out."The trade deals are wonderful.Very good question.Nobody knows the system.We lose money with everything.We let them in.It was like a picture.He deserted.When was the last time you heard China is killing us?I’m building on – as you know – Pennsylvania Avenue a big tremendous hotel that I got from the government of the United States.So and So or Mrs.I just want to clarify one other thing.They really want to do things and it’s not going to happen.He denied it.Everybody’s going to live by the same standard.It was fake news.North Korea is a problem.But he’s been so nice to me.So these people â€” and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.You see the airports.That’s the media.Well, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall.To be here is an honor.YOU LOOK AT GENERAL PETRAEUS AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM FOR A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT CROOKED HILLARY DID.He said, â€œThatâ€™s not the 25th Amendment that Iâ€™m looking at.â€  I think I can say that from Mike.If anything, he did something right.What she did was a criminal act.AND WE'RE GOING HAVE COMPASSION.Isn’t that nice?I don’t know if that’s – but they said I’m the only celebrity.And you know what I did today?Even my hats, they’re made in America.They’re afraid to talk to anybody.So when I started this whole quest – I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this?And yet, people pour right through into us, into us.Everybody – think of it, 20,000 people – there wasn’t one heckler in the whole room.Q    Youâ€™re not putting these â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.(Applause.)We don’t win with our vets.But I’ll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can’t move them, right?So I really want to thank you and my volunteers.We lose everything.When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.Mexico is going to pay for it.No, we are making so much progress and it’s been so inspiring to see the people.That means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years.I’ll be tossing and turning.But rather than say why don’t you – could I see a certified check?I’m also talking militarily.They’re fine.And Iâ€™m not doing this from strength or weakness.I have no oil company.I spent no money and I’m number one.It will be simple.But I can tell you, e-mails.We got — I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger — I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger — we got almost 14 million votes.And number two, even if they did attack, it wouldâ€™ve been a whole different story.Which brings me to my next point.We’ve been all over Iowa and we’re going to be here tomorrow.Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.But they are not blue-collar.I think we’re going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals.You’d love everybody.We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.I didnâ€™t watch CNN, but, next time, Iâ€™m going to.You’re going to win.I dominated with the evangelicals.They have no respect for human life.And if we canâ€™t, thatâ€™s fine.We want to get it done.THE PRESIDENT: Weâ€™ll be announcing the order in a little while, and Iâ€™d rather let the order speak for itself.And you’d almost say like it’s about the jobs, it’s about the economy.I think if we continue to create jobs â€” over a million, substantially more than a million.On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I do.(Crosstalk.)Yeah, you have to look at it.That’s their number one weapon.And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.We need this information so badly, and he stopped it.I mean, what they’ve gone through.Iâ€™d be a pretty good reporter â€” not as good as you.One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.Because they would have had it just by saying.(Laughter.)More than that.That commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time.I can see it.Nonsense.We have great, great power.Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.We are bringing education to a local level.The evangelical vote was for Trump.Because somebody put up a sign saying $100.Everybody said Trump was supposed to.He spent $59 million on his campaign and he is down in the grave.WE'RE GOING TO FILL IT UP.Okay?It got worse.But the Super PACs are controlling your candidates – some more than others.By the way, 1% would be unacceptable.But theyâ€™re suffering greatly.And a lot of money is coming into our coffers.I take good care of them.I’m excited.You know what they said â€” you saw it.So we’re bombing.The DNC did not do that.The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers â€” who I love â€” and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.And they’re crying and they’re devastated and they lost their job and they’ve never had another job and now this plant – this whole thing is moving to Mexico.That hurts me and that hurts the people of Israel.But youâ€™re going to have that.They wonâ€™t be.And we're going to buy -- we're going to buy the equipment that our generals, our soldiers, that everybody that's in the know want.They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us.I have a lot of friends.THE PRESIDENT:  It is the winery.There are so many things; there are so many things.(Applause.)You know what they did.Ambulances, fire trucks.Frankly, people still donâ€™t know all of the facts.Remember with the great Bill Rancic.If she’s allowed to run I would be very, very surprised.This guy was I think a former Congressman.Anybody that’s a U.S.THE PRESIDENT: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that heâ€™s not going to be able to make a deal with me because itâ€™s politically not popular for me to make a deal.But I will tell you, if itâ€™s not fully paid â€” because weâ€™re doing a big number, with the planes and the ships â€” our Navy is at World War I levels.I said, â€œI havenâ€™t seen you before.â€  She said, â€œNo, Iâ€™m new.â€  I said, â€œThatâ€™s too bad.â€  Itâ€™s too bad.Thank you.Number one, we’re really good.People that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall.That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.But one thing – I’ve spent to this point almost nothing and I’m in first place by a lot.I didn’t need to do it.I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana.Thank you!Every place — New Hampshire, packed.Outside we have 5,000 people and they can’t get in.Just too many things that I watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made – Bergdahl – where we get Bergdahl and they get five killers.I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower.A total disgrace.So we had thousands outside.Yeah.I am fighting every day for the great people of this country.And you know that I know how to do that.We have Muslim communities in this country that are great, and we have to form that partnership.Thank you!And you know, I’ve met a lot tougher people but I’ve never met any human that lied as much as him.And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date – I won’t tell you what date it was because possibly you’d think I’m younger than that.I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said "You know what?I think we still probably have a very good relationship.And I must have had 12 leaders say it.Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.I appreciate it.I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War.But each time these geniuses would say, "Well, he’s reached his plateau.But I don’t want them coming into this country.But more importantly, they’re taken care of.I think sheâ€™s good.We have already started discussing that situation.And we are more than double everybody.This room canâ€™t handle two.We had an amazing event in Massachusetts.Right?I took a lot of heat and then you had Kate in San Francisco, killed, shot in the back and so many others.One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues.No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, "Oh, your hands are very nice.We are going to save it because we are going to make our country rich again.All of a sudden he’s got $2 million sitting there.I mean, just an amazing woman.Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform.And I predict that I’m going to win the Hispanic vote.England?And certain cases, even the media agrees with that.We have a presidential election coming up.We have a really good chance to win.Now, could they start up again?Q    Youâ€™re talking about me, but (inaudible).But he became radicalized quickly.And I’ll go over – there are other names.It’s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering bigly and it’s getting worse.But still, we have 50 million.I said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because you’re going to ruin the balance.Itâ€™s not terrible â€” itâ€™s good.But it’s got to be smart trade.Right?And the people mentioned in the story â€” I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.Looking good is very important, right?Many of them zero.It will make us look better.But if I didn’t bring it up, nobody would be talking about it.We have so many other things.And — but she’s playing that card.(Applause.)And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time.We’re going to win a lot — if I get elected, we’re going to win a lot.And another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, "Good morning ladies and gentlemen.And he insulted the people of Iowa by doing a voter violation form that nobody’s ever seen before which was disgraceful.And we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids – they go over there.We’re backing you 100%...We are backing you 100%.We’re going to become a wealthy country again.I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.Whether it’s militarily or trade.Then youâ€™ll probably get some votes.We can – I’m not saying I’m perfect because I’m not perfect.I’m not going to let them move to Mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through.But you donâ€™t make statements that direct unless you know the facts.We have done far more â€” I think maybe more than anybodyâ€™s done in this office in 50 days, that I could tell you.Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform without restriction. It’s called Freedom of Speech remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!(Applause.)They’re taking so many of our companies.Q Tax reform â€”

Q Mr. President, since you â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.Q    Thank you, sir.Thank you.I said, how much?And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.The drugs are pouring into our country, folks.Okay?And we have not forget â€” we donâ€™t forget â€” I donâ€™t forget.This you’ll get a kick out of.And your rates are going up 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent.Right?BUT IT WAS PRETTY NASTY.Some of the signs youâ€™ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, theyâ€™re put up by the other side, and you think itâ€™s like playing it straight.In 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instructions.I beat China all the time.Q    Was it in your administration or your Cabinet?I’ve dealt with them all my life.It’s beautiful what’s happening.I said "Oh, I’m used to watching it.We’re going to take care of our – I’m the most conservative on Common Core.To me, it’s really special because it’s a person that I think is a spectacular person.It’s going to need to — it’s going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation, and they’re so rich now.It's a scandal.Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.THE PRESIDENT:  I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?And you know all about the summit.Right?He sent it to them.Just remember this:  If we submitted the Democratsâ€™ plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldnâ€™t get one vote from the Democrats.Got a beautiful wife and children and I’m not going to destroy a man for that.And I’m saying but I have like millions of votes more.Can I take – " One man offered me – a big lobbyist – offered $5 million for my campaign.He came in last.When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars.India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.Fantastic guy.Weâ€™re going to put our great coal miners back to work.They’re pouring in and we don’t know what we’re doing.At the polls.Our infrastructure is a disaster.(Applause.)I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.SHE USES THE WORD TEMPERAMENT BUT I LOVE WHEN SHE USES THE WORD TONE.They’re not stupid.And in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, we’ve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions – by many millions more – than anybody who’s ever run.Hold up that sign for the cameras.I backed McCain; he lost by the way.We gave them Iraq.So will George Washington now lose his status?I don’t know what’s going on.So many cameras.Okay?We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals — and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination.So weâ€™re getting out.I want these companies not to leave Chicago, not to leave Michigan, not to leave New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and all of these places where they’re leaving and they’re going to other countries.…Because the country is doing so poorly.One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757.We have nothing.I think he possibly did.But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader.(Applause.)Because I wasn’t supposed to run.This is out of books.Not good.And that just wasnâ€™t acceptable to me.But we’re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.We are totally predictable.We have a lot to be proud of.It’d be a whole different story.It used to be a small group, and now itâ€™s in large sections of the world.(Applause.)And she was so supportive and she’s been so supportive.And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.THE PRESIDENT: I do that.I told them."There are so many things we’re going to do.Now, I could have settled that case.I am?One of these guys just got two.It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax breaks, reduced the number of tax brackets from fifteen to two, and lowered tax rates for both individuals and businesses.And one of these guys who’s at two said, "He always talks about his polls and I don’t."Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.So bad.GOOD FATHER.Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation.I’m self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not.I think the two-state is more likely.Take a look.They have to pay.Q If I may just â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.Q Iâ€™m just trying to find out what youâ€™re doing to do about them, Mr. President.Who knows?Oh, what a day that was.We lost our way when we stopped believing in our country.But he is one hell of a competitor.$1 billion a day.So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.Q Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?It’s not going to happen.Thank you and congratulations.What a job you did.The numbers speak and things happen, but Iâ€™ve always really had a very good press.Q Can you just say yes or no on it?One of the great movements of all time.(Applause.)Now you just booed Obamacare.And it will be very interesting."He’ll never run because he’ll never want to file various papers.Great President.I think he left.I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.So why don’t you say "Hey, Yemen out"?They’re actually very nice.Iâ€™ve heard 80 percent â€” I find that hard to believe; thatâ€™s just a number I heard â€” that theyâ€™re overturned 80 percent of the time.Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second.So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh?Does that make any sense to anybody?BUT I LEARNED A LOT.By the way, without eminent domain, you wouldn’t have highways, you wouldn’t have hospitals, you wouldn’t have bridges.Think of this.The 5% – totally phony numbers.I will tell you, the question â€” somebody said today, â€œWell, this is the first news conference in a long time.â€  I said, â€œWhat do you mean?He came up to my office like about a year ago before I did – you know, I’ve been a politician for about eight months, right?And also, weâ€™ve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.VERY IMPORTANT.Our party is expanding.They’re going to build in Mexico.And that’s like a prizefighter.But you have to hit back hard, and you can’t let them push you around.They did it all over Florida.50 million people in poverty.And Hillary Clinton will never do anything about it.He’s been one of the great dividers of all time.I want really immaculate air.No, it’s true.I guarantee you that within 24 hours, they would have called back and they’ll say, "You’ve got your prisoners; can we talk?"I love doing it.He’s finished.I almost said, "Maybe I’ll just never leave" and it resonated somehow and we have a tremendous victory tonight.But people knew that.The numbers are astronomical.WE'RE LOSING ON TRADE.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I wasnâ€™t happy with Roy Moore.Nobody.We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important.Thank you.Thank you very much.Very bad for the safety and security of our country.AND THEY WILL.The only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.He wouldn’t let them do it.AUDIENCE:  USA!So women have always appreciated that about me.I mean, what he did was absolutely wrong.We need money.I will be always defending the Second Amendment.I’ve been here for a long time.Incredible.I just choose not to.Then we immediately start on the tax cuts, and theyâ€™re going to be really fantastic, and I am looking forward to that one.And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me.We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico.You have so many people — they call all these business people — call.They say walls donâ€™t work.And we’re going to really take care of our military.So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are?We did a great job with that company – Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA.We’re just not going to let it happen.So it wasn’t like I won and then I disappeared.But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising.And it did.Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.The $75 billion a year that we’re short on with Japan.And your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really long, slow, vicious death, youâ€™re never going to be able to use it, OK. Do you see the deductibles?And they’re making him do it because he’s crashing in the polls.I talk about industry.That will end, and it’ll end soon, believe me.And I mean on both sides in all fairness.Q    Can you tell us how youâ€™re feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon?He’s going to be fine.So I’m going to give him total credit.You can't give somebody another chance, 'cause actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president.We tell everything.But he said, "Yeah, I’m the only one who can beat Donald Trump.And I just said, "Let’s go" to my wife.No, I think we’re going to do really well here.You’re going to get so sick of me.So you canâ€™t be talking about that.They drew nothing, but now they’re drawing 24 million.And I want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep Ben totally involved because we’re going to win.Well, in Europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming.They refused to even write about it.I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us.2,000?Weâ€™ve cut more regulations in one year, and we have a ways to go.The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States.We beat the record of Elton John.Okay?Heâ€™s doing the job.But he has one problem.We’ve been doing this for a year and a half.Ford will say "If I (inaudible) pay a tax, we’re going to stay in the United States."They think they are.Our country has tremendous potential.And there are many examples.Look, at a certain point in life, what you do is you say, "I’m one in 32.I’d never heard of him.You people – a lot of military people here.But it’s Trump at 33%.See ya, Iâ€™m going home.You canâ€™t take human traffic â€” women and girls â€” you canâ€™t take them through ports of entry.I’ll tell it like it is.I just think this is a common sense approach.I’ll give you one point, which I think is important.We gave them $150 billion.And I can tell you that about many leaders.And we can’t let it happen.I DIDN'T WANT TO GO FROM THE BEGINNING, AND I HAVE PROOF FROM THE BEGINNING.Quinnipiac poll – very respected 31% for Trump, 29% for Cruz.AND THEY CAME DOWN ON HIM WITH A VENGEANCE.That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly.Right?But you watch this devaluation of all of it.But I don’t care.He handle that very nicely.And honestly, he’s a nice person.So we will change our laws because you really have no choice.We don’t even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don’t understand the game.And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end.I mean, you go to Qatar, you go to — some people say Qatar, but you go to Qatar, you go to any of — so many places.Well, you don’t have to be met when you’re at 2%.Representative Ann Wagner.I’m not knocking it.It needs money.Youâ€™re going to have to buy more.â€  Theyâ€™re buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing.For the different positions of â€œSecretary of Thisâ€ and â€œSecretary of Thatâ€ and all of these great positions, Iâ€™d see five, six, seven, eight people.Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate, and failed.And I think you know look we’re doing well.The Democrats agree it should be brought back in.And we did a strong number.We’ve beaten him in most of the states.Think of it.Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot.Why did they wait so long?Okay, you feel good about Boeing right now.Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.And then he’ll never file this and that and then you’d have to sign your life away."It was a love fest.I think they should demonstrate.Some of the smartest people have said "What Trump said is genius.And now, I’m going to fight for you, the American people like nobody has ever fought before.Are you crazy?"He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims.I wanted to know the facts.These are the people that got hurt fighting for us.I got it right from you folks, okay?I’ve never been a politician.Think of it.He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies.And then I see this story on CNN last night.Rich guy.From the Guardian.(Applause.)I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top — the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders — people are going to be surprised to hear that — I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?You can always have bad apples.Wounded warriors who I love all over the place.Just talk.And he did this, and he got it done.History will not forget what he did.I don’t care about CNN.I mean, where have we had a victory?People that we’ve let go of at Gitmo have now killed Americans.That means less than zero.We’ve been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades.And it was virtually more than doubled.Q    When the allegations first surfaced, you initially said how important it was for Dr. Ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her.Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is.If we lower our taxes and weâ€™re getting a massive tax reduction â€” and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially.Believe me.Q    And you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind about it?I AM NOT AN ISOLATIONIST, I'M A FREE TRADER.I’ve been with so many pastors lately and Jerry Falwell Jr. was an example – was telling me that – first of all, he told me something that "You remind me so much of my father."Stupid.It was right after.They don’t want to hear it.Letâ€™s see what happens.THE PRESIDENT:  I donâ€™t think so.They will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want.My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border.Right.And very important.I’m going to do great with Japan.Q    Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?And think of it: In some cases, way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes, in various states.Believe me.FOLKS, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.It’s an amazing process.Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals.I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.We don’t have a country that can do this anymore.Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security.Doesn’t it?But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.AND YET IN GOING AROUND AND MEETING WITH PEOPLE, SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE, BIG BUSINESS PEOPLE, IF THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE, AND IF THEY HAD THEIR CHOICE, THEY WOULD RATHER GET RID OF RULES AND REGULATION -- WE HAVE THE WORST REGULATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.She’s back there.So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big.But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month â€” the bad ones.And frankly, I’m disgusted with it and I’m tired of seeing it and there’s no reason for it.A friend a mine.We watched this.But I didn’t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel.Great guy.And these people want these deductions.So you know there’s tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets.I love the people.I mean I liked him.We’re leading in Texas.Now he’s getting out of the race.But it’s a horrible thing that’s taking place.I want to be an outsider.Ever?We can’t even go there.Remember this – they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money.(Applause.)(Laughter.)Yes.I can’t take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money – my whole life I’ve been taking money.(Applause.)Six people killed…They get five of their greatest killers that they’ve been after – after – think of it for six years.But nobody talks about that.And now we are looking only to the future.And they make it sound like he had a victory and I didn’t.That’s an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%.And we can do it.But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.Okay, so we’re going to say Merry Christmas again folks.But when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that’s not going to happen.I took a lot of heat.We have great people.We’re killing everybody in every poll.I HAVE A LIST.SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE.Our country has no spirit.Now, are we going to take down his statue?The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known.Highly respected.It’s on the ceiling of this incredible club in Jupiter, Florida, and we’re all leaving and we have a press conference.Who the hell knows?"I believe it.It’s a scam.Weâ€™re going to do a great job for companies.I think it should be â€” I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.And I want them to come back.You’ve got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyone’s happy.I didnâ€™t do anything for Russia.I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that Iâ€™m creating jobs, I think thatâ€™s going to have a tremendous impact â€” positive impact on race relations.And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while Americaâ€™s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We are the largest purchasers of drugs in the world, the United States...which makes a lot of sense I guess.Because we’re going to do great.And the same things happen with these politicians.Now I do politics.â€  I will tell you, Iâ€™m very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster.We’re not going to have it any more.Weâ€™re going to fix our inner cities.I was before June 16th, I was a part of the establishment and they will do not what’s right for you but they will do what’s right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the United States continues to get ripped off, ripped off, ripped off.Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela â€” (applause) â€” and its new President, Juan GuaidÃ³.But I do think this – and I do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons I’m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that Israel has given a lot.And we have to do it.So we have people that don’t know what they’re doing.So they leave the money over there.But we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds.You have Jamiel in Los Angeles killed.So I’m looking forward to getting to the signings.It’s caused by a doctor’s medical negligence.If I could do that, it would make me so happy because there’s so much violence, so much death, and just been going on for so many years.He is reading it.Thank you, Blaine.Many of you know who she is.He just forgot.I’m never going to let you down.Jobs, jobs, jobs.Maybe it’s not so nice.But many other communities, including you, but many other communities have this problem.They get it.And Iâ€™ll tell you, weâ€™re spending a lot of money on the inner cities.We’re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again.And I was kidding.In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.So Iâ€™m thinking about doing something very different.I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start — and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers.Incredible.The citizens of Texas and the Gulf Coast need all the prayers, support, and resources our communities have to offer.So when Chris talks about – when he talks about lack of experience – I built this incredible company.Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand.He couldn’t answer the question.We take them out by the thousands.Elton John.But we can turn this all around.My wife, Melania.No, come on.That’s why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder I think will greatly help.We need bilateral trade deals.Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States â€” (applause) â€” and citizens of America:

Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nationâ€™s path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.Q â€” in our news media.No, no, no.Right now, I’m interested in jobs.We’re going to have good borders.JUST LIKE WE HAVE SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN, AND WHAT THEY DID TO HIM AND YOU BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING AND WHAT HE GAVE AWAY, ISRAEL IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY, FRANKLY WE'RE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY, AND WE MADE A POWER OUT OF IRAN.I gave $350,000 to the Republican Governors Association.They expect me.What are your plans to reverse it?And broke it by $10 million â€” thatâ€™s not so close.Q    I wanted to come back to China, because I think what you announced today was really important.And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama.We have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles, because you have a lot of natural barriers, right, that are extremely tough to get across.The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons.I would speak to her; I have nothing against her.We have 1,000 miles.And I’m happy to do it.Chris Christie.They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood.It could be nine, could win nine states tonight.But we have places in this country that we have to fix.I appreciate it.Right?We’re never going to have to use it.By the ways, speaking of increase, Cruz and Kasich want to destroy your Social Security, folks, okay?The spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible.And we can’t go on like this any longer.AND WE'RE GOING TAKE CARE OF THOSE PROBLEMS.Never.I said, "Steve, I’m going to run."I have a license to carry.Not too good.We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed.America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration.We speak in rooms like this.A soldier appeared.Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.So when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he’s got control of her.Okay?Until I was criticized – so I’m the only one in the world that could raise almost $6 million for the veterans, have uniform applause by the veterans’ groups, and end up being criticized by the press.And isnâ€™t that a shame, because heâ€™d rather be working on health care.I mean, those were the ones that liked…So you know I saved those things.Sometimes, it is not as much like what you say, it’s how did you look?Are the â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think thereâ€™s blame on both sides.But if you’re a businessperson and you want to go to the bank for a loan, you can’t get it.We need that – whatever it is.We’re like the stupid country in so many different ways.Thank you, Matthew.I didn’t say everybody.Can I read this to you?I didn’t think they moved.We have speakers outside.We have such bad deals.They want to make America great again.The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.All of them.I love that.Theyâ€™re doing this because they feel it, both of them.I’m not angry.And you know, one group that’s been so incredible to me are the vets – the veterans.Will you be pulling out of NAFTA?Q If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.And some of them tried to do it.Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.But the money has been paid out.And I said it strongly "Don’t go.When I say...






... folks, when I say, "We’re going to build a wall."This event just happened.And then it goes to 18%.Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it’s obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension…
Where the hatred comes from and why, we’ll have to determine.Weâ€™re talking about mountains.It won’t be like – because right now, what we’re doing is we’re approving it, we’re not really getting anything.That’s what’s happening to our country and we can’t let it happen.Jobs.(Applause.)And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil.You know that, right?Kurds right now, after the defeat of ISIS, are under a lot of pressure in Syria and in Iraq by many adversaries.But, you know, I started and I started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%.I’m not changing, including with her.I’m putting up my own money.We’re going to win again.But I just want to say it’s a great state, and they have great people.I mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond.If I’m one minute off, they’ll call me because they love Hillary.Great.I HAD A GOOD FATHER.We had 31,000 people and it was the most unbelievable.SPEECH 6: President Donald J. Trump Inaugural Address - Jan. 20, 2017

Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.But other than that, you probably wonâ€™t get any, John.It’s not the way it’s supposed to be.Maybe it is.You werenâ€™t supposed to do that.We’re going to have strong borders.Be very careful.They came up to my office, the head of Comcast – great guy – I won’t use names.Iâ€™ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads, and families.But it is tough.There is no way to “fix” the TPP.Bill Clinton.It’s going to be easy.We’ve got a lot of problems.You’re going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs.Thank you.Now here’s the story.And we will make sure that that takes place.I said, "How can I say that?We’re not going to approve, as somebody just said, the TransPacific Partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular Mexico.When you are guilty until proven innocent, itâ€™s just not supposed to be that way.And together, we will endure and we will overcome.We’re going to bring back our companies.The regulations were strangling our country.THE PRESIDENT:  Itâ€™s time to embrace our glorious American destiny.You’re here at one of them.He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power.You have an agenda.The Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return.But they’re building massive – now, they had little islands.John Wayne was a strong guy.Itâ€™s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.They were laughing at the United States saying that this deal is great.And then as soon as we left, they come in OK?And honestly, he’s not going to win.Hard to believe.Soon as I saw him it was like â€” an interview lasted for about 30 seconds â€” I said, heâ€™s the right guy.ARE YOU READY?Because you were asked earlier in the news conference about Brett â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Say it again.We’re going to bring back our jobs.And it all started â€” without the WTO, China is not China as we know it today.He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.Isn’t it?Mr. President, please, we donâ€™t need that much backing.Protect your freedoms, and defend the Second Amendment.That’s what we want because it’s going to be an exciting period of time.And he’s saying "Well, ISIS is very tough.But I’m forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.But everybody â€” people knew that.So instead of saying they made a mistake — call it a typo, they made a mistake — they’re trying to justify it.…I’ll go anyway they want.So they wanted strong financials.I’ve toured Pennsylvania.We would get â€” we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.The insurers are fleeing.But when you think of it, look, out of all of these Senators, he has one supporter – Lee – who’s his friend.The momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that's because my father's message resonants so deeply with so many people.Now they think when the new numbers come out they’ll be even substantially higher than that.We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable.And, I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on.Weâ€™re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.I’m not going to forget it.Doesn’t he have something better, he should go home.Oh boy.He said, â€œI have nominated youâ€¦â€ or â€œRespectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize.â€  I said, â€œThank you.â€  Many other people feel that way too.It’s not going to happen.I’ll give you another example.TRUMP: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who we all love all over the place.We need new leadership.Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds.Hi, Ann.Together, we will defend our freedoms.It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need.That is almost false advertising, isn’t it?For many decades, Route 66 captured the American spirit.And then Iâ€™ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe â€” for some remaining deals.We get along.Expected to go for another four years.How do you write a letter like that?We’re withering away.For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years â€” 13.And itâ€™s going to go quickly.Weâ€™re taking a lot of money from that realm also.For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.And you know it’s a six-year year statute.Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible time for us — were attacked.Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.(Applause.)This was a â€” I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare.And more money is going to come in I believe over the next little while too.Thank you.Now, these are checks that have been delivered, that have been cashed, that are now being used to help the vets.But you’re going to see.Clean coal.And we stand up here and we talk.Okay?You know, a lot of politicians have said "Oh, they’re not going to pay".When they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats.93 million people.I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China.Thank you.Our vets have been abandoned.Are you all Republicans?But I order thousands of televisions, they’re all from South Korea.What do they do when they have zero?THIS STUFF HAS GOT TO STOP, FOLKS.So they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people.I have no loans in Russia.What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.Billy.Shifted a mountain.You know, she’s become so famous.Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea.Q    Rudaw Media Network from Kurdistan region, north of Iraq.Nobody has guns.And people are going to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a legal process.Maybe five but it’s probably six.24 days – 24 days – we think there’s something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it’s much longer than that because there’s a whole process before the clock starts ticking.We have to talk about it to find out whatâ€™s going on, because the press honestly is out of control.I think they like you.You’re all watching.I say, what?How do we do it?"But we didn’t talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country – massive companies – because they can’t get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere.I backed Romney, he lost.Because if I would have made a fast statement â€” and the first statement was made without knowing much, other than what we were seeing.But you know, we won’t wait.But you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesn’t have a problem.I would sit back â€” I was in business â€” and I could see what was happening.So the fake news said, â€œPeople laughed at President Trump.â€  They didnâ€™t laugh at me.Weâ€™ll be the cleanest.And he said we are in the worst shape we’ve been in many, many decades.That’s the end."Now, maybe somebody is going to tell me that’s wrong but again these are – $45 billion.Q    With the microphone and prepared for questions.Meaning somebody else is picking up...At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?I’m putting up my own money.Nobody would be that stupid.Great weather.I know the vets.I know youâ€™ll do a great job.And they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith.But they were not ignored by me, and theyâ€™re not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer.So, our theme when we started and Melania and I came down.Are you ready?We made a deal for Iran, done by some of the dumbest people on earth, on our side.Aye!Itâ€™s a big deal.They’re fine.We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.Millions of our citizens are out of work.We have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before.I think I have 67%, 68% in New York compared to like 10% or whatever, and you have Cruz talk about New York values, New Yorkers are no good.51% of the Muslims living in this country – by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they’re great people.But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally.Our schools are failing.Everyone else, no good.And it’s not going to happen.48% is pretty good.They’re disgusted with the people that are giving our country away.She’s going to have to follow his line because she’s on a thread.Friend or foe?And I’m telling you had I not brought it up, it has turned out to be – and I took heat.It’s the tremendous power.But their leaders are killing us because they’re smarter, sharper, more cunning.We need in our country law and order.The city of Pittsburgh, and the State of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO.We’re nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per pupil.Made in America.We have agreements with several of them already.And we’ll check it out and be careful.And you know what?Remember that.Which question?Well, he’ll never file his financials because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks."As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi, were the words "Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m signing today.No, he’s screaming at me.It’s just make America great again.They’re controlled, you know, with the lobbyists in Washington.Ready?It was during the Johnson.Iconic assets.(Applause.)You know, there’ve been 60,000 negative ads.You have a top show and you say, "I’m not doing it anymore.If you look at some of those people that youâ€™re talking about theyâ€™re outside of the country, theyâ€™re having a lot of their product made outsider.And a big majority of the big drugs â€” the big drug loads â€” donâ€™t go through ports of entry.The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony.She would go home at night and didnâ€™t even want to go out with people.Good guy.(Applause.)Honestly, nobody.And she’s going through a very hard time.Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.And I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.Our most exciting journeys still await.Our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief.But she’s got a sort of close race.We need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with.You donâ€™t hear that as much.But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that â€” some other lightweight â€” he was probably told â€” he was probably told, donâ€™t meet with Trump, itâ€™s bad politics.They don’t.WE DON'T HAVE IT.I’m saying what about corporate inversions?They do negative ads.It’s terrible.It blew up.So I actually don’t think it’d hurt that much because I don’t think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be stupid enough to give a date – "We’re leaving on this date."I know every one of them.They’re so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out.Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example.YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING SINCE BILL CLINTON SIGNED PROBABLY THE WORST DEAL ECONOMICALLY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, NAFTA.You know, right now, we have a false – 5.4%, 5.3%, 5.6% – every month it’s different.BUT WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT SOME TROOPS THERE, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, CERTAINLY, THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW.Won’t be as good as the one I’m going to build but it’s a wall.Scum.But to me it’s like a painting when you could do something like that.Well, you know when you end the repatriation, when you get the money coming back in beyond, tremendous things happen.Iâ€™m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so Iâ€™m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.We’re going to knock them out.So we’re going to take care of our vets and we’re going to take care of the VA and it’s going to be one of the things we’re going to be releasing pretty soon.We can’t make our country great if we’re going to be poor.Our country doesn’t feel good about itself.But you don’t want people like Harwood that read a question – blah, blah, blah – that he wrote – that he carefully wrote.(Applause.)Right?Iâ€™ll tell you what, I just â€” I told you I just left Little Haiti.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.But itâ€™s been hurt very badly by Socialist Venezuela.And new frontiers in science, technology and space that inspire the next generation of American youth.I mean, nobody has done the job that weâ€™ve done on the border.We’re going to win, win, win, and we’re not stopping.It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own.I get sued all the time, okay.OUR JOBS ARE GOING TO COME BACK.I mean it.They’re not being responsible because we’re losing a lot of people because of the Internet.In fact, everybody said, â€œHis statement was beautiful.(Applause.)What I want...


What I want is common sense.I said, â€œWhat were you going to use it for?â€  And I wonâ€™t go into details, but it didnâ€™t sound too important to me.It’s make America great.But I believe that the fact that I brought in â€” it will be soon â€” millions of jobs â€” you see where companies are moving back into our country â€” I think thatâ€™s going to have a tremendous, positive impact on race relations.Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.Regulation is stealth taxation.Thatâ€™s right, she just opened up the Visitors Center â€” in other words, touring of the White House.Q    Can I ask a follow-up?So that’s the way it is...






I’m glad you asked the question because I have to tell you I have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets – almost $6 million.Then I go into a race, we go into New Hampshire.I’ll tell you if they don’t they’re not so smart.What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.But after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team?"(Applause.)Good job.Right?He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."Unbelievable.And to put Americans first again.But I just donâ€™t speak to her.Unabated.Got to go home to mommy.Q So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.SO WE'RE GOING TO TURN THINGS AROUND.So maybe I can’t.They took the oil.One hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals.And I don’t want to get into it because they won’t understand it.He never did a deal.That’s what’s happened in our country.I’m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again.(Laughter.)And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast.What happened is he got out.(Applause.)Anything at all that â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I wonâ€™t get into that game.We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations.We’re going to make America great again, folks.Because you know, I think they have lower â€” I heard, lower than Congress.We shouldn’t have done Iraq.Okay?You know what’s happening."And itâ€™s happened to me many times, where false statements are made.The kings, the emirs, the absolute leaders from every â€” there was nobody in second place.They’re great people.And I’ve even seen it where they keep graduates – the child graduates and those parents stay on.And I will tell you that the consultants are rich people.The Republicans and the Democrats totally agree that the money should come back.It’s Democrats.He did Survivor, Apprentice.They’re going to have Iran.I saw it with the Romney campaign.(Applause.)And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.And he talked about – that’s inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right?And I was greatly honored that he did come up frankly.We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.We can’t have China ripping us off and Mexico and Japan and Vietnam.So they put it down as serious.You can’t let people tell lies.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.They have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour and we have things that go chug, chug, chug, chug like from 100 years ago.But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier.But — and we’ll see what happens.Now, if Canada doesnâ€™t make a deal with us, weâ€™re going to make a much better deal.So I’m at 48%.WE NEED LAW AND ORDER, AND WE NEED STRENGTH IN THIS COUNTRY.I win at golf.I have to say this: It can also be a very positive subject because I believe so strongly in immigration and I just – we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner.Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East.If we have to live with him, we still beat him easily.Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.What’s happened in Iowa.THE PRESIDENT:  You know, the one thing I didnâ€™t understand about Belinda â€” I thought they were married maybe five or six years, because look how they look so young.You get one question.No one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that’s based on competence.You know, the whole grid is a disaster.Thatâ€™s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.She’s a nice woman.The reason is he doesn’t know how to make a deal, probably doesn’t work at it, probably doesn’t care, but you’re talking about tremendous number of — tremendous amounts of money.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child.That’s just — you know, because I see since then — I mean, just — you can’t turn on this television without these commercials.Thank you very much.I think John Roberts would tell you that â€” you covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me.I’m a Republican.It has to stop.We can save our country.And God helped me.So here’s what’s happening.RIGHT NOW WE LOSE ALL OF THIS MONEY.and they said, "Just Second Amendment.I’ll tell you, Christianity is under siege.You know, on a network that doesnâ€™t like me very much â€” which is most of them â€” but a network that didnâ€™t â€” doesnâ€™t really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers.Already, as a result of my administrationâ€™s efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.Then all of a sudden Obama, because he couldn’t get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like they’re butter.Q And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about â€” you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.THE PRESIDENT: We are.How about Germany taking millions of migrants.Unbelievable cash flow.That’s right.I was just informed...that we’ve got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries and we still have I guess six or seven locations to go, states to go.It’s going to be up to $21 trillion.It was also Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012.And I appreciate that.You don’t want them in South Carolina.It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes.(Applause.)When you have a $58 billion deficit, and you have a $10 billion wall, that’s real easy.I’m going to be good for women’s health issues.We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in.Great, right at the best location.Right?His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.You know why they’re doing well?I want them to stay here and they will stay here and they’ll be so happy.Remember I was supposed to lose that one big and we won by 21 points.WE WANT TO GET TO BUSINESS, RIGHT?Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.There’s an example of something where everybody agrees – all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can’t get it done because they’re politicians.You know, to a certain extent, I’d rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess.So, we have to do it.He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree.Jerusalem stone, one of my favorite stones.But you know what?It’s got to be much more than that.(Laughter.)But weâ€™re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot.I don’t know.That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.The third principle for tax reform is a crucial one: tax relief for middle-class families.Well, he’s the Speaker.They’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico.Everybody – Rand Paul attacked me.And one of the commentators, who I think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if Donald Trump gets 25 percent of the African-American vote, this election is over.Now, I’m talking as a person financially.Very, very strongly.We have tremendous developments in Miami on the water and Doral in particular has been a tremendous, tremendous thing.Weâ€™ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.We can’t beat ISIS.And we must always keep faith in Americaâ€™s destiny that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise, and the light and the glory, among all the nations of the world.I said, you’ve got to pay your bills.Call us when you’re ready."It’s Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts — (CHEERS) — Tennessee, Virginia.Now, I don’t know that they do that.I didn’t want the trigger.In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay?Todayâ€™s ceremony, however, has very special meaning.Yes?But itâ€™ll probably or possibly be just â€œUSM.â€  Itâ€™ll be United States and Mexico.The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history.And Corey and Hope, the staff, the whole group, and Charles and Dan and what a group we have.And the money comes in.A lot of controversy with Mr. Singer.It’s true.And Don went to _____, you were all over, right?(Laughter.)And the evangelicals – he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they don’t like liars and they see he lies so much.We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS.I mean, if you call that obstruction, thatâ€™s fine.But for $10, okay?The media talks about home grown terrorism but Islamic radicalism and that’s a very, very important term — a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don’t like it.But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country, which has been so good to me and to my family.So we’re going to have a nice simple tax return.So your population is higher.Can you believe it?In the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment they’ll be saying "Okay, it’s a good thing" because they’ll be beneficiaries also.Thereâ€™s no place Iâ€™d rather be than with all of you here tonight, with the wonderful, hardworking citizens of our country.And that’s going to be broken down into something that’s going to be very special.(Applause.)They need real power behind them.We see it.They make so much money from the United States it’s going to be one of the easiest things.I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things.So we sent out – I think I had – and it’s not me.But we’re going to end Obamacare.We can’t beat ISIS.I don’t want them coming here.She went home.You know, to nothing.Some really disgusting people back there.But the illegal immigration – you know, I did this and I made my determination – I took a deep breath.Unbelievable.And how about the woman?Theyâ€™re put out by people either in agencies.So we have a wonderful group of people thatâ€™s working very hard, thatâ€™s being very much misrepresented about, and we canâ€™t let that happen.She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the “gold standard”.It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed.Remember, itâ€™s going to take your jobs, Ohio.It’s all of us.All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.Thank you, fellas.And for years, I’ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster.(Applause.)You have China, you have Norway, Swenden, Denmark and then you have number 30, the United States.I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries.They are so dishonest.They want our veterans taken care of.Yes, go ahead.(Laughter.)And Michigan—the whole thing.But I’ve done this for a long time, and I’ve seen ups and downs.They think we’re playing games.We have the largest audience in the history of cable television.And we’re going to bring back our jobs.But I am a great Christian.I SAY ABSOLUTELY.And Iâ€™m so beautifully represented.And so many more.Do I know how to build a wall?The other week – two weeks ago in Mobile, Alabama, 31,000 people showed up in a rainy rough day.You know, number one, I like the way it is now but I want them to pay a lot more money.And my first question is, why is the tax reform â€” why has it been of such a high priority for your administration?You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish.WE BRING OUR EDUCATION BACK TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS LOCAL COMMUNITY WHERE THE PEOPLE LOVE THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN BE WELL EDUCATED.As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that.They let her out.They would have said, "No, we won’t do that."Many of you were there; probably all of you were there.So, very, very strongly we started talking about that.Ivanka Trump, very much for child care.She’s got no strength.We have to have the Republicans hold fast because I’m just hearing these little cracks, saying "Well, maybe if he appoints somebody, maybe we could get along, maybe."Thank you all very much.The evangelicals have been unbelievable.WE HAVE A PROBLEM.Right?They take advantage of the United States.Put on your business.And he just kept going back.Theyâ€™ll spend their money.We have an administration that will not change.Okay.You know, I’ve been saying $18 [trillion] for a while now.So when I call for moratoriums and I call for this, first I get hit with tremendous heat.I didn’t have to do this with the money for the vets but I decided to because I thought it would be a good idea.I could be very happy.It’s the only thing you can do.And we will enforce it like you’ve never seen a contract enforced before folks.Nobody’s leaving here except for the one person that was screaming.Remember that.I was told be nice to Paul Ryan because – really?Itâ€™s the agenda of the American people.AND I SAY IT ONCE, AND I SAY IT WITH LOVE, AND I SAY IT WITH COMPASSION.We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.He is.But weâ€™re not going to let it happen, because Iâ€™m here again to take my message straight to the people.Thank you.But it won’t.I shouldn’t say that because you’re not supposed to want things like that so badly.Let me give you the bad news.How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics?Youâ€™re African-American.Itâ€™s a one-way street out of the United States for our jobs and our money.They’re bringing drugs.But I was talking to – I probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors, different folks came up to my office, and they’re really under tremendous pressure because they don’t want to have their tax exempt status taken away.The fact is we have to bring our party together.Stand up Mr. Cook.He gives an exact date and so they pull back.I run a big business.We get nothing by comparison.And all of a sudden, people are coming over, and I say the wall and now they’re starting to say the wall.Here in America Iâ€™ll push to expand freedom for all of our citizens.Did you know that?Thank you.You’re their next door neighbor.You know, when somebody’s paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it’s nice to see a good name.They said, "How are you going to get them to pay?"Now, they’re not even going through the motions.She had a tough night.Youâ€™re the one that wrote about them and reported them.Welcome.Can’t get it over there because the tax is so massive that he’s now selling in this country because China won’t let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax.The Iran deal.He hasn’t won anything, period.No, they’re very dishonest.No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit.So I said we’re going to do this and I had no idea it was going to work this way.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers left behind.But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats.Thank you very much, everybody.This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.And with me, when I use it nobody criticizes me.And we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that.They are so dishonest.BUT WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY.And one of the things that’s really been amazing to me, and such — it’s been so beautiful to watch — the level of genius in the public.But saying they want to get it done.We need to know, and we need to make sure, every single last person involved in this plan, including anyone who knew something but didn’t tell us, is brought to justice, so when people know what’s going on and they don’t tell us, and we have an attack, and people die, these people have to have consequences.Cory, good job, Cory.No, no, it’s sad.We’re going to run it.And then he decided to go into the military.And you know, the law is rough.Sir?So tonight we had 45 to 46%, and tomorrow you’d hear them say, you know, if they could just take the other candidates and add them up, and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%.You’d go to South Carolina.We’re going to start winning again.I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.So just remember that.IT SAID, I PLEDGE.And some of the best legal minds in the world say "Trump is right."Q (Inaudible) itâ€™s not about your personality or your beliefs.You see it with so many people.General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.I mean, it’s just total control.Look, I’m self funding.You know, because you need somebody of great achievement.In other words, that deal is done; now we want to start all over again.You know, they never report it.At 46 percent, you have 15 people.Like Senator Dan Coates whose there â€” one of the most respected men of the Senate â€” he canâ€™t get approved.To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.We will have that money brought back in.OK?They’ve devalued the yen to such an extent – Japan – that it made it, I mean, I owe it to my family, to my company, to myself.From Dallas and Mobile and Oklahoma.The public has a right to know how these people got here.Iâ€™m dealing with Argentina.We need a new leader.I figured they were fixed for certain reasons.Are you eyeing a possible extension â€” 30 days, maybe 60 days?And again, it may have been the debate, which would have set records if I did it.Taken away.Then they said, "Well, he’ll never sign and he’ll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he’s not as rich as people think."I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA.Frankly, before the wall goes up, we might not even need the wall, but we’re building it anyway.I learned so much.Look, when you’re in war, you’ve got to fight and you fight hard.Weâ€™re doing record business.But you know, I really want to win Wisconsin because if we could win Wisconsin, we’re going to put all of this stupidity away.It’s a huge subject.And millions of people have been saved.USA!How stupid are our leaders?You know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct.He’s just doing this for fun.I am officially running...






... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.We have cities, we have inner cities...


We have poverty all over and this is how we’re spending billions of dollars.But you have to be able to lead.They didn’t want to report them because they thought it was profiling.Not a phony deal that’s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again.They don’t know how to bring it about.Look at the numbers.Youâ€™re going to have nobody.And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.We have great border patrol people.No nothing.These aren’t masterminds.But if you have a pass for two weeks and you overstay your bound, they have cops waiting for you.So I mean, much different than – you’re look at Marco Rubio – very, very weak on illegal immigration.Because I think of him as building in this country.On trade, Iâ€™ve kept my promise to the American people, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster.But we’ve devoted much more time here and South Carolina –






It’s not a question of learning.Itâ€™s time.I have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair.You look at other people in all fairness – senators, governors – they’re, you know, they’re way down.Incredible.He’s a good guy.And everybody wanted his endorsement and I’m very honored that he’s giving it to me and he’s going to give it to me on the stage.And if we need them, we can start them up immediately.NOW WE'RE LIKE A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.It got 10 feet higher.We’re going to bring our education local.We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.And I look at it last time with Romney and I didn’t do it and I probably should have because he let us down.…And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better.And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.From their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more – six, seven, eight days.In honor of you, I will, tomorrow, make a call to him.Well, you know, the amazing thing is that the politicians in this country live by a whole different standard when it comes to health care, when it comes to everything they have including what you just said about Social Security.Beautiful.But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart.So I’m very proud of you, this is an amazing night.Itâ€™s the most honest.You have a big problem with discipline?It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade.We don’t win at trade – China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country.They’d leave New York or Florida or someplace where the taxes are lower.Because Iâ€™ve been telling the people in Michigan.I really don’t.And then Bush – Jeb.Nobody ever called us."I’m going to do some myself.I’m leaving with a whole big gang of people.We have — I have great, great business people that want to be involved.And that’s it.SO KIND.I don’t want to do."Conservatives.So when he – and I actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him.We’re not going to be Hillary Clinton, and I watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again.We don’t.Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us.That’s all he’ll get.But every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly.You know why?We’re not going to be the stupid people anymore.But this isnâ€™t Donald Trump that divided a nation.Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away.Youâ€™ll see.Q Thank you.Q    â€” to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like Roy Moore, to Roger Ailes, to Bill Oâ€™Reilly, to Brett Kavanaugh.(Applause.)So you think of this.THE PRESIDENT:  I hope you benefited.Yes, please.Believe me.Elaine, you see that?Itâ€™s a disaster.I don’t think anything gets out.Some are.Okay?If you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal this weekend, Mitt Romney looks like a fool.We’ve got to close the deal.But they’re leaving.They can buy them.NUMBER ONE, HOSTAGES BEFORE WE UTTER THE FIRST WORD.In rebuilding America, we are also fully committed to developing our workforce.But you have $1.8 billion in cash.It's just not fair.Think about that, folks.We defend South Korea for essentially nothing.But I can tell you that I do respect them.In fact, Hillary Clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.We have no idea.Okay?THE PRESIDENT: Yes.THE PRESIDENT: Okay.We can be nice about it.So they end up being part-time workers and they don’t want to be part-time workers.I can only say that, what theyâ€™ve done to this man is incredible.I’ve seen numbers of 24%.Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong â€” at my suggestion â€” and I give Reince great credit for this â€” at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.BECAUSE WITHOUT BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.If you look at the numbers from yesterday, I got the highest number in history outside the one number – in the history of the primary.I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.We have a lot of foolish people.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.They can’t.Of course, today, we use Komatsus because they’re made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper.Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USS Cole.We’ll do great in New Jersey.And many, many people are calling that you wouldn’t even believe – the media, the press, they wouldn’t believe.So, I can't believe it myself.It has to make us safer as a nation.I love them.Weâ€™ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation â€” take a look at Chicago and others â€” taking place right now in our inner cities.No more nation building.We have the Club for Growth, which is forget them.But you know, you do pretty serious damage, right?The hedge fund and the Wall Street donors she slanders and smears with her statements last week.To those Americans who have lost loved ones: All of America is grieving with you, and our hearts are joined with yours forever.And that’s what’s going to happen.Thatâ€™s amazing.My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.They can buy them.I’m not angry with China.Remember the deal?They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.I have kids and grandkids.They got crushed.Q Just because of this â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?And you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, "Are you sure about that?And they get paid a lot of money – in many cases more than men doing the same job.Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion.I say "$250 million."I love the Hispanics.Campaign managers aren’t supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, except she never went to the ground.And many of the other groups were upset.I’ve been talking about this for two years.So when it comes to the business tax, we are dead last.And then they said, "And Donald Trump is winning."Folks, by the way, we’re going to build a wall and who’s going to pay for the wall?You’re going to watch him.So I filed my financials – almost 100 pages.Now, right after the program that we’re talking about — and I thought it was clear, but you know, we’re talking about groups, groups, groups.THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s actually amazing.Of the 93 many of these people want jobs.So it could be forever.And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.Now, one of the things – with that being said, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, these countries are all taking our jobs like we’re a bunch of babies.Believe me.Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.I would much rather spend time with you than any of the pundits, consultants, or special interests, certainly â€” or reporters from Washington, D.C.By putting our faith in the people, and by putting our trust in God, we will rise to this occasion like no one has ever risen before.Nobody said it.Has been very unfair.I took heat like nobody has ever taken heat.They went to this.Lots of Harleys.Thank you very much, everybody.They pulled back then they went in with fury.It took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know weâ€™re on the same wavelength.They’re young.And another great friend of mine, someone respected by everybody, a great friend of Phil too—Mr.I donâ€™t know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out.Am I nervous?Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.And...






And you’re going to remember this moment.Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.It’s not only Jeb Bush.Well, we love them.We need strength."But there are some people that don’t like him."And I have people that come from far — they are all here legally, don’t worry about it.We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world.We canâ€™t let that happen.It was on display, where we had this group of people, who — many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK?You know, when you have so many people running – we had 17 and then they started to drop.She came out with that — she came out — remember, she wrote — she said, "He’s got a — he’s demonstrated a penchant" — I demonstrated — "a penchant for sexism."Now, the debates used to be, if you go back four years or eight years, you know, whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted — they didn’t want the debates.And I have a lot of Cuban friends.When the United States grows, so does the world.Anyways, so we get him back and here’s the deal we made.I mean, we’re rebuilding Mexico.Thank you.We’re going to knock out ISIS.It’s one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way.Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today.Because any deal I make with China, if itâ€™s the great â€” itâ€™s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or Iâ€™m not going to have a deal.Q    About the hearing tomorrow.Yeah, most people.So either way, it wasnâ€™t very satisfactory to me.AND FRANKLY, THE ONLY REASON I COULD WIN IS WE WON IN SUCH LANDSLIDES ALL OVER THE PLACE, INCLUDING IN INDIANA."No, no.I won with men.Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.But most people aren’t and they believe something.But then when we left, we left the wrong way."I in a lot of money.And then they say "Trump goes bankrupt."And with that, Iâ€™d just say, God bless America, and letâ€™s take some questions.But I’d get along with these people.I think.It will be a real wall.I remember that.Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?She has all sorts of beautiful statements about it.WAS IT SOMETHING ELSE?We’ve been very disappointed.You better hope I’m President.Letâ€™s go.And Iâ€™ve been saying it, and Iâ€™ll say it openly â€” and some people like it and some people donâ€™t like it, and I donâ€™t really care.Those police are tough cookies.I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King.And I don’t want that to happen.Q You said you loved WikiLeaks.Not really a question of learning.After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and America â€” (applause) â€” America is again winning each and every day.It’s not moving.Not going to happen anymore.I believe that.Those are the bosses.A new optimism is sweeping our land.But they stop.We’re going to lower taxes.(Applause.)What happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture.And when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say "I’m sorry.So you know, Jeff Sessions is certainly somebody that I would consider.The more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense, because it is like a mandate.We say "we’re gonna protect."I went up to Youngstown.Thousands and thousands of people standing outside of an airplane hangar because the hangar was packed.These guys are the toughest — these are the greatest people.I mean, give me a break.It’s the weirdest deal I’ve ever seen.That’s really nice.We need safer communities, and weâ€™re going to do that with law enforcement.They’re worth billions of dollars.What kind of stuff is that?We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones.But I decided let’s do this.PEOPLE AND COUNTRIES TAKE OUR COMPANIES AND TAKE OUR JOBS, THERE ARE GOING TO BE CONSEQUENCES.We don’t.Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.Far worse now, itâ€™s a total catastrophe.I don’t know.They love me.You have to talk about it.ISIS is very tough.And I don’t want that.You saw the Quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll.Nobody else’s.Mara.A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.Q Real news, Mr. President.This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible.Weâ€™ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.So, again, you’re not going to support me even though you know I’m the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and I’ll be that.Or weâ€™re paying for a lot of their military?The other thing they say is for leadership, number one.And I started on June 16th and — in Trump Tower, the famous escalator ride.They worked — they gave them a party.In other words, foreign companies have more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.If you look at some of the groups, they’re given 20 cents, 40 cents on the dollar and they’re spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips.It’s a terrible, horrible, nasty picture.I go out and I campaign.You know, they get a very small percentage of the vote.Billions and billions of dollars.And I told him, I said, I know politically itâ€™s probably not good for me.You know, very – I’m rich so I have tapes all over.(Applause.)Don’t do it."Itâ€™s wrong.Start right here in New Hampshire.These are the people that represent – these people are incompetent.Now, when Obama left though, he shouldn’t have left the way he did.Very high.Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.And it’s almost like they answer me and they say, "We don’t know.And it was nasty.We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations.But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.You know â€” you were here.One of the broadcasters was saying, "Is there anger?"Not complicated.He’s one and it was in his own state.Just so you understand.We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.And we all are made by the same God.We talk about amendments.And I said, "I’d love having you and I think it’s terrific.And provided millions of our fellow citizens with the pride and dignity that comes with work.And then he goes, "$1 million."And I know maybe sometimes you havenâ€™t gotten the backing that youâ€™ve wanted, and youâ€™re going to get so much backing.Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America.If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.A lot of jobs.I saved his life, and then he goes Hillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump.See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.We have to rebuild our infrastructure.They wonâ€™t vote, no matter what we do, theyâ€™re not going to vote.My hair’s all screwed up, right?Q    I would echo Maggieâ€™s question.But when I approve it – I’ll tell you what, when I approve it, it’ll be a great deal for the United States.But he showed up this morning because he was upset.It’s a disaster.Thank you.I’m serious.I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester â€” (applause) â€” and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.A big difference.But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month.Ridiculous.Discipline in schools.A lot of people donâ€™t know it, but our countryâ€™s in trouble.We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.It â€” for 25 years and longer, it was not.So then no.I own a big chunk of that.Wouldn’t you love that?He’s one of the – biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn’t read it.And you know, people ask "How come Trump is doing so well?And I think theyâ€™re going to pay a big price.And she was the person of the year and I wasn’t.So remember that.I thought I’d talk a little bit and I want to take some questions.THE PRESIDENT:  This is the one that was nodding with every nice thing I said, so watch this question.What I am is a doer.No strategy.We’ll have to worry about that.And I turn on â€” and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field.And the people that say we create precedent â€” well, what do you have?Go ahead, give me the better of your two.We’re dying.Right?We’re not going to lose."That I can tell you.And this is going to phenomenal groups.I feel it’s very unfair.We have a real problem.You know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out.I mean, you know, they’re being very strong.I mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws.Obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well.And you know we used to talk silent majority?And people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators – I know the best negotiators in the world.Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One.I’ve been on that one too.Okay?It’ll be up all morning because they don’t like what’s happening.Look at this.Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years.I don’t want your money.But there are two sides to the country.He talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old Air Force one, an old Boeing 747, with the old engines and you know, spewing stuff.Everythingâ€™s always been â€” for 20 years, â€œOh, China is so great.(Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.THE PRESIDENT:  I donâ€™t like NAFTA.That’s the problem we have…Treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out.We have to – look, it’s harsh.That was it...
Because if we win Wisconsin, it’s going to be like over, pretty much over.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.I donâ€™t want to do anything thatâ€™s going to conflict with that.It’s not going to happen anymore, folks.She went to sleep, OK. She didnâ€™t do anything.You may not want anymore…And everyone stood up and said "No, no, no, we want to keep winning."We have totally surrendered.I mean, this guy was unbelievable.Itâ€™s jobs.Now, if you â€” theyâ€™ve actually admitted that theyâ€™re going after farmers.We love the deal you made with Iran.Theyâ€™re paying billions and billions.So I just want to thank everybody.Itâ€™s a beautiful â€” itâ€™s a beautiful piece of art.I don’t think we’re going to have to use it.Boy, oh boy.And they’re people that are used to giving donations and having control.Hopefully, if they’re going to do something it’s going to be nice.We have no choice.There was a VAT tax that Mexico got.I didn’t ask for it.(Applause.)That’s right.I’m not leaving Iowa.But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.â€œHeâ€™s not going to get one dollar.â€  Well, I got $1.4 billion.We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.USA!These are crimes.Believe me, New Yorkers are good.But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President thatâ€™s fighting for them; thatâ€™s not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; thatâ€™s not allowing the kind of abuse that we â€” I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA.Think of it.And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds.BUT THEY'LL SIGN A DOCUMENT, ALL RIGHT, IT IS CALLED A PLEDGE.The old expression, â€œto the victor belong the spoilsâ€ â€” you remember.We’re going to win.I could have settled it.Russia is a ruse.Second Amendment."Very few states have that.Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree â€” think of that; this much â€” Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.You know, I know you’re going to have some bad apples.…And by the way, some of the media’s terrific but most of it 70%, 75% is absolute dishonest, absolute scum.I said, â€œWhy arenâ€™t you reimbursing us for our costs?â€

And you know what?Nobody.I’ve done an amazing job.Thank you very much.And I understand that â€” U.S. Supreme Court.And I’d go around and I’d see the people of New Hampshire, and they tell me, "Mr. Trump, our biggest problem is heroin."But the fact is it could have been the debate.Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.No, I didn’t say that.The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.You know what the demands are.We’re going to bring the economy back.Some of these hospitals are dying.We’re sitting on a bubble.Right?And I do well with the evangelicals.I tell you.So the number isn’t reflective.I mean, who cares?As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.We don’t talk about age but she’s 92.He said, sir, they dropped the suit.I mean, think of it.So we don’t know what we’re doing.I just got here.WE'RE NOT CLOSING GITMO.GET UP.And by the way, guess who signed it?I LOVE YOU INDIANA.Not much.And importantly, she’s on tape saying how great it is.No one dollar can be wasted.I want to be excited.A lot.Japan sells us cars by the millions.We like people like that.MY DEFINITION OF "TRADE" IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE GREAT DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.I’m going to be America’s champion because you see this election isn’t about Republican or Democrat; it’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people and I mean the American people.So cute....So I changed a couple of weeks ago.Because you know, we have a noisy majority.So don’t tell me about Bob Dole.Weâ€™re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.I want to help them.Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast.No, no.They will pay for the wall.And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.So, we are going to do something that if I get elected – and again they said I’ll never run and now…One guy said – John McLaughlin – you ever watch the McLaughlin Report?Biden openly stated:  â€œI said, â€˜Iâ€™m telling you, youâ€™re not getting the billion dollarsâ€™â€¦I looked at them and said: â€˜Iâ€™m leaving in six hours.That’s the end of it.Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that’s going to lift it.They pulled back.What message do you think that â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didnâ€™t say that.I’m not going to hit him."By the way, they took the oil that I said take.I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.They died with us.We just had one in Georgia – 44%.But Don Rickles has a lot more talent.What do you think?There were so many cameras.They would have said no.[ APPLAUSE ] WE PRAY FOR THEIR FAMILIES.We need a cheerleader.They probably figured based on reading the press that Trump didn’t make, you know, didn’t raise this kind of money.Think of that.I could pick another Supreme Court judge â€” Justice.They’re not going to be able to do what we’re going to do on the border, including the wall.Right now.I said, "No, sir.Weâ€™ve set 84 records since my election â€” record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period.But I think I have 15 new friends.I know many of them.If we can’t take care of our veterans, we can’t take care of anyone.Jason, thank you for everything, Jason.He goes would you do me a favor?Now, they don’t even want her to testify.I have to do what’s right.Guys that study NATO and good people but they study NATO and they say, "I don’t believe it.THE PRESIDENT: Okay.Iâ€™m a deal guy.Q    Your remarks today, how do you think that will impact the racial, sort of conflict, today?When we had â€” in Saudi Arabia, we had one of the great conferences in history.You have a tough cookie here.(Applause.)(LAUGHTER)


 When you win it's beautiful and we're going to start -- we are going to start winning for our country.They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens.And by the way, I was right, they were wrong.I want to thank Barron for putting up with the fact that I never see him anymore.And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific â€” a great deal.I’d get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth.They went into the old post office checking everybody who walked their dog, are you hear illegally?The tax is so big.But think of it.I shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail.But it took on a whole new meaning, and the meaning was very simple.We need an intelligence gathering system second to none.Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.So here I am – great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success.In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam.We’re going to go to Florida, we’re going to spend so much time in Florida.Letâ€™s go and have some fun.I made robocalls for Mitt Romney.I’ve visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.We’re going to get jobs.I’m sorry.And you know, when you talk about energy, I’ll tell you one thing, everybody agrees – oh, do I have energy.We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.And you know what?Cars are pouring off into this country.It’s not going to happen.It’s abysmal.So weâ€™ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.Terrible?Make America great again.We protect South Korea.They’re talking about putting them in jail.They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won.The Republicans are working very, very hard.I didn’t get 30%.You know, let’s talk about for two seconds, let’s talk about the Iran deal.I don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run.But he stands up Bible high, puts it down and then he lies.ONCE WE WERE IN, I SAID WHEN WE GET OUT, IT'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER, BUT WHEN WE GET OUT, WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT SOME TROOPS THERE.Now, when Chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question.The Obama administration.That is so nice.You are national leaders, business titans, industry giants, and many of the brightest minds in many fields.Theyâ€™re all investing.In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS – they’re corrupt – they totally control Bush and Rubio and I won’t say Cruz because he’s been very nice to me.(Applause.)Iran is taking over Iraq.You know, all of my life, I’ve heard that if you’re a successful person, especially if you have very success – you’ve done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can’t run for president.The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers.That's it.He’s the one that did Bergdahl.You know, I went to caucus.Think of it.Not the worst things about me, but bad things.They’re going to have some demonstrations.I wonder why — I wonder why.THE PRESIDENT:  I brought it.Let me tell you something, folks.I don’t know.Carl Icahn – incredible guy.So we’re actually going to be opening and it’ll be great.Hard-working people.Small-business optimism is at an all-time high.And overall, it’s just been a very exciting process.It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important.We couldâ€™ve heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time.It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.I don’t want to talk about that.I’m going on vacation."The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating.For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.Very strong.I pay so much tax."Nuts, bolts, and washer – to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there.I said before.And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.I said, "What, you think it was the debate?"But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I’ve done.I’d say 100%.I like ABC a little bit more â€” not much.THE PRESIDENT: No, thatâ€™s how I won.I say what a great deal that is.(Laughter.)I canâ€™t believe it.Because I’m not taking any money.We can’t get it back in.Now, the Muslim community, so important.21% for the second.Now, he was approved, essentially, but theyâ€™re doing little political games with me.So they pulled back and they said, "Let’s get them out."Five?A lot of people.THE PRESIDENT:  So Iâ€™ve received two letters from Chairman Kim.Why didnâ€™t Hillary Clinton announce that, â€œIâ€™m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that itâ€™s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good jobâ€?They just shut off their camera.If a governor from a state didn’t want to have them, I don’t care what it says, you don’t have to have them...
We want to help them with safe zones.This one didn’t like me.And all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, it’s tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers.Oh, okay, you’re okay, you’re innocent.Theyâ€™re fake news.â€  And you know what?They received $100,000 in the mail.We have many problems in our country.Thank you.And now itâ€™s a fight for whoâ€™s going to give the most.IT WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS.Why do you put this guy on television?We would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all.You have corporate inversions.I think he’s a very nice person.And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing.So we’re 28.And if you look at your premiums, itâ€™s through the roof.Believe me.Incredible.I said, I’m just sitting there watching and I’m saying, man, that’s really stupid.Q I listened to you during the campaign â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?But I think this is an example.It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky.Factories close down all over the place.Thank you very much.I’m this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman.66-years-old.Mostly false, vicious, horrible.Now, again, maybe Iâ€™m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.Yes, I made a speech and during the speech I said, "Let’s raise a little money for the vets."They’ll be very happy about it.(Applause.)Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, theyâ€™re building plants all over the United States.Okay?It’s like a rocket.Have to get rid of ISIS.It’s amazing.But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he’s private and he’s probably not as successful as everybody thinks."They didn’t want to report them.She hasn’t seen anybody that really did it to her.IT WAS SO DISGUSTING.I said, who did he endorse?They should be doing.You don’t see that anymore.I think there’s 23 of them.This room negotiates so I want to re-negotiate – perhaps more than any room than I’ve ever spoken.They have 24 days for inspection period.Thank you very much.This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far.I said the other day to one of my people "What is the United State’s trade deficit with Mexico, Japan, and China?"Weâ€™d win with wars.Now I’m dealing in trillions.And many of those are far less important than having a border.It’s what I do and that’s what we need.The wall is going to cost $12 billion.I have the best business leaders and they all want to do it.This shooter and amazingly in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth.They put Hillary’s numbers.And I’ve witnessed what it’s done really firsthand.The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds â€” families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.We have nothing.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.It’s something that has maybe never happened and they’re saying it’s phenomenon.TRUMP: They are the worst.We’re going to protect your guns.So, think of it.And, they can do it well — better than anybody.I’ve got to find out what’s going on.You know, we’re doing really well and millions of votes ahead of Cruz.I have great respect for these people.Let us say ‘Merry Christmas’, Happy Holidays."It’s so horrible.I have to tell you, itâ€™s sort of interesting.We’re under-budget and ahead of schedule.When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before â€” for all Americans.You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly â€” who got paid.We want you to close the Super PAC.I mean, you watch television.Donâ€™t let it happen.â€  And I meant it, too.But you know, a lot of people, they’ll pick up the phone and they’ll hear different things and they’ll say, "Uh, no I’ll vote for – " and then they’d get in the booth and they say, "Trump is my man."Thank you very much everybody.The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.I’ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he’s got a right to be nasty.The audience is young.They’re like grand chess masters or grand – I mean these people are the greatest – the greatest in history.We’re bringing oil from Canada.We are going to protect our second amendment.And it’s great.I love John Wayne.THE PRESIDENT:  I canâ€™t tell you.Well, thank you very much everyone.You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs.But we’ll be helping you.They’re the worst.Right.Mr. Kurd.But you know what?Oh, I looked good, didn’t sound too good, but that is OK. You wonder if that is a good trait.It costs me $3.Itâ€™s a very good emergency that he signed.But much different.A man just interviewed me back there, great reporter.Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into a private hedge fund.Because look, I love the people.Jerry Falwell Jr., an unbelievable guy, and he has been with us and with us from the beginning, and I want to thank Jerry and his family.Thank you, South Carolina.Bomb.They got complacent.I don’t know.And immediately if you’re not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country.I love Mexico, I love China, I love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incomptent and don't know what they're doing.You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you donâ€™t talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.I’m friendly with like Republicans.And if he wins, they’ll have totally controlled — total control.So Obama wants to put in a Supreme Court judge.It’s going to be in Syria.Why is it unbelievable?Got them jobs.Youâ€™re seeing it happen right now.We are going to take the $400 billion a year that we’re losing with China, that’s going to be turned around."Are you doing nuclear weapons over there?"Which they are.I see these ads and they’re mostly wrong.It’s so astronomical that I don’t even believe them myself.We donâ€™t like their representative very much.And theyâ€™ll be much better deals.Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs.And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy anywhere in the world.It’s pure deception.The lieutenant governor of South Carolina.Cruz has not accomplished one thing.We have to do something about it.You know why?Highly re – "In another act of political magic…Trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative" – nobody wrote this by the way.THE PRESIDENT:  People donâ€™t like saying that.I love evangelicals, and I have to tell you pastor [Robert] Jeffress has been so incredible on television and elsewhere.We have some incredible people.Before we begin, Iâ€™d like to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana.We got nothing.You’re elected President.But great poll.On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition – what’s happening here is absolutely a disgrace.Thank goodness but I’ve never been a politician.Itâ€™s very simple.That’s what it is.Q Theyâ€™re pretty good right now, actually.So it’s a little tough.THE PRESIDENT:  I will do that in honor of a paper I once loved.And you know what?You look at Obamacare.(Applause.)And then weâ€™ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully weâ€™ll get a fair shake.They said, "No.Number one in his class at Yale.To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.They want to put the steel companies out of business.I’m a man that’s built a tremendous company with the best locations in real estate, the best everything.We’re going to pay the bill.She had a big impact on that prison population, and far beyond.Remember that.Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal.Because I don’t really care that much.Why aren’t you more forceful?"The TPP would be the death blow for American manufacturing.(Applause.)You don’t have time.Somewhere in America tonight, a child is born in poverty, looking up into the sky, and filling their heart with dreams â€” big, beautiful, bold dreams.You’ve got to read it.She just gives me a headache.And weâ€™ve had very little hurt from what Iâ€™ve done.I don’t get him…He’s literally at zero.But let me just explain something.The economy is what I do well.That’s what’s happening to our country, folks.Senator Warner took a call from a Russian.Although I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I’m friendly with all of them.We have a – you know, with all that’s going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer – a relatively small ship – over there, I don’t know if I’d want to be the captain of that ship right now.I mean, right now, they’re projected I guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states.Right?So ladies and gentlemen...Taking calls is easy.He's tough.Huge problem.Itâ€™s a lot of people.We are one people, with one destiny.We don’t have the support.ANY OF THE CARRIER FOLKS IN THIS ROOM?These are among the dumbest people that you’ll ever meet.They’re doing it because they want money put in their PACs.Now at some point some of these guys have to leave.Our politicians don’t know — they don’t know.And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be â€” well, we havenâ€™t even gotten there yet and itâ€™s kicked in.You canâ€™t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential.Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that do it.And what happened and I haven’t talked about this before but I’m seeing what’s going on.She’s back in New York.I already am as far as I’m concerned.Do you understand that?We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.And I would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted, to be honest with you.Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.We can lead it but let the Gulf States – they have so much money they don’t know what to do with it.It is interesting, I have thousands of people that work for me.I used to use the word incompetent, now I just call them stupid.I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack.We can’t be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn’t want to tell anybody.But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.If we weren’t there, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t be there.And the press called me.Dodd-Frank is a disaster, by the way.That’s it.Literally every day, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states.I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have many with us today, to join me in unleashing Americaâ€™s full potential.What it is, is a barrier.MR. SCHWAB:  I would like to acknowledge the strong presence of your Cabinet members

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.I mean, they’re like stupid.I used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together.We’re talking about a couple of months now for it to start.Should have been out a long time ago.Today, I am going to talk about how to Make America Wealthy Again.Come on.He was at 4% or 5%.And I think it will all culminate in November and we’re going to make America great.You know, they spread out."AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT.I love the disabled veterans and the veterans.We can’t be that.And we have nothing.We love the way things are working.I get it built.When I’m elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there’s a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.Now I hope itâ€™s going to be surgical â€” meaning go in and do â€” itâ€™s lengthy and everything else.Now I’m a politician, which I’d hate to tell you.Thank you.I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.And I said, "Why is it that you folks are pushed around so much?"We all know that.The middle class has been forgotten in our country.Against all evidence, and regardless of the truth, you and your deputies claimed that my campaign colluded with the Russiansâ€”a grave, malicious, and slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other.So we don’t pay any money.He said "We will have all troops out by a certain date."And in some cases, I hear in Ben’s case, I hear in other cases, they’re literally running.But it’s still going to be a certain number of subjects.And I’ll tell you what.We’re in the real world.35%, 45%, 55% up.I’m not a politician.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question:  What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?So good luck everybody.It’s supposed to be they come we go, back and forth.No?I think I believe it.Thank you.We have made them that way.Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando’s LGBT community.You know, we can be very tough.You have a bigger problem with China.With the money that we’re giving them, they’re going to take off and they’re going to get the oil, they’re going to get everything.They’re not coming in.Please don’t be insulted, Chuck.And one’s coming out – I guess a big one’s coming out.Itâ€™s being destroyed, our economic worth.So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education.He’s one and 32.They’ve taken our jobs.And you know, I feel – I fight.Blaine Luetkemeyer â€” whereâ€™s Blaine?41%.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.Everybody says I’m right.The only – you know, I’m a businessperson.No, I don’t want to do that.Okay?We promise we’re not building nuclear weapons."(Laughter.)I mean, my plane cost me some money, but I spent no ads.But I wouldn’t even waste my time with this one.So thatâ€™s, frankly, one of the things Iâ€™m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.Wouldn’t this be money better spent rebuilding America for our current population including the many poor people already living here.But that’s the way our people negotiate.Itâ€™s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.But I talk about it because I consider it very important.PLACES OUTSIDE OF THIS COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, DIFFERENT PLACES HAVE AIRPORTS THAT WE CAN ONLY DREAM ABOUT.I came in second.And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.I love this state.They need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts.She should have.Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.And then, here’s Bush.And the reason is bureaucracy.Stand up.Wouldn’t it be nice if they had a gun on their waist?Weâ€™ll take it, but these are the problems we have.Well, he [referring to Ted Cruz] insulted me.So Phil and Steve and families, we appreciate it.I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a record, Mike, that can ever be broken.It’s an economic behemoth.They love me, I love them.He stands up – and I win as you know, you’ve seen it.Finally, weâ€™re going to take care of our veterans.I like scrutiny.You know, we started off with that 17 number.And Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator.We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.People pushing left and right, left and right.The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer.(Laughter.)And now what’s happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States – two reasons – lower taxes but also to get their money.To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused.Everyone is toying with us right now.I get things done.As liberal law professor Jonathan Turley warned when addressing Congressional Democrats: â€œI canâ€™t emphasize this enoughâ€¦if you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power.There wonâ€™t be so many other things that have gone on.And I havenâ€™t even started.He was incredible.And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.But you know what I’ll be?Can you imagine that?And I have been writing letters to him for when I’m in heaven to tell him that what you’ve done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us.We gave them $150 billion.And by the way, what people don’t understand – the 24-day provision doesn’t start – you know this, right?Congratulations to Steve.He got away with murder.Now when you talk about the planet, it’s so big out there — we’re here, they’re there, it’s like they’re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe.They’re going to self-police – think about that one – they are going to go and self-police.(Applause.)Itâ€™s a very big thing to put it out.They’re not being taken care of.Look, these are very dishonest people.And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party.They’d all come to me, and I’d give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max – bing, bing, bing.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the FBI told us theyâ€™ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years.And Romney let us down.(Applause.)Are you ready?They devalue their currency.We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before.SO THE MESSAGE MUST BE DELIVERED CLEARLY FOR ALL TO HEAR, THE HOSTILITY AGAINST OUR POLICE HAS TO END, AND IT HAS TO END RIGHT NOW.Are the other Republicans afraid to debate?They use it.Let me tell you.The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest wage countries on Earth.I don’t know.I’m smiling.So we have – there’s a good bonding going on.At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were…but while it was an attack, at least it was military.But then I got to be, you know, started going around and I see the corruption with these Super PACs, with the stuff towards money.We have no choice.Q Did you fire him because (inaudible) â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me â€” no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.That’s an election that should have been won.EVER.Victory is not winning for our party.SPEECH 11: Remarks by President Trump at Tax Reform Event - Sept. 5, 2017

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.But – and I’m actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say "He’s not that conservative on trade because he doesn’t believe in free trade."Oh boy.But when you’re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you’re talking about immigration and you’re talking about the wall because we’re going to have a wall and we’re going to stop illegal immigration....I was on the cover of Time Magazine four or five weeks ago and Time Magazine was going to pick the Person of the Year.Effective unemployment rate 20%.Only.Itâ€™s an incredible country.He’ll never file."I mean, it was a tough interview but I thought he was very fair and I thought the piece was very good.They also didn’t mention that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton.Iâ€™m stuck with it.Just so you understand.We’re going to get rid of probably 85% of them.And by the way took him plenty time to do it.I say, â€œGee, weâ€™re not doing well.â€  I won both those states.Cole.AND THEN I WOULD HAVE LEFT AND HERE GO THE SANCTIONS.So you remember for about two weeks, I said, "Boy this is tougher than I thought running for President."(Applause.)And thatâ€™s part of it, too.I say it’s the noisy majority because it’s actually a noisy majority.Okay?Sometimes they say I’m a phenomenon.People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors.I remember that.And the primary reason is we have no victories.Q    Mr. President, you have another meeting tomorrow with Rod Rosenstein.Because those cameras stay right in your face and I think they can’t move.THE PRESIDENT: No, no, nobody that I know of....Also, I guess they had 185,000 people, which is 45,000 or 50,000 people more than they ever had.Whatâ€™s going to happen when Iâ€™m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?And we shouldn’t have given dates.Because they – thank you, they are not being taken care of.Weâ€™re talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.It was as though â€” I mean, the biggest thing thatâ€™s ever happened.Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.We have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct.We are going to reject Hillary Clinton’s politics of fear, futility, and incompetence.Remember that.In the Oval Office thereâ€™s a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King.Q Thatâ€™s a good line.Represented in this room are some of the remarkable citizens from all over the world.Even Nabisco – my Oreos – they’re taking Nabisco.Two ballrooms.I’m angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen.That’s called vision.I love Israel.Isn’t it amazing the way that stuff can work out?Maybe it isn’t.WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS AND FAIR DEALS AND GET ALONG GREAT WITH JAPAN.We have to rebuild our military.So with Japan, I said they got to – maybe we’ve got to walk.You have a lot of cameras here tonight.Remember the guy in Paris – the "mastermind".I don’t want to tell Putin what I’m thinking.They just killed him.When you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing.To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy.Remember, we have thousands of employees in Florida, all along Miami, Doral and Mar-A-Lago and so many other places.I don’t think — in all fairness, I think Ted’s going to have a very hard time.And we will make America great again.Q But do they damage the relationship?So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows.And we have a president that won’t even mention the term and you’re talking about numbers like this.Now people are saying, "You know, Trump is sort of right about that."I SAID IT FOR YEARS.But I said to the writer, "I don’t know what you’re talking about.Then they’d say well, they went to Ivy League college.They lobby Congress, they lobby state governments, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants, and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune.And you have much better protection.OK. No body likes Trump.I love it.We have no choice.I said it's not an honor; they're just smart.Wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s what I hear.This is not an option.Q    How long do you think it should take North Korea to denuclearize?It’s got to be fair.He spent $59 million.She didn’t – you know, if somebody grabbed you even one of the guys, even the bikers, if somebody grabs even a biker or punches you a little bit, you’re "Whoa!"If he’d like to play, that’s fine.Ted Cruz and Kasich are getting money from the banking industries, the energy industries.Weâ€™re very proud of that.And there are many of them.We sell the beef and it goes over there and it’s very perishable.And again, China likewise, I get along great with China.They have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway.Four: I’m going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers.Big massive story.So I said, "That’s OK." I’m proud of my net worth.These people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs....


...Well, I said right at the beginning.We’ve got nothing.These commissions are great Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes.Truly our President doesn’t know what he’s doing.You’re a real beauty.I’d destroy him.And he waits.Obama didn’t want to hurt the environment.I was in Tennessee four nights ago â€” theyâ€™ve lost half the state.The American people.And I donâ€™t have to do it for the election.He said – and this was serious and he’s a good man.YOU LEAVE THE MEETING.Because he said, I donâ€™t want to lose this guy.Now states across the country are following our lead.And now Yemenâ€™s a mess, but itâ€™s getting better.Israel needs more than just our support.She really has no choice, but she doesn’t want to.Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength.You see, I know about deal-making.And heâ€™s a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; itâ€™s the Justice Department.I love country music.Big.But Iâ€™d see six, seven, eight people for a certain position.And we're going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when China wants to come and negotiate, they're going to negotiate not with a political hack which is what they have now.How crazy are we?Once more we will have a government of, by and for the people.And you can call these people.Actually, I thought it was terrible.Education is the civil rights issue of our time.We will run this country properly.Won the poll recently in Nevada.One of the questions that was asked â€” I thought it was a very good question â€” was about the inner cities.Why aren’t they paying?Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, whoâ€™s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars.THE PRESS WOULD SAY, YOU SHOULD SPEND YOUR ENTIRE SPEECH TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND THE E-MAILS.Itâ€™s a beautiful thing.I will work to ensure that America remains the worldâ€™s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.She’s destroyed – I mean, she’s in the process of destroying Germany with the migration.Weâ€™re bringing our jobs back to this country big league.But they’re killing us economically.Weâ€™ve also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines â€” thousands and thousands of jobs â€” and put new â€œBuy Americanâ€ measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.That’s the good news.And there’s an unbelievable love of the country.I didn’t know.They’re with him all the time – the people that did it.Why can’t he just do that?I’ll tell you something…[interrupted by protester] said something to me the other day and what I really want to do – [interrupted by protester] – what we want to do or what I want to do is I want to be the people’s president.Okay?But in politics, it’s easy.We protect Germany.So I checked like, I don’t know, I think it’s 23.Six people were killed trying to get him back.But I believe I’m going to win.You see whatâ€™s happening.That’s a nice word.They said, â€œThat wasnâ€™t a very good concert, was it?â€

Letâ€™s go.Ayeyeye.Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.The utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations.Thank you very much.Q Isnâ€™t that important?We all bleed the same blood.Why aren’t they going to go and vote?If theyâ€™re a poor country and they needed protection, and people were going to die, Iâ€™m all for protecting them; I donâ€™t want 10 cents.THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.I think so.Because our country is in trouble.No way.We will win on trade.WE BUILD 95-STORY BUILDINGS WITH BATHROOMS.I’m very, very conservative on the military.Weâ€™re very well along the way with Mexico.Thank you very much, Alice.I have little doubt that they’re going to find anything.Now theyâ€™re all coming back.I killed the Applause.So we can’t let it happen anymore.A military island.We are going to make it strong.I build; it's what I do.One of the great hotels of the world."We’ll vote on Obamacare.You do a lot of work.They didnâ€™t know the time.Number two, we had a really good plan.Balance it out.We had such an amazing evening.But as you know, they’re playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so I think it will be very exciting.Number one in his class at West Point.Then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go "Oh, I made it, darling, I made it.The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period.Weâ€™re winning.Sarah Palin endorsed me.It always happens.People with us.Air Force One used to land and people would respect the people inside.I’m supposed to be, oh, isn’t life wonderful, OK?Could we loan you $4 billion"?That was the same person.So weâ€™re going to be very, very strong.They must do that.So I donâ€™t know about todayâ€™s person that came forward.A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now.Look at his plans on his Trump website.Now, Bush gave a very weak message.Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him.We just donâ€™t want testing.I have no doubt the American people will hold you and the Democrats fully responsible in the upcoming 2020 election....The bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore.We’re going to bring that spirit back.The greatest abuse of a country that I think I've ever seen financially -- China.I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border.I believe wages now â€” because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up.USA!I say so Chuck, report it like properly.We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.I mean, he — by the way, I met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got.I donâ€™t think I ever met him.Right?Maybe we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them, to be honest with you.When you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero’s, little kids want to be firefighters.I really do.Held high and then he starts to lie.And I said, "This time I’m going to do it myself.They do – you talk about a trade imbalance.What do you have to lose?We’re like a third world country.WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES.Nobodyâ€™s going to give me credit, but thatâ€™s okay.My great honor.I can this.Be careful of a bubble because what you’ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.I mean, is there a second?But with him...I always say, "Obama is the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen."We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States.They have the largest number of murders that theyâ€™ve ever had in their history â€” almost 40,000 murders.When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria â€” just two years ago.So whether it’s a matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this.Sets it up.They do great.(Applause.)In fact, in South Carolina, when we went to South Carolina, that was going to be Cruz’s territory.But they don’t show it.When I’m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state.But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.So they moved back.So we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it’s got to end.I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach â€” if possible â€” a political settlement in Afghanistan.They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they’re representing.But he asked me about NATO.And we’re going to stop bad, bad things from happening in this country.Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.So the wait’s now the longest in history and that’s the way we’re treating our greatest people and that’s not right and we’re going to change that.You know, I’m funding my own campaign.A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster.So why should Americans trust â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I was told â€” I was given that information.So whether it’s matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this.We won with highly educated.And let me tell you about the travel â€”

Q Were there any mistakes in that?But unlike you, and unlike â€” excuse me, unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.Oh, stand up.I would honestly say â€” because I interviewed great people for this job.It really is a tough thing to do.We’ll change that around.You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.I want you people to excite me for a change.What a group, great group  (Applause.)It’s horrible what’s going on.Look, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they’re at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out.They will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land.It’s not like something where they don’t get – like there’s big disputes and we understand that.I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay?And people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for Ben but for Ted Cruz.If I wasnâ€™t elected, youâ€™d be in war.But I said, "Don’t hit Iraq," because you’re going to totally destabilize the Middle East.And then it started also by â€” our people that are standing right in this position, that are in the Oval Office â€” another way of saying it â€” allowed them to get away with murder.They’re devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn’t believe.As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.Thank you, honey.But we’ve got to start thinking.Q    If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.Steve Stivers â€” where is he?The person sitting right up here â€” â€œDonald Trump lost on the ban.â€  Yeah, I did.But we’ve got to make our country so strong.Thank you very much.Sort of â€” sort of â€”

Q    And, secondly â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.Another one.To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.Now itâ€™s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.Governor Bill Haslam.And maybe it’s rude, maybe it is not.We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination.I still have not been able to figure out why anybody would have signed that deal.I don’t want them in our jails.THE PRESIDENT: No, I didnâ€™t.But what I don’t want is when I raise millions of dollars have people say like this sleazy guy over here from ABC – he’s a sleaze in my book.Maybe he was already that way.I always have the biggest crowds.So, Second Amendment protected.Itâ€™s â€” basically, theyâ€™re saying, â€œWe donâ€™t have any barriers.She’ll come out and do an event and you don’t see her for another four days, three days, five days.That was another thing.Yes.And these other guys.I’m going to run for President."I’m not.And unfortunately, the vote was very late.We will make our cities safe again.Appreciate it.It’s a great honor.I’ll be honest with you.Now arrives the hour of action.You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.We’re going to make our economy much, much stronger.The general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, "No, he deserted.That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.We did it.You’ve never seen – I’ve never gone bankrupt.Sometimes they’ll go into the hometown of a guy they’re fighting and they’ll say, "You know, we’d never want to get a decision.The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.Favored.It’s war.And unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we’re being eaten alive.It’s — it’s unbelievable what’s happening.I said, "What?"I agree.Whoever heard of Caesar’s?And thatâ€™s okay.We will make America wealthy again.But weâ€™re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.And you know, I’d be happy with 42 if we had three, OK?I hope so.All of these people -- volunteers and they travel and they -- and I say, "what are you doing?"And we got back our hostages.I mean, with all of this because I knew it.But I didnâ€™t say that.You did a fantastic job.Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we’re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won’t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.They are absolutely killing us.They’re failing anyway.They can’t talk.But with the ethanol, really, he’s got to come a long way because he’s right now for the oil.But I would have done it exactly the same way because I raised, Scott, we raised in one hour, I raised $6 million for the vets.BUT MY FATHER WOULD SAY TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and they’re going to end Obamacare, which I’m going to do by the way – I’m ending, I’m terminating, it’s going to be repealed and replaced with something much better.Iâ€™ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane.I said, really, wow, I'm surprised.He knows.Theyâ€™re incredible people.But they used to it to try and marginalize.So this was very exciting tonight.But hopefully, I wonâ€™t have to do anything.Right?They donâ€™t want the things that I have.EVERYBODY WITH HIM KNEW HE LEFT BECAUSE HE WAS ALL WHACKED OUT AND A BELIEVER IN THEM, NOT US.And again, this isn’t bragging.You know, I’ve gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious.And my whole life, you know, I’ve said this before, my whole life as a business person is this.Well, walls work.WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.You know, they go to Washington – "We’re going to stop Obamacare.We’re going to find ourselves a Patton…But we’re going to find a Patton and we’re going to find a MacArthur.So I announced — and I was talking about trade, I was talking about the wall, I was talking about the borders, I was talking about Obamacare, I was talking about the 2nd Amendment will be saved, by the way.They will never make America great again.If the prosecutor is not fired, youâ€™re not getting the money.â€™  Well, son of a bitch.That’s what’s happened.Nobody.And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.I have nothing to do with Russia.Cruz was second in the 20s, mid-20s something.So Zeke â€” Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down.Why haven’t they done anything about it?But my poll numbers went up.I wrote ‘The Art of the Deal’.25% of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy – very highly respected group of people who I know actually.His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views, and they murdered plenty.But it is really very sad as to whatâ€™s going on throughout the world with terror.THE PRESIDENT:  They did the same thing with the Russia investigation.It’s a real establishment.Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK.But let’s just sort of leave it the way it is.We’re going to do great in New Jersey.It’s not easy.Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing--  You know they copied it.WE'RE WINNING WITH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.I’m talking about a van to get up there.I don’t care about rules, folks.THEY MADE SUCH FOOLS OUT OF US.And it was very much discredited, as you know.That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we’ve ever had in this country.They gave them a party.Itâ€™s very important to me.Did anybody see the tape?Yes.They don’t want to lose their pensions.In response, a strong security wall was put in place.WE'RE WINNING ON TRADE.Grown men that have been there for a long time.Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America â€” which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.I mean, take a look at South Carolina.Here we go, right?It’s an unbelievable deal.And the reason Iâ€™m a cheerleader is because itâ€™s easy â€” because I love our country and I think weâ€™re just doing really well.Then it went actually 42% in the Gravis poll and in Reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that.And we found that out very recently in our last election â€” a lot of pride.I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.You know, in the debate I was mentioned nine times, I mean everything.And by the way, you are so smart.It just shows you how important it is.Weâ€™re also working with allies and partners to destroy jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS, and very successfully so.(Applause.)I don’t know what the hell his problem is.Ford.But I know how to win; he doesn’t.I was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13.That’s amazing.25%, 51%.And that’s how people that don’t speak – and I’m not just talking about Spanish; I’m talking about from various parts of the world – that’s how they will become successful and do great.…I would say very simply I just want to be treated like everybody else.We’re a dumping ground.It’s the power.And weâ€™re not going to let that happen anymore.That’s peanuts by comparison.Look, he’s been perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States.For many decades, weâ€™ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry.And just before we break for a commercial, "We’ll be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott" and here’s the commercial and I said, "No!"We will face challenges.SO IMPORTANT.They love the owners, the stores and things.When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.It’s going to be phenomenal.And it's constant; it never ends.I’d love to.You’re talking about building the IRS even bigger and it’s a monster.He was telling me, that was not easy.I have been thanked by so many veterans’ groups throughout the United States.You did not recant.Same with Mexico.Their numbers are down.They’re all talk; they’re no action.This is a level of evil that we havenâ€™t seen.I’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration – moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country.I mean, weâ€™re probably 50 percent done.These are smart people.I call him the guy with the dirty hat, right?That is some group of people.This is beyond anybody’s expectations.The Bank of America building in San Francisco – I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows.He spent a lot of money.Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy â€” and I mean bloated â€” while protecting our national security.I could have you, or you, or you â€” anybody.Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you canâ€™t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.We havenâ€™t been given the walls.Q    Thank you very much.We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.And we’ve had so many instances – people that work for me just the other day – two years old, two and a half years old, a child – a beautiful child – went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.I keep saying two or three, it’s a lot more than that.It’s dying of its own weight.(Applause.)We’re going to have such great trade deals.We’re all like that.Our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know.Letâ€™s get that straight.He’s out there.But we did â€” we had such a tremendous, tremendous success.I got that through China through a very complex set of transactions but through China.Here’s something every single — I mean, almost everybody agrees.And I did him a favor and I called up the banks.But before I â€”

Q    (Inaudible.)But we don’t know....So the people will put three bullets in.The good ones.Or is March 1st the deadline?But Newt Gingrich said he’s never seen anything like this.We mourn, as one people, for our nation’s loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.(Laughter.)Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon.If a company wants to leave America, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences.They took a big plant away from Tennessee – a great state – they took it away at the last moment.It’s sad.Stand up.But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.Maybe youâ€™re going to say, please donâ€™t give us so much backing.And by the way, I’m not even saying that in a — that’s the kind of mindset, that’s the kind of thinking you need for this country.And it is hot in these rooms.Everybody agrees it should come back – Republicans, Democrats, everybody.BUT I DID IT, LIKE, I WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE AND I WANT PEOPLE TO REALIZE, I'M RAISING MONEY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE RNC.So, he asked me a question, question was fine.And you know why I wanted it — I wanted it, anyway, but I also knew that as soon as the hats came out, and other things — we have a website — as soon as the hats came out, I knew the press would be calling.NOT A BIG DEAL.There’ll be no problem."I was a world class businessman.And theyâ€™re going to vote.That’s all it is.I’m leading with Tea Party.We understand that.Donâ€™t feel guilty, John.It just doesn’t work.And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job.We have a president â€” and frankly Hillary â€” who donâ€™t use the words radical Islamic terrorism.Corey [Lewandowski].I see the last poll – the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I’m leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me.No matter who you are, we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we’re babies.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, let me â€” come on, letâ€™s go.I looked out, the field was â€” it looked like a million, million and a half people.Will we make a deal, Steve?You know what we have?The balance is so bad.Okay?And we’re going to be able to afford – you’ve been paying in it a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell.Doesn't cost me millions....We’re going to keep you free.Q    In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you wouldâ€™ve preferred that this be done.It’d be a horrible thing to get rid of.But her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said.Why hasn’t she done anything about it?And he was very successful guy.NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton.I may never see it again… Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that.And, I will tell you, I love my life....So it’s so important.Tremendous assets.And it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again I think we can even do better than that.We are keeping these promises, and many, many more.You don’t get a thank you letter.Thatâ€™s where a lot of the money has been spent â€” on renovation.I could hire a hundred poll.Can you believe it?She’s about to have a baby so I don’t know.So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words.They lose all of their courage and they’ve let us down.This is less than two years.I wasn’t looking for the credit.They have total control.I didn’t need to do this.I buy a lot of equipment from John Deere.And we are doing well in every way.They had no tractors.Remember it.We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.There’s anger out there at the job picture.But Obamacare kicks in in 2016....You know, I said bomb the oil, right?And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember.I think sheâ€™s fine.Tomorrow morning we'll be back but I just want to congratulate the other candidates.But I’m doing it because you know the expression and I see all the hats in the audience – Make America great again.WALLS DON'T HAVE BATHROOMS.Q    Mr. President, could you tell us â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  It should have â€” wait.Because the truth is that the Keystone Pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology, we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years, we have so much energy.They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now.That’s what politicians do.You know, everything’s so dramatic.Sounds okay to me.It’s a disgrace that we have.Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and weâ€™re not going to let it happen any longer.And everybody said, "Oh my, it’s much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers!"Burning the flag dancing?Absolutely.I wanted to say, "Walk."Now, she’s gotten millions of dollars.Iranâ€™s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash.And we’re getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love.Look, theyâ€™ve been frayed for a long time.(Applause.)Nobody wanted the debates.But if she loses she could have a very serious problem.I talk about Fourteenth Amendment.But America first does not mean America alone.But you know what?I will not say it because I don’t want to use anything that’s even a little bit off.Okay?On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America First again.Theyâ€™re so surprised â€” â€œoh, youâ€™re having strong borders.â€ Well, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.I’m a messenger to be honest.So I suggested frankly that I’m fine with him not being here because I don’t want anybody to think he’s endorsing.You are far from failing.So, he asked me a question, good.Have you noticed – and you’ve seen it yourself – the premiums have gone through the roof?And as you can see, I’ve given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets.$2 trillion.Our infrastructure is a disaster.Thank you very much.I BELIEVE IN OPEN BORDERS FOR TRADE AND FREE TRADE.Wow!First, we will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi.But many things I say are crude.I have 20,000 in Oklahoma, 35,000 in Mobile, Alabama.I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it’s a decision and they say, "Uh, we’re in a problem" and they’d lose the fight that they won.But it's going to be fantastic;
and so many other things.I just think – you know, I came up with the energy.Why are they knocking?But think of it.She did other things.And I just want to finish by â€” I have a group of people that have been so â€” I have a whole lot of them, so I wonâ€™t introduce because then Iâ€™ll insult at least half of them.I am doing very well.And, boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly.(Applause.)WE WOULDN'T BE NEGOTIATING BECAUSE OUR PRISONERS WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK YEARS AGO.(Applause.)It’s the worst deal.He’s getting the money from lobbyists and his donors.Theyâ€™re amazing people.You see what’s happening with the polls.Okay, folks?Well, it’s a good question and you can connect the dots.You look all over.And you know what?One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course.But I will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves.And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.It wasnâ€™t in the equation.I mean, it is true.Except the bad guys.It’s rich people.We gave them, by decapitating Iraq and then leaving, because frankly, once we did it we should have kept 20,00 troops or something, we give Iraq.And then you have a president that does an executive order.Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not.Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nationâ€™s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts Americaâ€™s interests first.This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States.I sell – I have one of the big leases with one of their big banks – with the biggest bank in the world actually from China.People don't over-say that.Putin.If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, â€œThey donâ€™t do this.â€  And he said it very clearly.They do it with so many different elements that our people don’t even know what’s happening.Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.It’s really easy.The time for trivial fights is behind us.We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William â€œRyanâ€ Owens.So people want to be protected, they want to feel safe.China is just taking advantage of us.But Iâ€™m not going to tell you.You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it’s virtually useless.It gives the states Medicaid flexibility.But they should have pushed it faster.Very sad.Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy.And if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest.Mexico is paying for it.There’s an unbelievable love.We will make America safe again.Actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming.It’s so embarrassing when you see what happens.Say a prayer for them.And maybe sheâ€™ll say â€” I could be convinced of anything.And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.I told you, I have no deals there.NOW HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of raising a family.5.4%.No, thanks.500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn’t respond.And they send stuff over here but we can’t send stuff over there.At least with me it’s not going to happen.No more rockets going up.And you know what?For 18 years they’ve been stagnant, they’ve even gone down.I think I’d maybe never leave!So weâ€™re really on our way.You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other.It is very tough, politically, to do it.WE MADE A POWER.It was approved by the Republicans.You know that.Why do we have to be shot at for the next year?And I said that Brexit's going to happen.I mean, our nation is in serious trouble.You know, Bush is only at 1% in Nevada.Itâ€™s a shame.It’s always nice to be beating the governor.I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton.And I wanted to thank you because through you and your organizations, my son who’s Mexican-American, seven-years-old, through your organization and just being able to stand on that stage with you back in 2005 the outpouring of love that can from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college.Have a good time.This is the hour when history is made.But thatâ€™s okay.â€  But a lot.Oh.It’s not going to happen to us again.And we all love it anyways.But having them in would be very good.Jeb – well, you know, Jeb’s got one problem.Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS.They’ve taken them like we’re a bunch of babies.If you’re going to do an ad, do an ad.Thank you everybody.Horrible.What difference?We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.It truly is a great honor.On November 8th, the American People voted for historic change â€” and they also voted for serious action.But we’ve had an incredible time.But Iâ€™m not happy with it.We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly.Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.In late 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City, and on Washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims.We believe that ordinary Americans know better than Washington how to spend their own money, and we want to help them take home as much of their money as possible and then spend it.(Applause.)You can call them the left â€” you just called them the left â€” that came violently attacking the other group.We can’t let it happen.(Applause.)He talks about competition.(Laughter.)Please.But it turns out probably was related – radical Islamic terrorism.They excavated — massive, massive — take a look, massive.It could even be before I'm finished but it's -- but she insisted on being here.How do you crack 50% when you have all these people running?And it will be a beautiful thing to watch.WE DON'T HAVE IT, I'M SORRY.So, as far as the other women are concerned, Iâ€™m going to see what happens tomorrow.Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our Gross Domestic Product.I’ve been saying it for years.Okay?It’s going to be dead.Let me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, they’re going to start to work again.$43 million for a gas station.And it was sort of interesting because I was watching the news a little while ago and one of the commentators, who I’m not particularly fond of but these are minor details, said "But Donald Trump doesn’t get over 50%" because I’m at 43%, 45%.SO I KNOW ABOUT THAT.WE LOVE YOU.They come in, they sell us cars by the millions.As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.Take me in for heaven’s sake.Believe me, you’re going to be in good shape when that happens.We know much more than the media for a change.They’ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete.And Hillary should have approved it.Now, I get along great with China.THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, you use anything they can.I built a great company and the reason – honestly worth billions and billions of dollars.And they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint.Thatâ€™s a big thing.And with Canada, weâ€™ll see what happens.You’re going to be so proud of your president.So I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent.Does anyone know?Q    Could you please answer it?There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to â€”

THE PRESIDENT: You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.I never thought I’d be a politician.My administration is embracing a new economic model.THE DISHONEST MEDIA IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS.Weâ€™re going into Washington.Okay?I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.She says I have a habit when you get a bill, you’d call up and you negotiate.We’re number 28 in the world.One of the problems – we don’t have enough jobs in this country.Thank you.Because I’m representing you.Because you want to win and you want to win fast and a lot of people don’t love you after you finish.Do I think it’s time to have some of the other Republican candidates drop out?I am a Christian.And I have to tell you.I knew it.I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasnâ€™t supposed to get one dollar â€” not one dollar.I donâ€™t want to get into â€”

Q    Weâ€™ve seen estimates of one year, two year â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Steve, I donâ€™t want to get into the time game.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, whoever is given a chance.Then they do something and I’m 10 points up.Letâ€™s hear it, NBC.And it’s been an amazing place to invest.No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.The court system has not made it easy for us.I’m not going to let Ford build a plant in Mexico if I can keep it in Michigan.It’s true.Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration.Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country.I watched all politicians and they say "I pay – "
I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.Hello.You know, they became — $150 billion — they became so rich.I like them.The time for small thinking is over.I’m in Washington."Oh.But you’d say to yourself why – you know, it’s a mindset.The CNN poll was 33% for Trump, 20% for Chris.And they interviewed a woman, I saw her last night on television sitting in a hotel room, which was not the most beautiful room I’ve ever been.Military.I wouldn’t.I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.No, no.The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular.So we are going to save your Social Security without cuts.I DON'T WANT THEIR SUPPORT.He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.The mainstream media – these people back here.We love all the deals.They do not like me.You have some bad people out there.But the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more.Thank you!Americans must know that we’re putting the American people first again on trade.We’re going to have a lot of events scheduled, yes.We have – we’ve done some awfully good work.Franklin Graham.(Applause.)I have millions and millions and millions of people.And I put out a statement that â€œyou better not do it.â€

And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didnâ€™t attack.Okay?He came out – I don’t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump...He was so incredible.Iâ€™m pleased to inform you: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy no Americans were harmed in last nightâ€™s attack by the Iranian regime.And we have the support of millions of patriotic moms and dads who go to work every day and make our country run.Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East, and it’s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.But I would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that I respected the decisions.This is inside, not outside.Oh, you didn’t know that.Our schools are failing.And we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better.And American ships will patrol the seas.I actually called.Products made with American hands, American labor, and American grit will once again be delivered throughout the world.I know one thing.…
By the way, Israel has given a lot…And a lot of people don’t know that.YOU'RE SUCH GREAT PEOPLE.America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder.He let us down.Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%.I was given that information.And the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up.North Korea â€” weâ€™ll take care of it, folks.And I gave, today, great credit to Iran.In fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent.I want to make a statement with knowledge.Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?When I was growing up, I always used to see the signs, and it was always stamped on the product: Made in the USA.I mean, we are losing so much.And weâ€™re going to make sure that trouble never comes.But weâ€™re starting to build them again.I made a lot of money.Itâ€™s a big job, and itâ€™s a job thatâ€™s not only housing, itâ€™s mind and spirit, right, Ben?We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because they’re Christian and for other reasons.And I was not happy with the way that information was given.I said, "All right.It’s hard for me to turn down money because that’s what I’ve done in my whole life.Now, the same thing a few days ago in California.Unemployment through the roof.But no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible.We’re not screening people.We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own.You know.Remember, Univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of Hillary Clinton’s biggest backers.Now, I will say this.You know why I don’t like it?To the best of my knowledge, there’s a lot of oil in Texas.And I respect that to a certain extent.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.Q    Okay, but youâ€™re not â€” you were pointing to me, so you meant me.Thatâ€™s not â€” this is going to be not good.THE PRESIDENT:  Amazing.The Tea Party and you can call it anything that you want.And a lot of people didn’t know that.So I think that they’re going to have to make that determination.It’s like — you know.Okay.Itâ€™s time.I wouldn’t do it at all.But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free.Theyâ€™re living in hell.The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape.That came out yesterday.That is very nice.Tough cookie.I donâ€™t like watching fake news.Some of it written by our opponents.Oh, they’ll kill me if I’m wrong.They must also be good to us.THEY WRITE AND SAY THINGS THAT ARE DISGRACEFUL.They have to start paying.We protect Germany.But Iâ€™ll let you do it after he does it.WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT.Q    Mr. President.That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies.If you’re a hardworking guy with a great farm or you’re a hardworking developer or businessman you can’t borrow money.Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be.And you can’t solve the problem if you don’t talk about it.In fact, I feel a little bit foolish.But heâ€™s a great man and I think heâ€™ll be a great, great justice.We had hundreds of bidders.I mean, it’s — can you imagine we are ranked number 28 and we are number 1?I feel it’s a very unfair situation.We need that thinking.Absolutely destroyed.(Applause.)I’d rather take a million and throw it all over this room.Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.And I think they’re right because he wasn’t born on our soil.HOW ABOUT YEMEN.In the meantime, Iâ€™ve built a lot of wall.People don’t realize.WE HAVE CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, AS CROOKED AS YOU GET.They didnâ€™t.In San Bernardino, as an example, people who knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.And I will tell you they probably had no choice.THE POLICE ARE NOT JUST PART OF OUR SOCIETY.This is not so easy.And you know what?And I appreciate it.Huge problem – she can’t.Itâ€™s always been a general or a politician.I don’t want it."Did anyone know that?We’re not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there’s still there and we don’t even ask for them.Who cares?There’s no paperwork.But weâ€™re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.As you know, Ford is building $2.5 billion factory in Mexico.Now, I must say, I know many of the Democrats.Now with Cuba, with Cuba we land in Cuba and thereâ€™s no Castro to greet him.The mother didn’t notice anything wrong.At least 51.Mostly false.And then what happens?He says, "No, no, you’re going to win.Only a few people got that one; that’s okay.But Iâ€™ve known people for a long time.We go to Dallas.Weâ€™re going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others.And I watched the next door neighbor saying, "Oh, well we didn’t report them because we didn’t want to racially profile or we didn’t want to profile."From Iowa.And I said, "Wait a minute.I said, "No" so I filed it ahead of schedule.Because itâ€™s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.I said, "Oh, that’s horrible."You’re in the White House.They have signs on their forehead.And he tells me a little bit about Club for Growth and I’m falling asleep.You go there, they have bridges all over the – they have bridges like the George Washington Bridge.The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly.And weâ€™re going to terminate Common Core.We protect everybody.We want to have heart.Incomes will rise.But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC.Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past.They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall.Now itâ€™s going the other way.I would call up the head of Ford, who I know."No!"They don’t know what they’re doing."THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.It’s pretty common with endorsements.I would have said, "Bye-bye," and I would have left.The last thing we need is another Bush.And, you know, we’ve been a little bit — we had to respond to Hillary.And somebody said, "Well, there’s a rule and another rule."We cannot allow it to continue.It’s not — look, it’s not going to happen.Weâ€™re not talking about the balls, or weâ€™re not talking about even the speeches â€” although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday.AND THEY CAN BE BAD PROBLEMS.It’s going to be fabulous.And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message.I’ll tell you what.(Applause.)THEY DON'T NEED MONEY.I’ll do it.Fences are easy, believe me.Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.Is that because of the many allegations that youâ€™ve had made against you over the years?I learned a lot from South Carolina.But look at what happened to all the guys I hit.When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign.And this guy’s a real tough cookie.This poll is good.And they sent us in here with a very good feeling, right?Q    Thereâ€™s not as much violence as â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, really?We need pomp and circumstance.It was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.Good guy.So, we’re going to just keep it the way it is.So Obama’s talking about all of this with the global warming and the — a lot of it’s a hoax, it’s a hoax.I feel like Iâ€™m 30, 35, 39.You know, it’s supposed to be free trade.You’ve got to be able to win something.Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.They make all the television – other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit.We just had one from the Economist just came out – 53%.Come here.I’ve always heard that if you’re a very successful person, you can’t run for office, especially for president.Because I did good in the debate.He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets.Thank you.Before I got here, everybody in this room thought you were going to war.They’d rest.And new factories will come rushing back to our shores.Because every single thing – he’d say, "We would like to get this."The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that’s what we want.They knew it was going to happen.And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her.We protect Saudi Arabia.Jeb – he lacks the quality that you need.And the bottom line is this.And by the way, I’m a free trader.They wonâ€™t be paying that, but weâ€™ll have a fair deal.See, they’re all trying to catch up with me.Take a look at our federal prison population.They had a plan that was good.WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS.Call him amateur night.Q    â€” before the Judiciary Committee.And do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office?Iâ€™ve wanted to stop this for a long time.New York Times?SPEECH 3


A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem.In each of these actions, Iâ€™m keeping my promises to the American people.For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya.And we all are made by the same God.They gave us a tremendous send-off.WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY.Itâ€™s taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.The courts are not helping us, I have to be honest with you.Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa – great, great state – and in Iowa, Trump 33%.It will die in ’17 anyway.In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.Okay?So Club for Growth, they come up to my office.We can't do it.You know what number two was?They don't see me anymore.We’re going to do that.It turned out to be another benefit of having it.But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, "Let’s do it from the White House."But he never got the chance.They have no plan now."You know, honestly, I don’t think anybody can say.I hope to see you there.So they put together this.But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.We’re going to have strong military.You have Perry attacked me.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.Great honor.The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.So letâ€™s put â€” or at least try to put â€” the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.The first time in the history of the border patrol that theyâ€™ve endorsed any presidential candidate.Just say "Steve".It’s an incredible place but it’s a place that has problems.So we’re going to get things changed around.YOU KNOW, WE HAD A GREAT VICTORY HERE NOT SO LONG AGO.We’re going to make it great again.And you know, I think theyâ€™d be better served by approving and making sure that theyâ€™re happy and everybody is good.I mean, Brussels, you go there 20 years ago, 15 years ago it was incredible.We’re going to do very well in Ohio.THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, okay.She doesn’t understand trade.Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, we’re leading big.I have — but there’s no better word than stupid.They got him so good.Think of that.I DO WELL WITH COACHES.If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table.THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO BEAT ISIS.It’s a disaster.I’m going to create a lot of jobs.Thank you, Steve.Already, we’ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine.I’m in hotel and I look at the ads and Cruz makes up these ads.It’s going to be out.The New York Times did false reporting.You completely failed with the Mueller report because there was nothing to find, so you decided to take the next hoax that came along, the phone call with Ukraineâ€”even though it was a perfect call.You know, they say Donald Trump – my base is so strong.I wonder if the press would want to attend.That’s from God.Well, that could have been with the debate.We don’t get anything.Okay?People flow over.And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people, and not because they backed me in such large numbers, but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away.PEOPLE CAN'T RUN THEIR BUSINESSES.You just keep quiet and let them accomplish something.Throughout my whole life â€” somebody will explain someday why â€” but Iâ€™ve always gotten a lot.There is great anger.We're brining education to a local level.But what you’re going to do is you lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court, therefore you will have a group of people put on the Supreme Court where this country will never ever recover.But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that?But weâ€™re tailoring it now to the decision.You know, 100 years ago, I would have said "Let’s not go."It’s going to happen.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.We don’t know where they come from.He’s at zero, folks.This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.Right?This can go on forever.We went to Oklahoma recently twice -- 20,000 people, 20,000 people.(Applause.)20,000 fewer people in the labor force in Wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by 100,000.But you’ve got to lead these men.How long a trip is that?â€  â€œSeven hours.â€  â€œOh, great.â€  Weâ€™re flying these massive bombers and everything.General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth.This is a self-funded campaign.Weâ€™ve been fighting these wars for longer than any wars weâ€™ve ever fought.It’s going to happen.THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s great.For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.Give it to me.And I think that’s, frankly, going to be an easy race.Iâ€™m very proud of Ivanka.So he used basically the mechanicsâ€™ stairs.(Applause.)When are you going to Iowa?It’s gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.$125 million.I know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they’re going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires.First hour when the hats were announced, I get a call from the New York Times.So I do that not in a braggadocious way.I spend nothing.Talk."We have to help the people with the migration.Yeah, go ahead.But I said, you know, it doesnâ€™t make sense, that wonâ€™t happen.I have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are Hispanics who I’m doing great with.Unbelievable in Mexico.And if we could do it verbally —






— you know, if we could do it verbally that’s even better, right?The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn’t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere.Iâ€™ve taken historic action to eliminate unnecessary, job-killing regulations.I can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me.Just see.1 one with Hispanics.It’s great to be at Trump Tower.I love free trade.We have decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.So we’re going to change that and I told you we’re going to get it localized but we’re going to change that.I have so many.I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11.And he announced that we will not be paying for the wall.Do they have any problem?AND WHEN IT GETS THERE, THEY DON'T EVEN WANT IT.You know we’re hiring a lot of part-timers now...The numbers are totally phony.THAT IS WHERE WE'VE COME.We’re going to have the SEC, which is going to be I think amazing.Thatâ€™s the real problem.Weâ€™re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.To understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper.TRUMP: Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold — five fold in just one year.That is Hillary Clinton.It’s the most ridiculous thing.I’d love to finish first.AND I SAID, OH, I FEEL SO BADLY FOR THE GUY.You have to vet it.A problem that could be solved easily by China but they don’t want to solve it because they want to tweak us.Weâ€™re getting it done.And with Time Magazine, I said – Bill O’Reilly, who’s a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than Trump, he should have won.Q    â€” to the alt-right, and saying â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Senator McCain?I said, how could they keep selling it?Q If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.But you would think that everybody we’re all on the same basket that everybody every single person – [interrupted by protester]
…So you would think that if we could get together, we’d all be in the same boat.I have a governor.I think it was in South Carolina where we’re way up and Lindsey at 4% and he’s the Senator.They knew we were leaving even through Bush.THE PRESIDENT: Quiet, quiet, quiet.This is a wonderful day.He’s a phenomenal guy.In other words, once the phone call was made public, your whole plot blew up, but that didnâ€™t stop you from continuing....But we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great Second Amendment person.So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work — also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke — who's now at Purdue — when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened — almost has not happened in this whole country.Not for a long time.I haven’t – I never really got to read it to be honest.So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, letâ€™s make them non-obstructionists.The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.We’re leading...Nevada.I think it’s going to depend on what happens with Hillary Clinton.At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?I couldnâ€™t stand that guy for years.And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico â€” thatâ€™s United States, Mexico, Canada â€” thatâ€™s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.That’s no good.Iâ€™m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.Every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests.What are we?The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don’t make sense, and which are unfair are gone.Thatâ€™s the one thing.We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States.You saw the new poll from Iowa.AND I SAID, OH, HE'S DEAD.There are a lot of people saying that we’re going to do a lot better.We have the greatest business people in the world.He is a tough, smart competitor.We need our police.Theyâ€™re not going to beat me.Itâ€™s being rebuilt overnight.And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left.I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.And thatâ€™s what we have to do.You mentioned General Petraeus.It doesn’t make sense to bring it back.It’s now two-way.But what happens is they say "Well, he’ll never file form A."If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI.I said, "Okay, we’re in Paris.We had one before.I hope.As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States â€” which is what it does -â€“ the worldâ€™s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the worldâ€™s leading polluters.WITH ME, THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING REALLY HARD.Thank you, Maureen.He was playing with funny money.But we came very close to healthcare.Itâ€™s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.Great.We win.We believe in the Constitution more than anybody.SPEECH 9
 
(AUDIENCE MEMBERS SHOUTING)


 — let me just tell you — let me just tell you a little secret.I don’t think so.And they also wanted a great plan.What do we get?Itâ€™s a very tough situation for a woman, thereâ€™s no question about it.Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese government.And I said, "I agree."Now, we may have a court case but we’re going to win it.It’s a movement.THE GOVERNOR JUST SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN A ROOM LIKE THIS IN INDIANA WITH THIS MANY PEOPLE.And we’re getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons.It’s really about results.I REALLY MEAN IT.What does he do?Nobody loves it more than us, so just remember that.(Applause.)And that’s what our country needs.You get one.Well, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly it’s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws.I said, "No, you’re wrong.You leave.These are really strong people.I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve Americaâ€™s interests.It’s the same thing.Look, of all â€”

Q Iâ€™m just trying to find out your orientation to those â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute.We want to run it, because that sends a signal.And your Senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you.And that’s not the way it’s going to work anymore.Where is he?You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members â€” because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle â€” theyâ€™re all in.Think of this.And you know, you’re talking about Second Amendment because I was asking with Randy and a lot of people, I was talking to some of the people before, "What would you like me to focus on?"Saying about, â€œOh, you got to stop Trump.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.I saw his statement.AAA.I look forward to it.But the fact is, should have kept the oil.So horrible....Two weeks ago I started.I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative.Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible.WE HAVE TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS AGAIN.And it’s so important.That was like that story they wrote about the women and me â€” front page.Big league.I can settle that case.They had no guns.But their leaders are killing us on the border and they’re killing us on trade.After years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently.But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing.You go into these department stores.But I actually think we’re doing even better than the polls.That’s the easiest question of the night!Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.You can end it a lot faster than you think.That’s what going to happen.I have nothing to do with them.So what happened is really something special.Everybody.They are normal."Theyâ€™re great.I mean, I’d see them on television talking about – somebody named one "The Art of the Deal PAC".We had death, and destruction.Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years.I’ve employed tens of thousands of people.Q    â€” right, how have those â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.Under our deal, itâ€™s not going to happen anymore.So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started.But Miami is filled with hardworking, incredible Venezuelan people.And he wouldn’t do all of this."The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.We had a fantastic evening.Then they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty.Thank you very much.We’re all going to have a lot of fun.Biggest, greatest ships you’ve ever seen.We did it.So we have a lot of big news today.Weâ€™re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before.Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.I mean, he’s on television all the time and he doesn’t go up.And always so theatrical; Mr. Trump said this and that and this.This is a serious wall.Three: I’m going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers.Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think youâ€™re going to get some votes from the Democrats.You’ve got a guy outside...go do a Google search on his Facebook.Q    The neo-Nazis started this.Well, the number is $5.6 million and it’s going to possibly go above that because I believe some other people are coming in.Not necessarily – you know, I don’t know that we’re going to beat Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and China.Wow.And we don't have the best coming in.And to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left.We’re going to be one of the better ones.I’ll go through the process.Now they’re going militarily.And they’re very excited about it.Working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians and certainly enjoyed by her.They made their taxes lower â€” and far lower, in many cases, than ours â€” and jobs left our country.So I wrote this out.Thank you very much.We use political hacks, we use special interest people that really don’t care about the country, they care about their deals.Worst deal.Jobs will return.No, I think that really Marco is over-rated.But overall â€” I mean, the bottom line â€” somebody said, well, they couldnâ€™t have been that bad because here we are â€” weâ€™re President.This isn’t working out the way I thought."Iâ€™ve also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with American steel.This has been an amazing period in my life.And we can’t let these weak leaders diminish it.And these jobs and these things that Iâ€™m announcing would never have come here.Q    Mr. President, could I ask a question, since I am from the New York Times â€”

Q    Mr. President â€”

Q    â€” before this gentleman?Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years.I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.We’ve become close to a third world country.I think most of us like Churchill.I went down in to the lobby of Trump Tower, on the escalator with Melania.So what messages do you for young men of America?Q    You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his government â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s right.We don’t have victories any more.We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.Oh, you need Trump so badly though.I’m going to do great with Mexico, who’s killing us in trade and killing us also at the border.Usually thatâ€™s a bad thing, but this was a good thing.Thank you.And we’re one of the only countries where that takes place.We’re going to stop it cold, folks.Well, we’ll be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight, I think they have 4,000 or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people.It’s never below zero.A lot of us.Our jobs will both stay here in America and come back to America.He meant that as a compliment."Exactly.We need a genius like MacArthur.(Applause.)So hereâ€™s the statute â€” which they donâ€™t even want to quote when they overrule it.How stupid is that?Timothy has just had his 12th surgery, and he is going in for many more.Those doctors are going to be so wrong.Can you talk about that?But Ukraine is near Germany and all of these European countries.We’re going to say "Merry Christmas" again.And then we come down here and I said, "You know, I think we have an ever bigger lead over here."They stopped using them.And it was put here for the security of our country.Florida leading by a lot – 31%, 19%, 13%, and then all down in the dumps.I love doing it.They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.I think so.How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka?"And the problem we have now that we’ve never had to this extent is the power of weaponry.I could have told him that six months ago, nine months ago, long before it was signed.(Laughter.)I mean, were they looking.One hundred thirty people killed.Heâ€™s a respected man.But the best is where they have the right to self-inspect.And remember this, this is a six-year – you have a six year statute of limitations.But you know, at some point, how long are we going to do this?We leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving.Samsung.And we’re going to build a wall.He’s a good guy – a really good guy – and his staffers and hopefully they get better.These are special people and we got a little boost last week from a place we all remember -- New Hampshire.The bottom line is I am self-funding my campaign.10?Iâ€™d buy things that would fail â€“that would be failures â€” and Iâ€™d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then Iâ€™d turn them around and make them successful.Weâ€™ve learned a lot.You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims.Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share.AND INDIANA WAS THE STATE THAT PUT ME OVER THE TOP.So I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination.Jamiel, thank you.Theyâ€™re getting a lot of good things.THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™d do it the same way.So we were talking about that.I gave nothing.Our market is way up.Those are good jobs.I just see many, many untruthful things.When I heard that they caught these four people, I said, â€œWow.Incredible guy.I have a friend who’s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.Unbelievable people.Last week, Adam Scott won at the Trump National Doral.To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support.The guy asked me a question.You could have as many as four or five.And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.They’re moving their big plant from Chicago to Mexico.They said some of them.Good.We don’t know anything about that.And the people are so smart.I really, I thought the people in Iowa were fantastic...You know, obviously I was second.Iâ€™d appreciate it.Look, our laws are so corrupt.It’s the craziest thing.So when we started, I talked about trade.Fake news.…Well, yesterday, you might have seen me.Everybody.If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again.They will be gone very, very quickly.And by the way, that question — I hate those questions.We will someday in the not so distant future if I win – otherwise it’s not going to happen I have to be honest with you.But it’s true.What do — we get nothing.Millions of people.First and foremost, our tax system should benefit loyal, hardworking Americans and their families.Give me a break.We put it in.This is your celebration.Because the Hispanics that are here legally, those people they want me, they know I’m going to bring jobs and everything else.And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet.We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice.Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country â€” a horrible moment.But there’s not 6 million.They’ve taken our manufacturing all over the place.Our country is great.So, so important.Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country.We don’t want anything – and I told him.And his second problem is he’s very weak on illegal immigration.Anybody mind, please stand up.So we were talking about.But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning â€” a great learning center â€” with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.It’s unbelievable.He didn’t change his views.Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny.Let me finish the question, please.They said, "Let’s wait."He said, you know – did you see that?He is really a very good friend of mine.Who can complain about that?How many think they could have done it for less?And hopefully â€” and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help.Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in the USA.They wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that’s what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country.BUT WE HAD -- DURING THE SEASON, WE HAD SO MANY OF THEM THAT FOLLOWED US AROUND.I love you.And weâ€™ll take care of our steel workers.This is what — but they make the leaders of our country do things that they don’t even want to do because they’ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.Thatâ€™s correct.and 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S.And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders.$14 billion.But I don’t know.We want the country to set records, right?Weâ€™re going to keep going with that decision.WHEN OUR POLICE ARE ATTACKED, OUR ENTIRE NATION IS ATTACKED.We’re going to come back, come back to this area.Of course, what youâ€™re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.Seoul has 30 million people â€” 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border.Take a look – on me, he’s going to lose this state – I won in a landslide...I didn’t say everybody.I want to use hair spray.So the wounded warriors all over the place.So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non- endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK?Weâ€™re going to do a good job.They’ll probably if they actually raised money for me, they’ll say "What a horrible thing he just said."I take care of Kasich."He’s a clown.I think he is a nice guy.But I don’t know.And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they don’t want people coming in illegally.You don’t know the power that you have.And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit three percent.He borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have – a very low interest rate.These people -- look at all those cameras back there.She â€” anyway, she gets elected.They won’t accept it.They understood we have to do it.WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEIR MOTIVES ARE.Where have we had a victory in trade?There’s an example of something that you could do if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you’re doing because everybody wants to do it.We will defend our citizens and our borders.I can tell you.So many people in this area have told me regulations – regulatory climate – is the worst they’ve ever seen.If I win, if I lose, I didn’t need to do this.Q    What about the message thatâ€™s being sent to women who are watching?We want to give them a chance to speak.We have incompetent people.…Think of this, think of this, I don’t work for any of the lobbyists.Stand up.You got Chicago, the Chicago cops.And sheâ€™s a very, very strong advocate.And Fox — every two minutes it’s a commercial on Trump.We used to have victories, but we don’t have them.Walls work.She did really well.Today, thereâ€™s a level that nobody has seen before....Beyond even the fuel capacities, which we want to create as much as we can, tremendous numbers of jobs in Iowa.We’re going to have a strong border.But it’s $125 million.PERFECT.So the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, "Oh, you’re leaving in a year.We protect South Korea.We’re going to have some, I think I’m doing Fox and Friends tomorrow morning.I have the best lawyers and the best accountants and I fight.So they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, "Over here – boom.I could pick another one.We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.We don’t win anymore.America will be a tolerant and open society.Iâ€™m going to start watching.I mean, take a look at me.They really started us on our way.You are the ones interfering in Americaâ€™s elections.Thereâ€™s another Chicago thatâ€™s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.I thought seven years ago when Obama got elected, the one thing I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country.They’re being hit by the lobbyists and the special interests and they make a fortune.But you know, I love to tell the story where I have spent nothing and Bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that.Now, I must say, I didnâ€™t mind cancelling eight appointments.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Good, I would like to do that.Because this is what they do.Itâ€™s happened to me many times.Now, New Hampshire rated it their number one problem.I was in Los Angeles.We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on whatâ€™s going on in the world.He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted — who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy — but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump.He says, "No, when you knock them out, there’s no unfriendly decision."Some people think itâ€™s much more than that.But I win in a landslide.So we’re not going to let it happen and we’re going to get in there...So Saturday.I don’t know.And I had to say OK, that’s enough, that’s enough.I said, "No, no, I have to win."And America is crippled.Everyone else nothing.We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what’s happening.We don’t like him.Our troops have fought with unmatched valor.Pfizer.Mr. President, let me follow up on Jimâ€™s question that I donâ€™t think we got an answer to.If you don’t have smart people or if you have people like Ted Cruz that are totally controlled by the people that give him the money and they’re controlled by the establishment.I mean, there’s truth to it.They’d call and these vet groups they don’t get a lot of calls from the press.Youâ€™re changing history.We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border.I donâ€™t know.He was one of the three.Even this.So for four years, I have been talking about it.So true.Itâ€™s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.Nobody reported it.We’re going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.But I’d like to go in with a clean slate and just say let’s go, everybody’s even, we love everybody, and let’s see if we could do something.He doesn’t want to say, "Oh, give me $200,000 a year in government money."So it happened and it's very, very sad.They can buy it.It’s not just a national security issue....I’m a big Second Amendment person by the way.We either have a country or we don’t.(Laughter.)This was on election day.We will make America safe again.But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.We're taking care of our vets.We’re sending something else.You’re not going to be educated – your kids in Wisconsin are no longer going to be educated in Washington, D.C. by bureaucrats – many of whom – I can’t say all – but many of whom don’t care for your kids.So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.(Laughter.)Thatâ€™s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.And it’s no good.Weâ€™re doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities.They’re wealthy because they make good deals like me.Can you believe that?What kind of a race is that?They said, â€œWe never said that.You know, a couple of times I say "Well, that could be the end."THEY'RE OVER.Theyâ€™ve been destroyed by companies moving out, going into Mexico, firing everybody.There’s been no crowd like this.But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed.And they are â€” theyâ€™re great fighters.He wants to give give me probably close to $10 million.Governor Pence balanced the budget.I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it’s so important.Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.Everything is read.Q    Speaker Ryan.That’s some of the press was actually clapping.It’s going to end.AND WHEN IT WAS COMING TIME FOR THE WALL, I'LL NEVER FORGET, VICENTE FOX, ON ONE OF THE MAJOR NETWORKS, USED THE F-BOMB.There’s no "Hello.That’s been proven.And the biggest problem I have, you know, it relates to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and you’d see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans – they have student loans – and they’re going through nice colleges, they’re good students, they work hard, they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say, "Mr. Trump, we have no jobs.We’re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they’re working.But Kentucky also is having a tremendous problem, as you know and as youâ€™ve read, with Obamacare.We go all over.LOOK.Theyâ€™re coming home, the traders.You look for a job.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.I mean, the guy is one in 32.We have the smartest followers there are.And actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well – much better than the political press – they said "solely for one reason – it was Trump".You know, they’ve been doing them for a long time.The GSA is terrific.What do you think the chances are that they talk?I think we have a very good result yesterday.I win in a landslide.Trust me, Iâ€™m like a smart persona.Q    Yes, sir, but not from President of the United States.We have 20,000.I’m at 30%.We will make this country so great.AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT OUR WHOLE NATION GRIEVES AND MOURNS FOR THE LOSS OF FIVE HEROS IN DALLAS, LAW ENFORCEMENT.Believe me.Here’s the thing.Something happened to him in the last month.And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one.I'M NOT ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE.Theyâ€™re great, great patriots.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Iâ€™m just telling you, weâ€™re going to be discussing that situation.It can happen.And I was the elite.And they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight, including us.She’s being protected by the President.If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state youâ€™re down to practically no insurers.Thatâ€™s a long time.Look at that.I feel badly.Didn’t devote tremendous time to it.And yet without us they wouldn’t last for two weeks.MR. SAMET:  Thank you!I mean, these are the numbers.(Applause.)We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism.I will tell you they are very capable.Does everybody understand that?But we’re going to be back and forth very quickly.And it has to happen immediately.But then when I hear the other day that now this deal is done.It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.And it’s going to work.When I say "Mexico is going to pay," they all laugh.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We’re doing great.But every one of those has been passed.Caesar’s filed Chapter 11.He was coming into office, he looked at the information.He doesn’t hate us.But we were there.We were in different places up in New England recently and New Hampshire was amazing.Well, look, everything — we are going to have a wall.And soybeans are going up, and things are going up.You know the ambassador was riding in a jeep, one of our jeeps, of course, a military jeep, holding the Libyan flag and you know, freedom, freedom, freedom.We’ve got to straighten out our trade deals.What happens?This is going to be the place that’s really going to make it.I’m telling you she doesn’t.Q    Are you at all concerned at the message that has been sending â€” being sent to the women who are watching this when you use language like â€œcon jobâ€ in relation to allegations of sexual assault?He said, â€œWhy did the President give so much?â€  I didnâ€™t give anything.We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world, and today weâ€™re like a third-world country.Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.He loves the rifle stuff.No, I’m not a populist.SORRY.We love our military.One of the things that made me so happy – I’m a protestant.We’re going to win.You had people in that group.Now, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it’s happened now with two or three.We will end up getting healthcare.That’s all it is.Can I do that?Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then weâ€™re not going to make a deal.He’s an okay debater but he’s a bad talker.That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism not nation building.I don’t want to.You know, we’re leading in most of the poll.This Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster.What you’ve done is incredible."And in her speech, she just said they’re making less money.He was a comedian or something, but he said, â€œWe have pictures of President Trump.â€  â€œOh, where can I get them?â€  If we ever did that, it would be like a big deal.I want to know the facts.And remember this â€” remember this:  If we took, because thereâ€™s such divisiveness â€” and Iâ€™m not just talking now, with me.(Applause.)Do you know that?And by the way we love our police.You’ve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.We have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails.You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy.He hasn’t won anything and he’s not going to win very much.I think just about.We canâ€™t stop him.â€  That didnâ€™t work.During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?YOU'RE LIKE A BUSINESS PERSON, RIGHT, GOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from.I love every — you know what?Don’t you think?Q    Thank you, Mr. President.We’ll get it solved, one way or the other.THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO.I don’t know if you’ve been seeing what’s happening but Obamacare is a total disaster.We will bring back our wealth.We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.We have no victories.800,000 food stamp recipients.I have thousands of people that work for me right now that are Hispanic.The case should have been dropped.We have to bring unity.Thank you.Not that he wanted to."We think you’re making nuclear weapons here."They don’t go anywhere.We have an incompetent administration.Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization – moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas.I would say about 99.9 – is there anybody that doesn’t re-negotiate deals in this room?And we have to know about it.(Laughter.)We have a lot of private doctors that could do more business.But now weâ€™re down to business.The list of humiliations go on and on and on.And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel â€” much of it comes from China â€” at 25 percent.America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 – even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people.The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.I’m going to make America great again.The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change.They know it.He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn’t work out.One of them was small business now heâ€™s big business.You know, we fight â€” before I got here â€” we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we donâ€™t create a border for our own country.The Great Wall of China goes 18,000 miles.Unless, you know, trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if I get in.Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice.The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they werenâ€™t able to get it done.When I do my return, it will be much – my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous.That’s basically where you sign your life away.WE DIDN'T DO IT.Likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated.They’ve taken our jobs.I wanted to call him.(Applause.)So, no, that’s not true.SPEECH 4: Remarks by President Trump at the World Economic Forum - Jan. 26, 2018

Thank you, Klaus, very much.So, you know.This guy over here.The whole thing is wrong.Get over here, boom.AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.Iâ€™ve been dealing with the media all my life.We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful, remember that.And theyâ€™d come out and thereâ€™d be all sorts of hoopla.We protect Saudi Arabia.Some of the things Iâ€™m doing probably arenâ€™t popular, but theyâ€™re necessary for security and for other reasons.So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say ... now I was hitting him pretty hard.Think somebody got rich on that one?Would you like to leave and we’ll let them come in?Here’s how it would go: she would make a small token change, declare the pact fixed, and ram it through.They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars.So we need a whole new mindset.And then I see a few guys standing out there.Because I'm an outsider.Okay?I want to help people.We’ve been thinking about that now for a little while but Ivanka has been so helpful and Jared has been amazing and it’s been just great.We expect our partners â€” whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific â€” to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.It affects them.There is no second place because we’re so high, so much – you have China, you have Norway, you have Denmark, you have Sweden.She’s got a problem.Right?I live in Manhattan.Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia.I heard a couple of these candidates saying, "Well, they’re – " They’re such babies.So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.He called and spoke to, both ways â€” I think there were 30-some-odd countries.The media talks about "homegrown," terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.It’s going to all change because I’m not getting any money from all of these people.SON, TAKE IT NICE AND EASY.Well, Putin was interviewed and I was interviewed last night.There you go.Can't do it.MR. SCHWAB:  Thank you, Mr. President, for this inspiring speech.And these agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.So like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that.I didn’t know, I didn’t know, I didn’t know."Medicare – we’re saving it.They’re disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job.It only makes common sense.I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.He said he did not say it.But I didn’t do that — I took — I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth.It’s not like "Oh gee, we disagree on Obamacare.It’s one person.I don’t know.No, it doesn’t...You know, the government sort of approves different groups for a lot of reasons.Weâ€™re going to have a good time tonight.He’s getting better than me so I’m a little jealous.We're going to have an opening very soon.The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it.Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration.So I think those are two very bad points frankly.And companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which we’re going to lower by the way.SPEECH 13: President Trump on the Paris Climate Accord - June 1, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.It goes on and on.You know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that I — is very, very important to me; corporate inversion.Just many of you.America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave.AND OVER THE YEARS, I THINK I LEARNED THAT.Listen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win.They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.(Applause.)We donâ€™t need another massive multinational deal, by the way, that nobody on our side even reads, that ties us up and binds us down and doesnâ€™t even discuss monetary manipulation and devaluation, which is how China and all these countries are beating us so badly.I mean, if she hasn’t straightened it out by now, she’s not going to straighten it out in the next four years.I’m angry at our country and our leadership because it’s grossly incompetent and we’re going to change it around and we’re going to get the best and we’re going to get the finest.You’d have a lot of money left over.But she was Miss Wisconsin.Wouldnâ€™t mind it at all.What’s happened all over.And we could make a deal.The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.And I said to myself, if Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa?They represent truly the very best of America.And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.She is the worst.Itâ€™s in Charlottesville.I will fight for every neglected part of this nation.Another person sent me $12.Believe me, they don’t have it.You know, he’s a very emotional man.You welcomed that at one point.We didn’t talk about corporate inversions, which by the way, none of the other candidates, they don’t even know what it means.Well, I coined the phrase a few months ago.All of a sudden, the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out.I know the smartest.He wanted to give me millions of dollars.And my Trace – how good is Trace, okay?These historic accompliments [accomplishments] changed our strategic priorities.Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.So they’d come back; we get our prisoners.Heâ€™s outstanding in every way â€” academically.I beat Hillary in many polls.Q    So how do you â€” how long do you â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.We’ll go ahead.And you ought to tell your governor don’t let them move to South Carolina.And you had people â€” and Iâ€™m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists â€” because they should be condemned totally.How can you have 5.3% when you have 100 million people?(Applause.)"Mr. Trump, you have 30 seconds.Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history.They said, "Whoa!IT IS LIKE NASCAR DRIVERS.But if you think about that question.We are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, OK. We are only going to have that.They come right in."Thereâ€™s no way she can beat us because her people have no enthusiasm, whatsoever.He sent a couple of months ago, a few months ago, he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly, quietly sending them.They said oh, "We thought so but we didn’t want to use racial profiling."Because I do want to solve the problem.Thatâ€™s on top of spending billions and billions of dollars.Now they like the white one.He doesnâ€™t come from our country, but had a lot to do with it.We’re going to have growth that will be tremendous.It gave the Presidents the power.There were four women, and maybe more â€” I think the number is four or five.One hundred percent.Paris happened and Paris was a disaster.Itâ€™s true.I gave tremendous amounts of money away.And the farmers are going to do great.I don’t want the credit for it but I shouldn’t be lambasted.If I was killer-tough with President Putin, they would have said, â€œHe was too tough.â€  You canâ€™t win with these people, but you just keep going.I get along great with Mexico.I didn’t expect this.So easy.One of them – a friend of mine – said "I have more nurses working for me now more than before but I have more accountants" and the end result is a disaster; he’s getting out of the business.All right?It’s healthy.So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find.He’s a politician.Q    Then, what â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  They fought with us.Okay?So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine.They probably have the United States giving subsidies to move out of the country.I have a lot of money, and Iâ€™ve built a lot of wall.Okay?I won’t mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they don’t want to be thrown off the police force.Thank you very much.I mean, he’s his friend.Oh, this is going to be a bad question but thatâ€™s okay.He was always able to sink that putt.Itâ€™s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.It’s a disaster.She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience.So what do you think?Right?Yes?That's like very unusual.We don’t get it.Iâ€™ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil.And this is going to be a campaign like I think no other.Think about Boeing.THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO GIVE US -- NO, NO, WE WANT TO.I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China.But here’s the thing and I use it because it’s so incredible.So, one of the reasons it couldn’t get built is because they couldn’t get an approved environmental impact study.Right?It’s the only way I’m going to be able to get the crowd in.I’m going to be non-confrontational today for a change.So — because we’re not going to do anything.Thank you â€” youâ€™re beautiful.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thatâ€™s fake news.So here’s the story.They said, â€œYouâ€™re kidding, arenâ€™t you?â€  â€œNope.I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.WE DON'T WIN.Right?…The reason I tell you certain things and the reason I talk about what I’ve done and lots of good things.Thirty-six years, thereâ€™s no charge....So South Carolina just came out and that’s 32% for Trump, 18% for second, 11% for third.And those inner cities are going to see progress like they have probably, not probably.He’s not doing a great job.They see itâ€™s not fair.THE PRESIDENT: I have.We are leaving Iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time.But we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which we’re going to end.Now he’s getting out of the race.The time for empty talk is over.They wouldnâ€™t be there for two weeks if it wasnâ€™t for me, and the United States, and a much stronger armed forces than it was.But it’s very crude when you say you’re going to make our country rich again."Thatâ€™s great.[Audience response inaudible]...And that could have left â€” youâ€™re right next to China.Small Business Administrator â€” which, by the way, is a very large business, I will tell you that â€” Linda McMahon, a friend of mine.I employ now thousands and thousands of people.Okay?She said they’re being taken care of just fine.Every single one of them failed.We’ve got to do something because I’ll tell you what, it’s an incredible movement."Plus, we give Mexico billions and billions of dollars.And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.I’ve fought for my employees.He handed me a plaque because I supported him.I think itâ€™s great.This guy in his whole life didn’t know what the word establishment meant.They’ve taken our money.And weâ€™re going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.Thatâ€™s why I just signed a new executive order to dramatically reform the nationâ€™s badly broken infrastructure permitting process.He called me.If you look at both sides â€” I think thereâ€™s blame on both sides.I thought his interview – I though Charlie Rose did an excellent job.So, they don’t want eminent domain.You would say maybe two, maybe four?I said, â€œThis is the biggest story.Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program â€” the building of the Interstate Highway System.He takes a call from a Russian who turned out to be a faker.So I want to thank you very much.Hereâ€™s the thing.Los Angeles – I was there at the docks.I’m the one that had the tape.THESE WERE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.And I keep my campaign promises.You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.It's going to be over ...It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again.But I will say this.You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain.Yes.It’s graduated.They came just before I came into office.Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had.In fact, I tweeted "Is that all there is?"It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!Look!They don’t get it.The only problem we have is the size of the room – thousands of people outside trying to get in.But China is making them build a massive airline facility.And a couple of questions for you to follow up on some answers that I didnâ€™t quite hear from you, if you would allow me a couple of questions.And I give different examples.These American victims were ignored by the media.But it’s not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good.I mean, Iâ€™ll be honest, I just asked Japan.With the Republicans it’s less obvious.Oh, we’re going to bring them back.And here, we accept all of their products.THE PRESIDENT:  Sit down.THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.We’re not in the theater.These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.If you’re asking me who I prefer running against?No, they want – they say he’s a man – I’ve made a tremendous amount of money.CNN does a poll, probably spent millions, they never report their poll.You have been – I just want to say thank you.So I donâ€™t have to tell you â€”

Q There will be a response?They kill us.We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind.It’s everybody.Because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop?Q    What evidence do you have of that, sir?But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world â€” including bad stories about me.Well, some of them should be.What I did to that bank – ayeyeye.Thank you.It’s so out of control.Sharon is great.It’s one of the great scams of all time.Iâ€™m here following through on what I pledged to do.Weâ€™re working with the automobile industry who have been played around with.Q Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.No, no, no.I think it’s very dishonest what’s going on with our government.(Applause.)They never can come back.We want to win Iowa so bad.God bless you.We view this as war.I wouldn’t want to fight you.They all want me to support them.The relationship there, also, is very good.The platform went on to say:  â€œWe renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence and the foundation of American development and prosperity.â€

Now, these were some of our greatest leaders, some of whom were great businesspeople.But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.Zero dollars have been taken out for administration.Itâ€™s made outside of our country.To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are here with you every single step of the way.Worst contract I’ve ever seen drawn.He said, no good.To be honest, I inherited a mess â€” itâ€™s a mess â€” at home and abroad.But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq.A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse.Little Katie.(Applause.)And what happened is he was in a very bad accident.When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered â€” they loved her; they still love her â€” with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: â€œLast day of chemo.â€  (Applause.)I have a feeling she’s being protected by the Democrats because it just looks to me to be more serious than anybody that I’ve seen including Gen. Petraeus.You know, if I go into that whole mess of the convention, I’m not the establishment.You’re going to be proud of your president, and you’re going to be even prouder of your country, OK?And theyâ€™re given â€”

Q    Do you think all three should have a chance â€” all three should have a chance to speak?THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, good.Something about how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands....And by the way, Merry Christmas everybody.Of the $6 million – this was reported on the front page of the Los Angeles Times – one of the candidates who’s a nice person so I’m not going to mention the name.New York Times, come on.We love the Second Amendment folks.THAT IS GOING TO END.Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well.Merry Christmas.To keep criminals and terrorists the hell out of our country.They shouldn’t be talking.They have a tremendous problem.Does anyone know this?"I’m going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think that’s awfully tough to compete with.That way you’d work hard.I mean â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  People are going to have to make a decision.They’re leaving Chicago and they’re moving their big plant to Mexico.Because he loves Trump.I could be wrong.American Hero Adventures – $100,000.Soleimaniâ€™s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood.I build.The only way you can possibly win, take the hail Mary, they called it a hail Mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile.Those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don’t even know that but everybody is looking for them and that’s the way it is.It will be built.He did this.It ends the death tax.They want these things to happen.The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us.That deal is actually concluded.And I’m not knocking those countries.Ding.—


 We — we have had, no matter where we go — you know, it’s a movement, folks.They don’t want to leave.The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.And now people are saying, weâ€™re not going to go there anymore because we canâ€™t get in.Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, itâ€™s so great.But thereâ€™s a tremendous spirit in the United States.The other thing is, Iâ€™ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media.We're going to change things around.I really think we’re going to do great there.Q Thank you, Mr. President.It’s not even going to be hard.SO THEY KNEW HE LEFT.We must protect the lives of our people.BUT WE WON'T LET THEM JUST TAKE OUR COMPANIES OUT AND FIRE EVERYBODY.I got it done under a year.MR. STIVERS:   Thanks, everybody.Well, I’m meeting with Lorne Michaels in a little while.I don’t want to waste money.So we go down on the escalator.We either have a country or we don’t.Thank you, everybody.Iâ€™m ready to do my part â€” itâ€™s the only time I can see him.Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on Americaâ€™s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.And that’s the way it’s going to be, and I can see that happening because more and more people are calling, they want to get on board.You’re going to be very happy.We sell them beef.But that’s OK.I do the building and then do the rendering.But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, â€œOh, it shouldâ€™ve been better.So fortunately, I have a taping system.He did great.My wife just called and Ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she’s a special person and it’s going to be great and we look forward to that.I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.Anything is possible if we stand together, united and strong.Everybody says great, great, great.We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great.And Iâ€™m paying them a lot of money.They’re building up their military to a point that is very scary.Got to get along with everybody.This guy with the hat, with the lousy head of hair, but he’s a strong-looking guy right here.we can’t let this continue.And if you reported it accurately, you would say.Autism has become an epidemic.They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love.Tell him to go."We don’t want that ever happen to us again.We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries.And you could get them to stop just by saying "We’re not doing business with you anymore."Don't worry.They are doing studies on Donald Trump.(Applause.)Right?Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer.President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it’s precisely the opposite that happened.One thing – one of the groups, it was actually CNN.Putin comes out, he said, Donald Trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack.And they wanted to know whether or not Iâ€™d like it back.And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.They’re leaving our country.And I think if I would have said it about Christians, I think I would have had less opposition.And I just had such an incredible experience.I got it in the Obama administration.(Applause.)Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF WE CAN DO THAT, AND WE HAVE TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SO GREAT FOR OUR COUNTRY.…Well, I just want to tell you about Nashville.I like that.Not good for us.Heâ€™s right here.We want to do it right from here and from here and from here.Terrible.Who does Mr. Trump think he is?Big tax.You notice how nice they are after you’ve defeated them?AND THE CARS ARE POURING JUST LIKE -- I MEAN, NASCAR.Something happened.Because you take a baby in – and I’ve seen it and I’ve seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount.A SMART GUY AND TOUGH.We just can’t let it happen.Weâ€™re going to come back so strong.The power.And if it doesn’t, that’s okay too because you know I’m here to do one thing – the theme – make America great again.The lottery system is a disaster.Big difference.Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.I’m so embarrassed by that term.And if they had protection, if they had guns on the other side, with the bullets flying the other direction, it wouldâ€™ve been a whole different story.So we’re going to create a whole new system.So I put together this statement, and the only reason I’m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we’re at $8 trillion now.I mean, the leaks are real.I’m the real deal.(Applause.)If there were guns on the other side, just a few of them, number one, probably if they knew, they wouldnâ€™t have attacked.I’m building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and it’s going to be incredible.Steve, are you there?Now is time for a new Republican administration, working with our Republican Congress, to pass the next great infrastructure bill.Now, Sheriff Joe [Arpaio] from Arizona.I figured I’ll walk around maybe they’ll get the crowd.Here’s the story folks.No, they didn’t mention that.You know, you had 17 people and I was second.Remember the old days?I mean, he said some terrible things about – how do you get things done when you’re calling Mitch McConnell bad names.But now I like everybody.We don’t even get our prisoners back.It’s going to be repealed and replaced.I believe in free trade.You know, we had an interesting thing today.and this guy stands up and starts screaming.This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty, something we are going to do.So we’re going to build a wall.If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.America’s “job creation deficit” due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs – and that’s just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages.He refused to walk.We’re going to be meeting with a lot of people and I think we’re going to do very well.Thank you very much.I know words, I had the best words.Q    (Inaudible.)Look at yourself and others.Youâ€™ve got a good person.You saw it in Paris.They go into Libya.You know, it’s not supposed to be that way.(Applause.)Most of them didn’t go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they’re brilliant.And Jared [Kushner], married to my daughter Ivanka.SPEECH 12: Remarks by President Trump on Infrastructure, Charlottesville - Aug. 15, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.But 20 percent of them are wonderful.You know, it’s coming up.Thatâ€™s all.You know, you ever see he goes sentence after sentence and then he stops for like three, four seconds.They’re bombing.You see the great migration.Right?This Is How We Are Going To Make America Great Again – For All Americans.Right.You know, we talk about the new bill.One of... I’ll be criticized.The amount of money weâ€™re talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion.He actually has nuclear weapons, right?So we won the evangelicals.But I came in second.Isn’t it amazing?We have nothing.He’s a nice baseball player.Theyâ€™re growing faster than anyone else thought possible.If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice.Q    (Inaudible) both sides, sir.And I had no idea.Victory is winning for our country.And today â€” a very appropriate day that this should happen â€” we just announced that we hit three percent in GDP.Uh oh.He didn’t win anything.As you know very well, this impeachment drive has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the totally appropriate conversation I had with its new president.Her plan is to disarm law abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.His ideas are so bad.They left a couple of hours difference.I think.After I’m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies.Actually Jose Reyes is a baseball player.THE PRESIDENT:  Those people â€” all of those people â€“excuse me, Iâ€™ve condemned neo-Nazis.Not going to let it happen.Do you agree with me?Trust me.We have to see what’s happening because something is happening in there.THANK YOU, FOLKS.I said, "100 percent."Like Perry.And yet, you go to a meeting in New Hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine.Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn â€” there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY'LL SAY, DONALD TRUMP HAD A BAD WEEK BECAUSE HE SAID SOMETHING PERFECT.Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost.We owe now $19 trillion.THEY'RE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.THOSE PEOPLE HAVE FOLLOWED ME ALL OVER THE PLACE.And itâ€™s like, where do you go?We will make America the best place in the world to start a business, hire workers, and open a factory.And heâ€™s in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run â€” she lost â€” to run.And what are the Republican politicians doing about it?You canâ€™t walk down the street.That’s the Republican Governors Association.I spoke to him on the phone.Guns, guns, guns, right.He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.We donâ€™t have that too much anymore.With him, they killed him.Whatâ€™s happening with the United States?This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth.Perhaps most insulting of all is your false display of solemnity.They didn’t know the air-conditioner didn’t work.And that’s it.Iâ€™m campaigning in every community, every part of this country for every last vote.Then they’d fight, fight, fight for years and years and years.So I think we’re going to be more inclusive.(Applause.)(Applause.)We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.Department of Education, we are going to get rid of it.Why are they going to develop?Stand up, just for a second.I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.It should have never happened.Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenol young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian.I find it repulsive.All of these incredible places that I have.You canâ€™t do anything.I want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it.They’re building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.Obama is going to be out playing golf.But when I — when I started the journey, it was amazing.This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.They already are.At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw â€” the government forcing people to buy a governmentâ€“approved product.They have really taken advantage of the United States.Then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections.Maybe we’re not supposed to.So I think she’s going to be their nominee definitely.IRS, the e-mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost.See, it wasnâ€™t bad, was it?This is not a somber affair.We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.POLICY THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.THE PRESIDENT: No, I checked it.But all of this has gone out and I’ll give you the names.Don’t believe it.Q    Okay.We need General MacArthur.A lot of positive things are going on.I mean, probably they didn’t have a choice.We have to make our country great again.The problem is the good work doesn’t get shown on television.Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won’t convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women.If you’re a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right there…but if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can’t get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed.He did the right thing by vetting these groups there.The oppressed people of Venezuela, they are yearning to be free.Then how’s anybody going to beat Trump in all fairness?And I’m going to take care of our vets.We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but itâ€™s very hard to stop.I'm not saying leave 50-percent of the people out.How can you get people to vote for you?"I really fight back.Now, he finally gave up his citizenship to Canada like 16 months ago.I tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders Caterpillar.This is ridiculous.And I was accused by â€” I believe, it was â€” four women.But I will tell you, China is very special.I feel good with them.(Applause.)The Des Moines Register is the worst.Okay?They hit the last tune and everyone goes crazy.Don’t believe the 5.6."Dear Mr.It costs other people millions.I look good.(Applause.)SO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO CHERISH AND TAKE CARE OF OUR POLICE.We’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.And they were never brought up.Great nations do not fight endless wars.And all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag â€” believe me, we appreciate it very much.In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning.If you said that, they wouldn’t do it.We have ethanol.AND HE SAID, MR. TRUMP, I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW THAT I'M ENDORSING YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS STUFF THAN ANYBODY, YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS STUFF THAN PEOPLE DOING IT FOR 25 YEARS.Itâ€™s one of the favorite things in the â€” and we have some good ones.Think of it – $400 billion a year.I never met him, I don’t think.It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.He was here a little while ago.And just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars.Okay?Does that make sense to anybody?@RealDonaldTrump.WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.Same person.YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THEY TREAT CROOKED HILLARY, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS COMPARED TO THE WAY THEY TREAT OTHER PEOPLE, OR THE WAY THEY TREAT ME, THEY ARE SOME OF THE WORST HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH.And now I’m going to fight for you – the American people – like nobody has ever fought before.You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether it’s Carrier air conditioning, whether it’s Ford, whether it’s Eaton.Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded.They fight.(Applause.)I promise.You know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn’t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched.And it was on the Today Show, and it was on Morning Joe.So we take care of the world.Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small – and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future.Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it.Q    Was it terrorism, in your opinion, what happened?And again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions.America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer.They lose all of their courage.AND IT'S UNDER SIEGE.But you know what?In the meantime â€” and Iâ€™ve said it a thousand â€” I donâ€™t want to bore you: no rockets, no missiles, no nuclear tests â€” you know, for over a year, where you havenâ€™t seen.If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.And LeBron, good luck in the series because we’re going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that’s okay.He said, you've never seen anything like it.But I’ll tell you what, I have a great secret service.So the people can’t do jobs.So, I love you all.And it's not even close.But I really appreciate you being here.We’re going to make our country great again.He said, "No, no.He knew about it.Mexico was totally â€” I mean, they were great.Ask the car dealer in Florida.And I said, "Am I so bad?He did one deal.And I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest.I mean, they always write letters too.First of all, Univision is being sued like crazy; you wouldn’t believe it.It was a total lie.We all have tough deals, right?And then we had a case in Los Angeles where it was in California where the 14 young people were killed.Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.IT WAS SO HORRIBLE.â€œMy button is bigger than yoursâ€ and â€œmy button works.â€  Remember that?It’s like the other day – Ivanka, she’s doing so great.(Applause.)I want to thank Melania for that.I’m telling you, they don’t believe them.Excuse me just one second.But that’s going to be a lot less expensive than what’s going on.Well, one thing they are trying to do is they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump.And frankly, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising I donâ€™t have to because I do it the old fashioned way.As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been revived.I don’t think so.And what do you intend to do about them?TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS LONG PRISON.Japan, they send cars by the millions.You go to some of these inner city places, and itâ€™s so sad when you look at the crime.Go ahead, whatâ€™s next?That’s what they do.So, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life.I’m going to go kill people today but I’m going to put three bullets in."You know, when we first came out, we were all talking together.What do you think of Thomas Jefferson?Macy’s was unbelievably disloyal because of illegal immigration and they ended the shirts, ties.And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody.And then again CNN 33% to 20%.A friend of mine had it.It’s true.Energy is abundant and affordable.When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.So important – so important that the people of Indiana have been incredible.His pictures with Clinton.THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.They are fabulous people.Maryland – great place – 32% to 15% to 11% to 9% and then you know they sort of phase out.Number one by far.Do you believe that?You see him.You had the veteran – 65-year-old woman – a veteran raped, sodomized, and killed in Los Angeles by an illegal immigrant.Six people were killed looking for him.And in the meantime, in Michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place and they’re spending — think about a $2.5 billion — then they’re going to sell cars, trucks and parts into the United States, no tax, no nothing.We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announced.More per pupil -- second place doesn't even exist it's so different.I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources.Put up your hand.And Christianity is under siege.And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did.You know who Beada is, right?I said Bill Kristol is a loser and I’ll tell you why...He has called every single move.Thank you very much.BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CALL UP -- GOOD MAN.And your whole group, these are really special, amazing people.I think the public relations for Israel hasn’t been so great because Israel’s given a lot but hasn’t been given a lot of credit for what they’ve given…
In fact, some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in Israel.New Hampshire could not have been better.Bigger than any bank in this country by many times.They’re impressionable.I think he’d like me.A very good relationship.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.And to the congressmen and congresswomen, we very much appreciate you all being here.In a certain way, I’d say let it do now, don’t do it after I get in.Ever.We have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly.Immediately, she began radiation treatment.Do we agree?They ask for $1 million.All right.They’re being dumped and drowned in steel cages.They love it because their child went through the system.Jerry Falwell, Jr. Liberty University, I mean he is something.Laura has been great.Many are in this building.Now, youâ€™ve had a lot of Presidents that havenâ€™t taken that tact.I want the motor companies, as you would say, or the automobile companies to build their plants in the United States.Iâ€™m going to see.By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people.I always Obama would be a unifier.By the way, I won so many environmental awards shockingly.You know, the deal was five for one.And they’ve been treated so badly.Maybe weâ€™ll head into Miami actually.(Applause.)It’s not going to happen.I mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out.We’re losing thousands of people waiting on line.And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community.Can you believe it?It will grow rapidly.It's a big, fat, horrible lie.We’re going to have great victories for our country.See now I’m a politician.Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many--  Look, Obama, what did he do?He said, "Oh, I didn’t know I was a citizen of Canada also."And I say it all the time.We canâ€™t have that.I tell them "Pan the crowd", they never do.(Applause.)So I always preface it by saying I don’t consider that funding but I’m self-funding my campaign and I’m getting ready to put up millions, millions.All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.They went down.It’s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down.Very little debt.What is beautiful is when I was running against Jeb in New Hampshire.And they said, â€œNo, sir.And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that weâ€™ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S.  And I will tell you, this moved up very substantially.But he was all over the place yesterday.How stupid are we?Tell me, am I so bad?And we look forward to seeing you in America â€” special place â€” and where you are is a special place also.Itâ€™s a disaster.We will make our communities wealthy.But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago.Youâ€™re seeing it.Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form.I don’t think so.We have to make our country rich again.I came in second.I’ll tell you right now.REMEMBER THAT.But I would love your support but I don’t want your money.There is no moral equivalency.I don’t like that.We are going to make it powerful.But I think the people understand what we do.Weâ€™ll have it both ways.Our border agents are doing such incredible work.You’re going to say oh no, not again.The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and to protect patients with preexisting conditions.We’ve got to have heart, we’ve got to take care of people.Weâ€™ve already taken care of a lot of it.We have to take care of our vets.We’re going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off.But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.What a disaster.Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it.We don’t need the guys we have.So I have to say that we are going to turn it around.You’ll be fine.If something’s in your way and you’re building a highway, if you’re producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someone’s property, every once in a while.Jeb has spent now $77 million.A LOT OF THE OIL IS HAD BY ISIS.World class.But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest â€” because I donâ€™t know if you know, they had a permit.I buy a company – you know, it’s one company was sort of interesting.And you know the reason I bring him up – I wouldn’t even bring him up – but he spends a fortune on ads against me.We have to figure it out.She is so amazing.Now, as far as Hillary’s concerned, she’s going to go with what he wants.I like everybody I defeat.Give me a question.Again, the worst attack on our country in its history.WE WANT TO KEEP OUR SENATE.I’m getting these lousy early numbers and I’m saying, "I don’t know.– is that I had a recent poll and they did a beautiful – like these polls are great.You know, one of the great writers called me up and he said, "What you’ve done is incredible."It’ll probably be over that amount when it’s all said and done.It just came out.There are so many examples.It’s one second – it’s not like it takes place over – well, he’s going to do it 30 seconds from now.It is so unfair.It would be the electric chair, okay?That’s hard to turn down.I’ve been here many times.When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces "We are sending 50 soldiers."This is actually a tax reduction.Believe me, that will be the way it is.Q Well, thank you so much.BUT I HAVE TO SAY LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO REMAIN WITH US.Okay?I got here with no Cabinet.But I have to be fair trade.No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things.It will have the wall.You’ve got to be politically correct."It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy – mined from American resources – that powers this country.It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets – while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports.It’s true.She had a tough one.What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads.I love you all.I will do it.I don’t need money and I don’t want money.According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.Thank you.But it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great.I think they’re good for me.I will fix it.But they say "the young mastermind".But theyâ€™ll take this news conference â€” donâ€™t forget thatâ€™s the way I won.Does everybody know?It’s one of the great scams.THE PRESIDENT:  But Fox has treated me very nice â€” wherever Fox is, thank you.She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on phony campaign ads.If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans — women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now.I want to apologize.AND HILLARY CLINTON THROUGH HER INCOMPETENCE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY CREATED ISIS.These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.That’s the question I like.I don’t want Nabisco leaving for Mexico or any place else.So be very, very careful.That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.If we – look, we have to put these politicians in their place, folks.The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.So I know what it costs to operate these planes…More importantly, the time and the energy.You know, itâ€™s very interesting â€” I pick a lot of judges.You know, these politicians they don’t understand we have the cards.And many, many more.He goes unbelievable.And if we do that — and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known.And these are people that aren’t working for a paycheck.Because they let the president get away with absolute murder.If a country is taking advantage of us, weâ€™re not going to let that happen anymore.I was the one that predicted it.You know, I’m leaving for Israel in a very short period of time.Our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.I REALLY MEAN THIS.You know, they’re doing everything.Think of it.Him, him, him, so that when they — you know what they were doing in Paris?One of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing.People didn’t talk to me this way.Itâ€™s the same reason why she wonâ€™t take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world.She said, "Don’t play that game.With China, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year.And they’re telling you how to educate their kids.And I said, "This time, we’re going to do it ourselves.I have.So we get Bergdahl, a traitor, who five or six – probably six – people were killed going out to try and get him back.You’re certainly not very good.I really do.THE PRESIDENT: No, I didnâ€™t.We had another one yesterday, which was interesting.They’re going to have everything.China.So here’s the story.Remember, he said they come as an act of love.We’re going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before.I mean, that sounds small.We need protection in our country and that’s going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up.Okay?Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics – many from Mexico.I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I donâ€™t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick.Go ahead.I have known him for many years and we’ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region.A new poll came out today where we’re over 30%.It’s going to be down – I don’t think it even survives.We are creating an environment that attracts capital, invites investment, and rewards production.THE PRESIDENT: Who is that?And when you go, you wouldn’t believe it because it’s so bucolic, so beautiful.And Iran is a very special place.And a big, big part of what I’m doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness.But what happened is I won by 20 points – almost 20 points – and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues.Do you want to re-negotiate deals?Which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer, so they don’t get in trouble.The fuel.Before I make a statement, I need the facts.So why don’t we have an effective screening system?When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we’re in a bubble.We’ll find out how honest our country is, right?You’d think they’d say "Let’s do it.So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Remember?We have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 Minutes they don’t even work.Explain.They’re never going to mess with us.You see where I won Louisiana and then I find out that I’m not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that I beat.They’re taking so many of our companies.He further emphasized that it was a â€œgood phone call,â€ that â€œI donâ€™t feel pressure,â€ and explicitly stressed that â€œnobody pushed me.â€  The Ukrainian Foreign Minister stated very clearly:  â€œI have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance.â€  He also said there was â€œNo Pressure.â€   Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a supporter of Ukraine who met privately with President Zelensky, has said: â€œAt no time during this meetingâ€¦was there any mention by Zelensky or any Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to do anything in return for the military aid.â€  Many meetings have been held between representatives of Ukraine and our country.Or whatever.Weâ€™ll do it.Incredible people.No, weâ€™re on the right side.Gen. [David] Petraeus was given a life-changing sentence.We’re going to build a safe zone.This is not like maybe even about me.Iâ€™m approving the pipeline and theyâ€™re suing us for $14 billion, and Iâ€™ve already approved it, right?They’re right next to each other.There is only one way you treat that kind of behavior.What a good guy.Our countryâ€™s in trouble.And further than that, sir, youâ€™ve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.We’re doing well – I mean, you hear the numbers.Itâ€™s very important.It’s impossible to go on like this any longer.It was a rough – that was a rough campaign...THE PRESIDENT:  If theyâ€™re not going to solve the problem â€” and what youâ€™re doing is the right thing â€” then weâ€™re going to solve the problem for them because weâ€™re going to have to do something about Chicago.Thatâ€™s a very nice question.I was deeply moved.I’m not a rendering guy.1% is unacceptable.We can’t.That is a constant hit.I think it is number one, but why take a chance.And those industries are doing well.You have to come in and you have to talk to the people."(Laughter.)Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable.We have caught people doing things that are terrible.AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM TO PUT UP THE MONEY AND OTHERS.Q One more follow-up because â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Should I let him have a little bit more?They don’t know what to do about it.You showed no remorse, no capacity for self-reflection.And sometimes they’ll see the doctor and the doctor says, "I can’t see you now.I love the whole state.I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.






Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction.I believe in America.A soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in Guantanamo.Go ahead.You did too and it’s disgusting and it’s horrible.I came out, I started — I did it, I was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and Mexico and all of this stuff.One of the officials -- actually, one of the ex-officials from Mexico had a news conference.I’ve done very well in New Hampshire.We’re doing — they wouldn’t be there for two minutes if we weren’t protecting them.But you donâ€™t hear that so much anymore.I do like them.We actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 PACs.Thank you very much.And, you know, then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate.So if they could—they keep forgetting that when people drop out, we’re going to get a lot of votes.A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau.Mark is saying "What are the top threats to your candidacy?"I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things.Now you have all these people going because they said, "Oh man, Trump is terrible.It’s a sieve.And you know what?We have people that are selling this country down the drain.Everything is going wrong.I have nothing to do with Russia.They’re political hacks and these are the people that are negotiating with these people China.Thank you all.Trust me, they don’t want to run against Trump.And I have no doubt about it, and you donâ€™t have any doubt about it either.Explain.But actually I’m much richer and I put in my financials – it’s true.Going quickly to $21 trillion.I was invited.They’re right about that, but I’m doing it.I mean, a lot of good things will happen.Some are nice.It doesn’t make sense.Look, here’s the story.It’s just going to be an extension of Obama.Are we going to take down the statue?And I could cut it down way down.(Applause.)And then we have to read probably libelous stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false, I’m going to continue to attack the press.I know that four years ago, you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your frontrunner and he’s a good frontrunner, a good guy, and he did well but you had 400 people, 200 people.Once I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider.But Ted at least has a shot because at least he’s won a little bit.You don’t want to watch it."I have the greatest people in the world for dealing.Honestly, these are people — they think it’s funny.I'm making speeches all the time and I have a great.I was asking the Governor and Roy, I said, do you think I should announce them all?What happened is with Paris, there’s a different mindset.I made it the old-fashioned way.You understand that?I’m the only one.(Applause.)This is a big, big story.â€  He agreed with me.And I could say, "Oh, gee, if we came in the top four of five."Don’t you think they would’ve been better if they had?"It’s amazing.Theyâ€™re flying planes that are old.No, it’s incredible.But he wasn’t a cheerleader.They know it.WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.WE WANT TO BE STRONG.We have wounded warriors, who I love, all of.And they get together and they do wonderful programs.…But just take a look.OH, THAT BOBBY KNIGHT.All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.We lose with the military.I did not expect that.I would have made – poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy.And I’ve seen it where parents and all of these people – the uncles, the aunts – they’re all on the school boards.It is probably a much higher number.So the last person she wants to run against is me.And not good the way they took the money.And theyâ€™ll be two-way streets.…The question is should the Fed raise rates?There will be many, many more.We call them.Youâ€™ll see.I donâ€™t like whatâ€™s happening in Cuba, and I certainly donâ€™t like whatâ€™s happening in Venezuela.THE PRESIDENT:  I would say thatâ€™s up to a local town, community, or the federal government, depending on where it is located.I think it’s great.Thereâ€™s some bad players out there.SPEECH 2


Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation.They should disarm, right?Ever.But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs.They were supposed to come into the community.He can stop it.In fact, one person today said "Anything".That was a great vote yesterday.You don’t say those things."Yeah, it is.I’m totally in favor.We are going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful, nobody’s ever going to mess with us, folks.And now many of these candidates want to cut it.And, yes, together, we will make America great again.He’s just going to have fun.One of them is there because he’s a Christian.Okay.And those people donâ€™t believe whatâ€™s going on.I came into strong second.There’s probably no tougher deal.Beautiful bikes.Look--like him, dislike him--the 47% statement that he made, that's not going away.I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.I say that because that’s the kind of thinking we need, folks.My counsel came â€” Don McGahn, White House Counsel â€” and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself.If we go and win, Iowa’s staying right where it is in the chain.The next week, he said, â€œUh, heâ€™s incompetent.â€  I said, â€œWell, wait a minute.â€  In one case, Iâ€™m taking over the world.She responded to her friends.Nobody even heard of an executive order.America will also be a safe society.I mean, many of the countries and there aren’t – that you associate with terrorism.I will not say that.The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.Okay?I talk to them.And you know the guy is – like 2,000 people showed up.We are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country.The Angel Moms.And I think the thing that’s changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that I’d be running for President.Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?Go ahead.We say let’s have a meeting.(Applause.)He calls me, "Donald, I want to help.And then eventually, weâ€™re getting the whole thing and weâ€™ll complete the wall.We will never hesitate to do what we must to keep us safe today, but we will always seek a more peaceful tomorrow.You know, we’re having a celebration.Is anybody surprised at that though?And you look at Schumer and the mess that heâ€™s got over there, and they have nothing going.LIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.Heâ€™s a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed â€” did very, very well.He was so rough.Now everything about Obamacare was a lie.Your cops and soldiers â€” thank you.I contributed to everybody.So I now say Iâ€™m a fair trader.That’s not a good sign.Itâ€™s a movement of the people.Number one with Hispanics.There are a lot of good people.I said, "Let’s go.Let’s start smart first.Walker.Bye!They’ve taken everything.Where is A.J.The Obama administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information.It’s a movement.You understand that.We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 21 percent.Mexico made a very good deal.If she doesn’t become president, she could have a real problem.Now, I may be wrong.Take me in, oh tender woman,’ cried the broken snake.We’re going to have people come through and they’re going to come through legally.I think it’s awfully hard to say that’s not the person we want to lead the party, right?That was not laughing at me.He’s actually a great reporter.I want borders.In fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as I’m concerned.Stand up.O’Malley.They’re going to be coming out very soon.Can you believe it?I want to start that process so quickly.You need Trump.All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day.You talk about discipline.THE PRESIDENT:  I do.And that’s on a yearly basis the $58 billion.And on top of that, it’s going to cost the country a fortune.The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else Iâ€™ve negotiated for the government.Weâ€™re going to put them back to work.If I don’t win, I have wasted my time."Any more?Our country is less than average.We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say.And I think we close it out before the convention.Well, let me â€” if I could call on â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Wouldnâ€™t make any difference to me.WHO IS BETTER AT THAT?We lose with borders.Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27th and 28th in Vietnam.God bless you.I never saw so many people – talented people, great people.While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.Iâ€™m involved.We’re going to bring them back.So I said, "I agree.I have many websites, many, many websites.I forgot."Thank you.I mean, I think China is terrific.And it’s bad for the economy.But Chris understands the problem, fully understands.I donâ€™t want to have it just here.But beautiful, beautiful bikes...You know, two days ago I was greatly honored because the Border Patrol, the folks that do a great job, and they’re told to stand back but they don’t want to stand back.Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.They get it.Not going to happen anymore.Itâ€™s a rare exception that we donâ€™t.We’re sorry for everything.It’s not 5.3%.The country is going to go to hell but we won’t talk of that.She didnâ€™t do anything.Thereâ€™s no choice left.What happens is you will not have – and very importantly – you will not have Supreme Court justices.I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess.And I said to Senator Blunt and I said to Billy Long on the plane coming in â€” can I say â€œMissouri,â€ or should I say â€œMissouruhâ€?Ideally â€” and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury â€” we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries, but still, by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world.They said, "It comes from the southern border.But we’re getting rid of it.But they had to pay over a billion dollars.Well, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together.Enjoy yourself."Theyâ€™re all leaving.I love John Deere, too.He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student.We’re going to win again.Actually, thatâ€™s the only mistake they made.And I think the fact that Obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves Israel to support this guy or even the Democratic Party is impossible to believe.But listen, I appreciate it, fellas, I appreciate it.No, you haven’t been treated fairly.(Applause.)This is a very dark moment in America’s history.And I said very strongly exactly what happened.We got ISIS and many other problems in return.They’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.But we had a very, very good talk.And they have one of the highest ratings they’ve had in a long time.After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave "reviews"—there was very little criticism.They always do.They go this way, 10 feet.The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality.China is building in the South China Sea massive military bases.Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all.They want it rebuilt.I’ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.You look at so many different â€” you look at Paris.Okay, first of all, he thinks it’s a good press announcement.I said, what about this country?This isn’t when it was originally formed like many, many years ago, many decades ago, and you have to re-do things.I wasn’t too involved in picking the organizations other than to the Marine Law Enforcement.Weâ€™ve had a good talk.We got some bad ones.They go on television and talk.And I filed.But we’ll see.I’m two, three, and you see that – two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else.But we’re going to knock the crap out of them, I’ll tell you what.You look at some of our airports; it’s third world.And I convinced them to sell me the land and the building.I watched their broadcasts.The fact is, this reporter said that.Okay?You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group.They have the cameras right in my face.When I started off today by saying that itâ€™s so important to the public to get an honest press.So when you have something that everybody wants and you can’t make a deal, there’s something going on that’s really wrong.Right?But they’re not allowed to talk because they’re petrified.We’re going to build a wall.I mean, people love it and I love it because it says what’s going to happen to us if we’re not careful.And I end up with this big story – "Trump accepting contributions".Not going to happen.I don’t know.For three years, they can’t make a deal.THEY'RE GOING TO BE A NUCLEAR POWER AND THEY ARE RICH AND POWERFUL.THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, really?Do you want to set up the meeting?Remember, he was going to win that in a landslide.And they are certainly being very nice to me tonight.Thank you.In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways, academically â€” was an academic genius â€” and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual?I’m not using donors.He’s a traitor.We get Bergdahl.We’re going to get it.You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and thereâ€™s just nothing like whatâ€™s happening.Both of them want Trans-Pacific.Iâ€™m actually having a very good time, okay?(Applause.)Look at Brussels.Women at a 17-year low.I mean, whoever hears that?Right there, the flag.Heâ€™s great, but I interviewed other great people for this job.I was saying if they would work, if they would have worked so hard, so diligently against President Barack Hussein Obama, they would have beaten him.All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.The only good thing.They want to work.And I think you’re going to have – I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.They’re the best people.We are doing well.Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldnâ€™t have done that.Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to have.And I will.CNN was very nice.Somebody said, "Oh, that’s crass."I built a great company.You go over to Qatar, you go over to some of these places in the Middle East.Now, I know the best.And itâ€™s open.Just the other day, Gen. [Ray] Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness.One night.(BOOING)


Hey, what are you going to do.If we stand for these things â€” safety, prosperity and peace â€” then there is no limit to what we can achieve:  A future where millions are lifted from welfare to work.And they said all of these people that are going to come in new, that never vote — they never vote, they don’t care — they’re going to mostly — I’ll tell you what, they’re going to vote for Trump.Me, I give them $10,000, OK?(Laughter.)Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that.But the racist word, itâ€™s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook, and Americans have had enough of it, OK. We get it.Unpredictable?I actually said — it’s funny.They include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever.They have it right on your face.And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand.We’re going to start winning again and we’re going to win big league.Weâ€™ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.And if you add Ben and myself we’re beating everybody by a lot.Or in your case caucus?We’re going to make our country great again.Don’t worry about Ukraine.At the end of six months and maybe sooner – with us we have a deal instinct.So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital.Immediately, I called them back and said, "Don’t do this."I do know Mitch McConnell a little bit but I hope to be able to get along with him.She didnâ€™t do anything.Does that sound like inexperienced?So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in:
creating jobs;
defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists--and you have to do that;
reducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it;
securing our Southern border--and I mean seriously securing it;
stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere;
saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it;
repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country.They’re destroying us in terms of economic development.We have to rebuild our infrastructure.Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.Theyâ€™ll do signs and theyâ€™ll do drawings that are inappropriate.And now I’m building all over the world, and I love what I’m doing.And soon the country’s going to start winning, winning, winning.With that being said, I want people to come into our country legally.WE LEFT LIKE FOOLS.I say, "That’s a terrible story.51%.TODAY I SEE BERNIE SANDERS GAVE HER THIS VERY YOU KNOW, SORT OF STRANGE ENDORSEMENT.They beat us all the time.It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth.We don’t build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million – can you imagine this?And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well stated.It was Trump 48%.And by the way we have no choice.If for some reason they want this system to continue the way it’s going now, which is not fair and not good, where we’re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East.These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.I know why you’re not going to support me and you know you’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money.They’d argue and they’d fight and they’d disagree and would have, you know, different views and things.And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood.Trillion.But then they’re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can’t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can’t do that to Ford."Itâ€™s the only word they know.USA!Do you believe this?I will say this: I am with the veterans 100%.WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING FOR US AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.I don’t think it’s supply side or anything else.Six people were killed.I love you too.And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.But I made a lot of money in Atlantic City.And for themselves.Right?We ought to send used equipment, right?Really stupid leadership.He should have been terminated long ago.But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.We need law and order.They’re disgusted by what’s happening to our country.It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well.I happen to believe it’s more than $2.5 trillion.Your kids are going to be educated locally.As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, â€œNever Trump.â€ And Paul just left and heâ€™s given us his total support.You have developed a full-fledged case of what many in the media call Trump Derangement Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over it!Was she jailed?We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.You know, the Persians are great negotiators.My patients are beside themselves.It’s wrong.I could settle that case.Another one.But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.Itâ€™s been 60 days since my inauguration, and that was a promise that Iâ€™ve really kept.Yes.You know when I won – New Hampshire is a special place to me because they were the first victory I had.Got it done in four months.That’s the good thing.They are considered statistically employed.I understand.But you would have all done the same thing again.It’s a catastrophe.Why are we protecting you?â€  And do you want to know what they said after about two minutes of talking?They’re disgusted when a woman who’s nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years.The King of Jordan seems like a nice man.He was a very strong opponent, and now heâ€™s a very strong ally.I want Ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good.I think it’s probably going to be her because it’s rigged.And the Republicans coalesced around each other.He started it.I’m not using the lobbyists.â€œOkay, Iâ€™ll answer this one.These are con artists.I’m in Florida all the time.I vote for you.I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what weâ€™ve done.Any by the way, I love the concept — I love, love, love having a woman president.If it werenâ€™t, I wouldnâ€™t be telling you about it, I promise.I mean, I watch CNN â€” itâ€™s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.John Rich.They want protection.The question is â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Do we forget about that?Thank you.And you can ask this group of very talented people â€” they agreed with me.(Laughter.)Iâ€™ll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that Iâ€™ve ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing.But everybody thought that was a horrible thing.You would have had a war, and you would have lost millions, not thousands.And sometimes, I mean â€” I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.They’re not going to be able to do what we do with the military.Okay?There was with Obama.You know how it works.We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.And Iâ€™ve done a job.We were much, much higher, more than double everybody.I think we actually close it out before the convention.And when that happens, you’re going to see an economy that takes off.We are also making historic investments in the American military because we cannot have prosperity without security.We are going to tear up and make great and very lucrative and everybody is going to be happy, including the other side, trade deals.You’re not going to run.WE'VE GOT TO STOP HILLARY CLINTON, WHO IS AS CROOKED AS THEY COME.I didn’t know."Youâ€™ll be very happy, my Cuban friends.So, the largest audience in the history of (inaudible).Our military has been incredible.They’ll pay $500, $1,000 because it’s so complicated.AND EVERY TIME I GO HOME AND MY WIFE SAYS HOW WAS THE CROWD.What does that mean?It’s got to be that way.So protect the Second Amendment.We have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it’s not going to happen any longer.You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one-yard line, they go ah, ah I can't close it.We have to bring it together.They lost him backstage.TPP will be almost as bad as NAFTA.Some of them I have to compete with and I really â€” actually, I donâ€™t like very many of them.(Applause.)I want to thank the President.I’m down in some.I don’t know if you saw – I guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in Nevada.We're going to get rid of the whole theme because what's going to happen -- make America great again, right?He knows he’s unfair.We are going to embrace the possibilities of change.Good.THE PRESIDENT:  Lieutenant Colonel â€” good job.Go out and vote.Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.And I want to thank you very much.Madam Secretary, is that right?I’m doing this all for them.And I’ll tell you what.We have such power and we don’t know it.And frankly, other people should get out because I would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the United States and more importantly how we can solve the problems.The Democrats want the money to come back.But I’m the only one self-funding my campaign.That’s the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business, taking our money, and taking our jobs.And other things have gone up.And I said, oh, this is too bad, but weâ€™ll go right through it.It was â€” itâ€™s a joke.So I think we’re going to do well.Iâ€™ll be back.To Jeb Bush it wasn’t important because he didn’t want to fund them.They're walking.And the bill is just the opposite of that.So I only like to say that because I love honesty.Iâ€™ll probably never get it, but thatâ€™s okay.Now, hereâ€™s the thing â€”

Q    (Inaudible) many sides.Okay?So he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says – a couple of years ago – "Don’t use this term", and now he’s using it because he has to.Thank you, Miami.It is disgusting.So, with that being said, weâ€™ll take some questions and â€” yes, please.Yes, weâ€™ll do you next, Jim.THEY ARE BUYING PROBABLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT, OKAY.They can’t do anything.44%.And we’re going to win big and it’s going to be America first.Weâ€™re starting trade talks with Japan.On foreign policy, Trump way up.So let’s start with China.And what we did is we told them to stop that ad and that was a week ago.Because like tomorrow night we’re having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate.There are some we live with.And we’re gonna be there very soon.If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?I think the country â€” look, you take a look.He took it.But we have so many people like that.Bing, bing.And one of the things my son, Eric, told me, which I didn’t even realize, is that not only did I win most of the states — and some are coming in and I’m expected to win them — but I came in second — I came in no worse than second.You can certainly have Islamic terrorists.The difference is she’s been there for a long period of time.I’m self funding."…It’s a great honor.I didnâ€™t want to do â€” if you asked General Mattis, for a year and a half, I said, â€œWhy donâ€™t we stop these ridiculous,â€ in my opinion, â€œthe military games?â€  I call them the â€œmilitary games.â€  If I told you how much those games cost â€” and, frankly, I told South Korea, â€œYou should be paying for these games.â€  We pay for them.The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa.They wouldn’t be there except for us.I could say, "Well, I just want to do well in Iowa."We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.And that’s nothing compared to what some are doing.Not right.You know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and they’re standing.Obamacare is a disaster, folks.But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000.And really great assets.I want to thank my family.But we don’t know.Right, Ivanka?Do we win at all?Thousands of deaths.It’s killing us.(Applause.)We love Christmas.You’ve won even if you don’t win.I think I’m the only one that’s self-funding.THE PRESIDENT: Good.Weâ€™re going to keep our citizens safe.There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.Now, he’s one of the few.You know why?THE PRESIDENT:  And we love the coal miners.Since the moment I won the election, the Democrat Party has been possessed by Impeachment Fever.Look, I find the press to be extremely dishonest.I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.It’s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.I’ve fought for my family.But you have some absolutely incredible kids â€” I would say mostly â€” they were brought here in such a way â€” itâ€™s a very, very tough subject.Mick Mulvaney.Please, you’ll have to do – you have to do it."We get a traitor.CBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we’re at 35% to a small number.I got credit.You’re never going to be able to use it.But Iâ€™m not okay when it is fake.And we have to do something importantly about it.I’ll bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that we’re all in this together, folks.Iran’s a part of that one too.So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it’s big and complex, and they’ve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.Weâ€™ve wanted to do it.No, I know that.It’s a disaster.We got nothing.He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that.And some of you know who she is.They’re always sitting together.Yet Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday.THE PRESIDENT: Okay.Look, I don’t know.The African-Americans want jobs.Thirty years later, as President, Lincoln signed the law that built the first Transcontinental Railroad, uniting our country from ocean to ocean.But thatâ€™s only one example.The oil they don’t get ISIS is getting.If some guy that’s having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he’s going to take ads for Trump?So I announced that I’m running for president.We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.So I am going to be very good for the world.I want to keep it that way.We will protect our borders at home.I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer.We’re doing actually great.We're going to put them back to work.That’s something that makes me feel really, really very good.They’re taking $150 billion.Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.We must learn from the mistakes of the past.Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson.Itâ€™s not like, oh, gee, itâ€™s going to be wonderful in three years.You look at all of these different places have been destroyed.We have to stop, and it has to stop now.But when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force.China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.So I even had liberal people from CBS – I actually said to the CBS guy "Yes?"Recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation.It happened when â€” if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, weâ€™re back to the old games with the United States.It’s wrong.It’s what I do.Mexico is not helping.Actually I did a good job didn’t I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said – I do what every other great businessman does.Let me â€”

Q    â€” if youâ€™re not prepared to come forward with the evidence, sir?It takes a little while to get the facts.And the odds were 20 percent.Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank.Iâ€™m in Wisconsin.And every time, I have statisticians.This is serious NRA, both of them, both of them.We’re losing a lot of our doctors because of Obamacare.That would be great for television...
Go ahead.They can do whatever they want for 13 years.But on the economy, they give me 55 — 55 percent.To me, that’s a compliment.It’s incredible."What happens?And we’re going to take care of our vets.She was always the highest quality that youâ€™ll ever find.People can come into our country but they’re going to come in legally.They don’t know if it worked.It’s the fact that people that are running against me and people in the Senate, people in Congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and they’re special interests and they do what those people want.They’d just say, "Chris, tonight we’re closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you."But we’re doing really well.They don’t have to develop – I was telling somebody they don’t have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it.You know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how we’re the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don’t respect us and they don’t take care of us and they don’t treat us right in many cases.They’re great people....Thank you, everybody.It’s now less than a year and you know we have the Iowa starts on February 1st and then we go right down the line and it’s very exciting.Go ahead.The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.Because they always treat me badly also.There is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens.You canâ€™t do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places.So then I read every time it comes out I hear 5.3% unemployment.There’s an unbelievable love in all of these places – Oklahoma – 20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice.Even if I lose, I’ll pledge it, okay?Oh, they’re totally wrong.He was ready to go to war.A little bit sometimes are right but they’re all negative.We’re going to have an incredible period in Cleveland.Thank you.Remember, we built China.You understand that.And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then weâ€™ll get another bad ruling.So they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that’s how much money.TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CROWD.But I didn’t want to just bomb the oil.And then you get into legal semantics.I’m going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste.Thatâ€™s the motherlode.Rush Limbaugh â€” I think heâ€™s a great guy.It’s true.We will make America great again.We’ve got Social Security that’s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn’t bring money into the country.Two young guys.And you know what happened?14th Amendment covers it.You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room.I feel safe.I have many of these.You know why?We’re going in the wrong direction.And it is true, this is my first stop, officially.So I said we’re going to try to get rid of that and I think we’ll be very, very successful.Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly."Well, will they show up to vote?"I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.Won the big tournament, the world championship of golf.My administration is proud to have led historic efforts, at the United Nations Security Council and all around the world, to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean Peninsula.This isn’t like it’s a close match.I’m happy.Heâ€™s going to be fantastic.They didn’t put numbers up.Say it again.I mean, you think Obama has energy?And weâ€™re going to have a wall that works.AUDIENCE:  USA!Ready?I mean, he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal.I meant it.Adam Scott – the great Adam Scott – the great golfer.Also with us tonight â€” a man who I have a lot respect for, gave me a very early endorsement â€” former Vice President Dick Cheney, along with his daughter, Congressman Liz Cheney.Thatâ€™s enough, please.We get Bergdahl.It’s just taking them over.There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.We’re moving to Mexico."But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.But she said, "If you actually run – not you may run, you may not run, who knows?"You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.So, in coming over today and in going through a few of them, I said to a few of the folks I’ve got to explain what’s happening because our country is being decimated by stupidity, by bad deals, by horrible trades, by TPP, which Cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy Wisconsin.And Iâ€™d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.â€  And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.I have friends in Wisconsin.I don’t think he’s a — are you a protester?$24 trillion.THE PRESIDENT: Jim, you know what it is?Youâ€™re sending us millions of cars.When I heard about it, I figured maybe not.They have something in common.WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE THE DEAL TO GET OUT OF YEMEN AND KERRY SAID BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME PLIBLG ATE -- COMPLICATE THE NEGOTIATIONS.And they don’t know — "Are you running?I SAID DO ME A FAVOR.We all hopefully have a good life.It’s not going to happen."Same with China.(Applause.)"No, sir, we’re not making nuclear weapons.And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win.I can’t tell you that.I would love to see the Republican Party and everybody get together and unify.It's horrible out there.And people said, â€œTrump is crazy.â€  And you know what it ended up being?I mean.Think of that."Yeah.No longer.Said I won’t run.And ours is cutting and reforming.He is a man who â€” there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.I’ve been watching politicians now for years – all talk, no action politicians.As far as the actual making the call â€” in fact, Iâ€™ve watched various programs and Iâ€™ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.The deal is done.WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK.For three hours, he speaks.Many, many calls I've made.We’ve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we’ve got to do it now because later is too late — going to be too late for our country.You know, Iâ€™m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.(Applause.)Governor, thank you.Q    Youâ€™re getting letters from Chairman Kim.I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn’t even know what the hell I was talking.You can do very nice but why don’t you get her out because honestly it’s inappropriate.PARTICIPANT:  None of us watch it either anymore.On illegal immigration, Trump 48%.And I think everybody in this room knows it.THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB.Weâ€™re keeping our promises.Weâ€™ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic â€” and it is a fantastic â€” new F-35 jet fighter, and weâ€™ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.And I said...I was supposed to say, "No, there’s not.Our country could be doing much better.To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again.Q Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.I think he’s a very low energy person and I don’t think that’s what the country needs.It’s been amazing.Now, maybe in a few years I’ll have to run against him.What people want now, they want jobs.Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes.And think about Boeing.They built a wall 2,000 years ago that’s 13,000 miles.But I want to tell you, will you – I refuse to say "Get your asses in gear."Japan over $100 billion.Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs.Never again, only the reverse — and I have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen.That’s a good — I can do great job at $10 billion.I’m going to do great with virtually every group.(Applause.)AND NOW WE RAISED $51 MILLION LAST MONTH AND WE STARTED TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH.I think the media is frankly made up of people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people.USA!But this has to be a two-way street.And we aren’t supposed to call them or anything.Mexico both at the border and in trade.And Hillary Clinton has already said sheâ€™s going to put the miners out of business.So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.Where’s Sharon?Please stand up, Bill.You know that.I’m here today to tell you that we have to change.I mean, give me a break.They've never heard them.So we spend more money for pupil than any country in the world and we are ranked number 28 which is way down at the bottom, essentially.You know, he was just doing his job.I know a lot that you have heard of that aren’t really that good, that are overrated in my opinion.Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries.If I had to do it again, I would have done the exact same thing.President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach.You’re going to have more World Trade Centers.I always say this – nobody can do this stuff better than me.I could be someplace else right now.And always — always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again.And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that weâ€™re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.If we remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy.And most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially.He worked hard on he — I know how hard he worked actually, and so I congratulate Ted Cruz on that win.Five: I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator.Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk, and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her.The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.…I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought we’d do this well this fast.We have rewarded the world’s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.You know, why should I pay?So I want to begin by thanking my boys, Eric has been all over the place making speeches.Honestly.I can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they’re better than Obama and they’re better than Kerry and they’re better than the foolish people – the foolish people.Number one on the polls and we love those people.So, they all say — then they go back home, after the debate.I might have filed if I wasn’t going to run.The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call.Where is Jerry?Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.YOU CAN CALL IT WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT.Then the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs.That means medical.â€œNot well, not well.â€ Why?I’m just saying I’m telling the story.So I got great credit.Q    What will you do to elevate their position to support them in order â€” after they help the United States to defeat ISIS?They don’t know where to begin.These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.We’re going to bring industry and plants.Not now.THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead, set up the meeting.Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too – but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed.We won with every – virtually every category.Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same.THE PRESIDENT:  I would have gotten bad story in the New York Times.True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.Now, in Ben’s case, his Super PAC is running Iowa.I mean, they want me to refute his statement.They’re going to built a plant, $2.5 billion in Mexico.I donâ€™t know, Peter, is that one right?Go ahead.But they displayed it.The cars are pouring off the ships.But they only want to talk three.It’s going to be easy.We just left Alabama, which was unbelievable.We have a lot more people.What are we doing; why aren't they paying us?As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort â€” not all the time â€” and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; theyâ€™re honest and fantastic.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.Many of you are Republicans.They’re gonzo, they’re gone or they’re failing badly, OK, and they’ll be gone soon.He shouldn’t be wasting his time.They said I was wearing a toupee and I was screaming but they didn’t.Can you imagine if I said weâ€™re not going to build a wall?But I want to apologize.I love the people in this room.And we’re just not in a position that we’re in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place.So the debates — thank — I love you too, darling.There’s no leadership.You know, last season you know how well it did.Weâ€™ve had great conversations with the United Kingdom â€” and meetings â€” Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.They are furious because I sent people checks of a lot of money.He refuses to say.So, Director of National Intelligence just put out â€” acting â€” a statement: â€œAny suggestion that the United States intelligence communityâ€ â€” this was just given to us â€” â€œis withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.â€

So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal â€” top â€” and they just wrote the story is not true.Crime is rising.But that’s okay because I’m here right now to thank you in person and that was my biggest dream.Everything is remaining.Now, those people are starting to get interest.If he wins, great.And thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so tough, because thereâ€™s been so much hatred and anger for so many years.First of all, I’m sure that out of some of them they stole the money.And everyone said "Well, I don’t know."This is a great group.Caterpillar’s stock is down.Youâ€™ll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because theyâ€™re in states that I won by 30 and 40 points and theyâ€™re going to give us votes.I say, "Wait a minute.They can’t make a deal because there’s such gridlock.I don’t want to be tough — you know, I know a lot of tough guys but they’re not smart, and they’re the — they’re the easiest.So important.A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.Iâ€™m amazed by it.Q    Right.It’s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.I know, nice.And if I’m elected president, that will not change, I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years....You people do it.You have great weather but Florida has great weather.That’s the first time I’ve — you know, that’s what you say."They can keep it.My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.This wasn't close.Thereâ€™s rarely been a problem.So what happened is they showed the poll.Ambassador Sondland testified that I told him: â€œNo quid pro quo.How come they’re doing -?"WE HAVE TO END IT.I only hit people when they hit me.Thank you.Whereâ€™s Billy?Their leaders are too smart for us.(Applause.)All of the money has been paid out and I’m going to give it to you in just a second.Didnâ€™t he have a couple of things in his past?That’s what’s happened in this country.In fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, I’m about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient.We don’t win with our military.Iâ€™ll tell you what.THE PRESIDENT:  Doesnâ€™t matter what world leaders think on Iran.Huh?Hey, I went to Ivy League school.All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.Thatâ€™s a ruse.After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path.(Applause.)But I take great care – education and health care – and my people are very happy.Iâ€™ve outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.This includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses.They can buy them.When you ask about, as an example, the FBI â€” why didnâ€™t they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing?I mean, this guy is unbelievable.We have plenty of time.I WON'T EVEN SAY WHAT THINGS -- I COULD GO ONE AFTER ANOTHER.BUT BILL O'REILLY SAID, THE SINGLE GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENON THAT HE'S SEEN IN HIS LIFETIME.But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.Not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace – all talk, no action politicians – they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it....Recently, I was in Florida and Marco, who’s a nice guy actually.We’re a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws.It’s not going to happen.Disgusting.We have to rebuild our country.Give me a break.I don’t even know if he knows what the hell is going on.Weâ€™re going to keep companies.And the next president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our atmosphere....Let me tell you this.For far too long â€” all the way back to 1979, to be exact â€” nations have tolerated Iranâ€™s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond.When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people.He did that.That was Chuck Todd.Can you believe that?Itâ€™s possible that they will be convincing.But I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met.I was the fair hair person.And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school â€” because itâ€™s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left â€” she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.I have to deal with a lot of politicians, donâ€™t forget, and I have to convince them that what Iâ€™m saying is right.We have no idea what’s going to happen on the Democrat’s side but they’re certainly having difficulty.Nucor is opening up plants.Anyways, it’s sort of a little bit complicated…I bought it.You know, don’t say this, don’t say that.But I love you all.And it will be tomorrow, I assume.And the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama.We handed it to them.I mean, they’re the worst ads.Going to have all the troops out.It was incredible and we’ve done so well with the evangelicals.But there was a cameraman that was in front of it.Theyâ€™re having big problems.It’s like a bankrupt magazine…They don’t even know my numbers.Why are they playing soccer is my question.Nothing.Do it.That’s sort of like a magic act.Let’s take me.Itâ€™s like he knew.He lived – he was a joint citizen.Give me a break.However, since 2002 – the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports – that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.OUR VETS ARE BEING TREATED SO BADLY.I don’t think I’d take it if we had two people but I think I’d take if we had three.OK. I’ve got 15,000, I don’t know what the hell he means by that but that’s OK.But the police do an unbelievable job.You’ve got to be a mastermind.In 1986, Ronald Reagan led the world by cutting our corporate tax rate to 34 percent.Our leaders are stupid and — and/or — you have to say and/or they have deals, because what’s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do — our leaders, can you believe our leaders?And they put her poll up and it was put up there.I’ve got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us.Stand up, honey.Never once did Ukraine complain about pressure being appliedâ€”not once!I remember years ago, Iâ€™d go to Washington â€” I* was always very politically active â€” and Republicans and Democrats, theyâ€™d fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.Somebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn’t have to make.We can’t be.Thatâ€™s called the wheelhouse.There are very few people â€” very few people.And I understand that he may want to run for President.Okay?Because Iâ€™ve done a lot of work.Univision, because 70% of their business comes from Mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the Mexican Government.We have one commitment long-term for Arkansas actually where we’re going to have about 10,000 people.I actually said what about recommissioning – look at this thing.And honestly, look, he’s getting the money from special interests.I don’t really want to tell you."Throughout history, itâ€™s always been a general â€” you had to be a general â€” but mostly it was politicians.This is going to happen quickly.AND YOU'RE ALL OVER.And these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they’re told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors.They don’t like me anymore.We have a fantastic, hopefully, new justice of the Supreme Court.She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.I’m embarrassed to talk about it.Oh, they just said one of the biggest applause lines – it’s true – I get is when I talk about my daughter Ivanka.I don’t know how he wins in Iowa.This is a wateredâ€“down version of the first one.But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint.He is not a natural born citizen.He has been great.But when I didn’t do that one event, the debate, I gave a speech.We’re taking from the independents.I want to thank all of our distinguished guests who are with us today, including members of our Cabinet:  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and, of course, our Transportation Secretary â€” who is doing a fabulous job â€” Elaine Chao.Also, itâ€™s not for the FBI.I don’t want to tell ISIS what I’m going to do to knock the hell out of them.I really mean this.Not good.This is a moral issue.So, when the people up on the stage with me — and Hillary, Hillary doesn’t have a clue.We’re going to stop this.She said, "I don’t want you to read it.I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.WE WOULD HAVE SAVED $150 BILLION.It’s going to be a friend again.We’re going to win with our Second Amendment.But he was favored for a period of time.So Iâ€™m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.I donâ€™t talk to her.So when I get 53% – and this one is an example, I had 53% and that’s with four people.Japan is very concerned with North Korea.There has never been a better time to come to America.They’ll all come back.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.Iâ€™m going to meet with him tomorrow.We've had so many -- we've had so many incredible endorsements and to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important.So, they’re very dishonest people.The trade — that’s so easy for me.Is that okay?(Applause.)It’s always difficult.And that’s what I wanted.Bob.That’s when we become a country that’s unsalvageable.Remember that.THEY HAVE THEIR BEST NEGOTIATORS.And guess what?Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case?Everybody agrees it should be brought back in.I don’t know.Not good.So you went many years and they never changed it.I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides.She said, they didn’t show it.Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.But you know, I’m leading big in Florida.Q    Hannah Thomas-Peter from Sky News.We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.It’s so important...
Actually what I don’t understand because the one guy that’s doing pretty good with me in Iowa is Ted Cruz and he’s a nice guy.And I have a number-one bestseller out?My hands are normal hands.And I kept waiting.Okay?Now, recent polls have shown that I’m beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has made tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially.Its journey began by the South Lawn of the White House, at a monument known today as Zero Milestone.And we’re not going to let that happen.It’s good for all of us."He’s practically crying because he can’t justify.We have 28,000 soldiers at the border.This will include the countries in TPP, which are very important.I’m a free trader.Look at what’s happening in Germany.And we will not let them back in.Theyâ€™re very â€” not because theyâ€™re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.They’re going to be back.It’s called no respect.But if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years, many years, we would be much stronger in a sense.We will defeat ISIS overseas.Some are nice.Where is that?Iâ€™m in Michigan.The relationship is fantastic.You know, Al Green – the great Al Green wrote "The Snake".BUT WE DSHTIDN'T DO THAT.But this one is something â€” is going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps â€” you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important.They are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it — and they’re building air fields and they’re building forts.But I think thereâ€™s been no country thatâ€™s changed so much as Iran.Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.And by the way, and I have to tell you — and he was very, very nasty.They always keep our equipment.FOR THE KILLER, FOR THE KILLER.So anyway, I bet you have a great wife.And by the way, we had to go â€” had no choice â€” had to go with the healthcare first.It’s as simple as that.Thank you.How about Thomas Jefferson?We spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and we’re in 28th place.And now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things.I’m self-funding my campaign.And they’re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.What did they do?I said he’s a disaster.So we think they’re going to really be – why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote?Because right now, you have to go out – people who aren’t doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans.And they possibly have to do it.(Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.I’ll tell you what in terms of income inequality, we’re going to create a lot of jobs.He said, "Well, you know, the Asians come in and they also have anchor babies."No, it doesn’t have to be privatization.You know, today theyâ€™d say that.And so I didn’t want to announce because I didn’t want to like announce and things didn’t work out and I’m like some of these guys where they’re zero.Another thing and it’s sort of interesting, one of the Super PACs I believe has $6 million.Have to do it.If you look at whatâ€™s going on, companies are leaving left and right.So, I just want to finish by saying this.We went up in June.I love the Hispanics.Remember all of the broken promises?SHE WAS SO GUILTY.And they were going to raise your taxes.But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around.Look at this.Remember?I’ll bring back our jobs, and I’ll bring back our money.She’s being protected absolutely.And I recognized immediately.The bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into American and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing.I think that he is a fringe candidate...when you do a little research on that I think it’s not going to be a factor.Q Mr. President â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Just like CNN, right?Can you believe it?Okay, yeah, go ahead.But now we don’t need the credit because we’re going after Hillary Clinton.The biggest bank in the world is from China.They think it was probably $8 million was spent against me and we spent $900,000.And we’re not going to let these Syrian folks in that we don’t know who they are.I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: â€œMade in the USA.â€  (Applause.)NAFTA was a disaster for Wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country.Thank you.Oh, did they go after her…She took a lot of incoming.I’m nothing and I’m at the top.A lot of you don’t know we protect Germany.And you’re going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it.I’m so honored by this evening.Every single poll, every single state.Letâ€™s take an ad â€” letâ€™s use one of those PACs.I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support, the only way you could’ve done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win; 37 primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.Was George Washington a slave owner?Law enforcement and Border Patrol.And that's what it is.I won.We will be environmentally friendly, but weâ€™re not going to put our businesses out of work and weâ€™re not going to lose our jobs.We get the drugs, they get the money.And we need the right people.Rush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said "Trump has received more incoming than any human being I’ve ever seen.We’re going to do it.And in the West Bank they’re openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist’s home that’s been destroyed.So I gave $5,600,000.And we’re not going to let other countries take it away from us because that’s what’s been happening for far too many years and we’re not going to do it anymore.Trump 48%.I just want to say that we’re going to come out with some plans in a very short time.They’re great.As an example, Hillary Clinton – no tough questions.They know we have a real problem.Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.I want to knock the hell out of ISIS.We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.He’s plateaued" at 6%, right?But youâ€™re going to see.Tell him to leave.Right?And they didn’t want to talk about it.I’d say 100%.They’re paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they’d like to move back to these countries.She wants to make America whole again and I’m trying to figure out what is that all about.That’s okay."We’ve got to fix our health care program.Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet.But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money.(Applause.)Got a little shake-up in Iowa.So itâ€™s a problem.Thank you all very much.Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.He’s controlled by these people, folks.So they have the oil.I mean it.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?These are foolish people.Forever.So as our family we're incredibly proud.Thatâ€™s the way it is.The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems â€” or she â€” or she.It’s real estate.You know one of the reasons we didn’t bomb the oil?I said here’s general so and so, one of the top, top, top people.And I actually spoke to one today who was vicious.But I understand it.But he lost.Do you want to hear it?USA!Who knows?They’re our great people.Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with rules and regulations; you need them.I think itâ€™s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people can’t veto.Okay?Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.With both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.But otherwise, weâ€™re having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury.And I was so proud.REINCE PRIEBUS, DOING A GREAT JOB.Thatâ€™s a big story.â€  And it was â€” for Fox.The worst.It’s like peanuts.Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.We owe $19 trillion.There’s no — there’s no — there’s no word like that.You know, we had a case just about when I was coming into office â€” you all remember it â€” where there was a massive â€” they thought it was an earthquake.As an officer in the Army after World War I, he joined a military convoy that trekked across the nation to the Pacific Coast.I assume theyâ€™re terrorists.Very well ...The liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation.No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy.But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.I don’t know how many.If the right person asked them, they’d pay a fortune.Now, with Mexico – and I love Mexico.These numbers that these people have – and I often ask myself.And then they come out with a voter violation form, which is a fraud as far as I’m concerned.This could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was.Nobody else would have done that.It will be built.THE PRESIDENT:  Good job.They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say "cutter" but I've always said "qatar" so I'll keep it "qatar" what the hell.And we’re not going to have that stuff anymore.We're going to do the wall.But they actually had people – a lot of people – people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn’t get it done.Boom!"It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.The purchase of drug equipment.If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests.I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasnâ€™t big on picking judges.He’ll never make it.Then they said, "And if he does, he’ll ask for many, many delays because you’re entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever.It added up to over $40 million.I think that our president has been unbelievably rude to Bibi.But I was sort of kidding.AND I WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH A WHOLE LITANY OF THAT, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO.And I will tell you, they’re going to end up liking us better than they do right.I toss and turn thinking about how I’m going to make the best deal for you folks.It has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive.It would have been fine.Now, in all fairness, Jeb Bush was doing a lot better than that.With a wall, it would be very easy.Sit down.When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss.I believe in free trade.He failed.So I want to congratulate Ted.At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, â€œThe United States has never lost a war.â€ And then, after that, itâ€™s like we havenâ€™t won anything.You saw the filings.One of them actually said — one of them — I’m special.I also want to thank my staff, Paul, Cory, Pope.Okay?Because, you know, I love these kids.We’re going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for the wall.Nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word.First of all, congratulations to the Iowa State basketball team.We spoke today in Kentucky.Iâ€™m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nationâ€™s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.An incredible guy, respected by all â€” Senator Lamar Alexander.Does that make sense to anybody?I think it’s going to be very hard.(Applause.)I’m not bragging about spending.I can see that.Itâ€™s never happened.And sometimes we need it very badly for security â€” security of our country.Everybody in Atlantic City.So my plan, my tax plan, is something I’m very proud of.But I actually believe they’ll do better because I think the economy will grow.It affects them.They’re going to go to local doctors or local hospitals.He said, "I thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands."Well, you’ll see it in court documents.By saying that, I put it out there.And you have athletes – very few – but there are some people that have a certain ability.(Applause.)About Iran, one question: What is your clear plan to stop Iranian influence in Iraq, in Syria, and especially in Iraqi Kurdistan?Two, quickly, questions:  What will be the U.S.A. relations with the Kurds â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I thought I just answered that.(Applause.)And theyâ€™re not doing this for money.There are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things.Nobody else wrote about it.Weâ€™ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and weâ€™ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.I was going to do all of this, but after Paris and California, and there will be others because they have no fear of us, but after Paris and California, it has totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points.And in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing.I’m not going to hit him.I said, "Jeb, I’m at 42, you are at 2.I may be able to find a couple that donâ€™t.They love their children and it’s local.They don’t have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say.And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.But a number of the pundits said, "well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it's going to equal Trump."A lot.Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win.But don’t worry about that.The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico.And we’re not going to make deals like that anymore.But if somebody had guns in there – nobody had a gun...How would you have done if you had a gun?Thank you.They’d leave for North Carolina.I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense who’ll know how to fight a war on radical Islamic terrorism.Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.But itâ€™s got to be a two-way street.Weâ€™re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.AND THEY'RE FIGHTING AND WEE FIGHTING.And we had another one in the morning, and it’s been an amazing day, and some phenomenal results.And yet, we do deals with China where there’s a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question.Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.And I took a deep breadth and I said, "Let’s go."They’re not even going through.And he always sits with John McCain.And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is â€” to me means something much different than it used to.But South Korea – LG, Samsung.I think it’s irrelevant.When Tom says he’s a great quarterback that’s pretty good.And they make promises and they’re all talk and they’re no action.They have been cleaned out.A lot of people don’t get that.I love you too.And I tell you that only for one reason – that’s the thinking we need in Washington.$50 million or more.Thatâ€™s so important to Ivanka Trump.But remember this.Thatâ€™s why when John asked about the FBI â€” if the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI, and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.Weâ€™ve delayed it a long time.Just say a few words.Walker.In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.You remember that, because their families know what’s going on OK?As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas.So the farmers and â€” by the way, the steel workers â€” you know, I stopped the dumping.Even this order was drawn and they didnâ€™t say that.What am I going to do?But if you saw whatâ€™s going on behind the scenes, I think youâ€™d very impressed.You’re going to be proud again to be miners.Their money is worthless.I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country.I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party.They can’t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.But in exchange, they must hire, invest and grow in America.We need a mentality that’s going to – you know, we’re at $19 trillion in debt.Sharon, did you take a lot of incoming?Jeff Sessions is one of the most highly respected people in the United States Senate.Weâ€™re trying to get along very well.We’re going to knock the hell out of ISIS.Weâ€™re opening up for farmers.The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.So letâ€™s also talk about a place called Venezuela.One thing I’m going to do I’ll tell you, I’m going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful – so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us.They’re not big for interviews.I say give me the stats on a state.And weâ€™ve done some really good work.But look at this.Is that a correct statement?$20 TRILLION.WE SEND THEM BEEF.So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.I ended up coming in second.I can tell you that.And then I have Cruz saying, "Oh, that was a terrible thing.You know, he’s going to be Robin Hood.You know, we don’t win very much.I saw the same pictures as you did.And they were horrendous.Clint Black.Our greatest American leaders â€” including George Washington, Hamilton, Jackson, Lincoln â€” they all agreed that for America to be a strong nation it must also be a great manufacturing nation.The infrastructure of our country is falling apart.So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.So, coming over I heard and I watched television – you know, they have all these cameras back there and they’re live.So maybe next time.This shows about 10, but that can go out to about 20 years to get something approved.And if you have any questions, we have â€” Mick, you can come up here please.And it’s so easy for him.They donâ€™t know how to define â€œtariff.â€  They donâ€™t know it is really different than a tax, although itâ€™s getting close.I donâ€™t want to go ahead of myself, but youâ€™ll be hearing about it soon.Right?I started as you know not very long ago – about six weeks ago – and I was told that I had a 20 point deficit.One day, we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians.Thereâ€™s no upside.Why didnâ€™t we take care of Yemen?But as of this moment, it’s $5.6 million.Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews.A house.They are not raising them because Obama has asked them not to raise them.Not going to happen.You would be so happy.I call and I call.Did you ever see a deal take so long?Right?If we can – you know, we have a movement going on, folks.I mean, they’re all pretty much — all of them, right?A deplorable, deplorable situation.So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren’t great before I announced.I was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned.I want to fix our bridges.But the courts will determine that.Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.(Applause.)Yeah, don’t forget that’s 33%.How can you miss with extreme weather, right?And when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places – you know, when you’re leading in every poll, they sort of want you.And I mean like double what anybody else pays.Weâ€™re going to have the cleanest water.I want them back."They’ve never seen anything like it.NO, I DON'T WANT THAT.Go ahead.Usually, that means weâ€™re going to get a good price.And then he doubled down a week later because I was right.We’ve got a real problem.No, I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.33,000 MISSING E-MAILS.PLEASE, PLEASE, MIKE, HELP US.When does it help us?Weâ€™re not surrendering anymore.They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story.You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days.There were 17.And I have group that I gave...[invites a veteran to speak]
...I could have asked all these groups – he just showed up.Because China is a very special place.So I’m very, very honored by the turnout, OK?I said, "Well, you know, it’s fine, but if I don’t win, it’s just a waste of time."I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.You know, with China, our people pay tax.(Applause.)I think thatâ€™s going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations.They go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect.Thank you!We will be celebrating for a long time tonight.Theyâ€™re not going to beat me in the election; they know that.Club for Growth.So, what happens is all of a sudden I see their name all over the place – "Club for Growth" and they talk about, you know, different things – ridiculous things.But can you imagine, we have 6 million – now, we know there’s not 6 million, there may be one.Weâ€™re going to build the wall.Why didnâ€™t somebody start doing that 25 years ago?And what happens?Clean coal.I said, "I’m going to work harder in Iowa."I would have never give — they’re using it — they don’t have to make nuclear.No, no, don’t buy the famous Obama administration.We will make America rich again.THE PRESIDENT:  Because his tariffs are too high, and he doesnâ€™t seem to want to move, and Iâ€™ve told him, â€œForget about it.â€  And frankly, weâ€™re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada.But think of it.Remember, I said very strongly — (inaudible) the oil for what, four years?But thatâ€™s not even second-guess; thatâ€™s called politics.I mean, look at the establishment.You have daughters.We donâ€™t win anymore.Radical Islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us.Thank you, though.But it is different.I would love to be able to get along with Russia.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay, well, thatâ€™s nice.It's really going well.Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think I’ll go over $6 million pretty easily.We tell the truth.Incredible guy.Okay?And they were stabilized.And the Democrats didnâ€™t even know there was a problem with ZTE.Believe me, I can take care of China in my back pocket.Or do they even bother putting it in?We have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all.(Applause.)In negotiation, you must be willing to walk.I don’t want the money.That last month – it was like he wasn’t even campaigning.Okay?That’s over.So [Scott] Walker came out today.AND WE DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES, ALL OF US, WE DON'T MAKE MISTAKES BUT WHAT THEY DO IS TAKE A SENTENCE AND MAKE IT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU SAID, MUCH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU MEANT.We’re further away now than we were 15 years ago.I’m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people.If they would have come back with the most perfect â€” â€œWe found everything, and heâ€™s perfectly innocent of everything.â€  It wouldnâ€™t have made a difference.You know that, right?That’s a good question.We go for the knock-out.So one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia.So we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories.With Iowa, I’m doing really well with the evangelicals.Q    Thank you, sir.Q    What does that mean for NAFTA?This woman is incredible.Somebody said "Oh, why isn’t everybody paying?"That was an excellent win.Instead of saying â€œthank youâ€ to the United States, they chanted â€œdeath to America.â€  In fact, they chanted â€œdeath to Americaâ€ the day the agreement was signed.Others, like â€” you know, there are charges that are pretty weak.But Kasich voted for NAFTA."Oh, Trump’s worth only $5 billion or $4 billion."So we’re – I think we’re doing good.The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration, at a cost of $2.5 trillion.The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, itâ€™s all about growth.He said — he said, "What you’ve done has never been done before in the history of this country."Nothing to do with me.That’s what happened.I love Harleys.And you know, I have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, we’ll just say all over the country.And weâ€™ve done a lot.(Applause.)Lots of Harleys, right?Tonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another.You know, they want to be a little cool.I don’t have to, believe it or not.So second amendment by the way -- this is a room loves the second

THE PRESIDENT:  It doesnâ€™t mean they had to report it because, in some instances, people keep it quiet.Believe me.AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NEVER BE NEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS.He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration.Itâ€™s why our unemployment rate is the lowest itâ€™s been in so many decades.HE'S A TOUGH GUY.We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.So I have to straighten out the military.It’s not nice."Most people donâ€™t even know he was a Republican, right?What do I know?You’re the only person that ever mentions the vets."Competitive person.You remember I took a deep breath because I’m telling you and you know what I’m talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards.I use E- verify.(Applause.)And of course, they’ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.I will take him over the governor anytime because we won.They’re staying.I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that.I mean, Lindsey Graham.She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is and she won’t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know.And he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support I have?And I said how can anybody endure this?I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country.Because I donâ€™t talk about military, and I donâ€™t talk about certain other things.We don’t win anymore.Weâ€™re going to save your Second Amendment.They asked me if Iâ€™d go.I think they’re using Komatsu from Japan...They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine who’s Chinese from China – very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay?And this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going – we’re going to have problems.And I agreed with him.I’m me.He did that.â€

And honestly, itâ€™s a very dangerous period in our country.No tough questions.Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work.We’re really in trouble.We love Sheriff Joe.Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home.I will tell you, when I saw that on Sean Hannity, I actually called him.Well, we’re going to start winning again.They were laughing at him in the streets of Iran.So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals.But there is another side.I want to go and vote."You know, they’re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know.I mean, what the hell did we get?And we have defeated ISIS, essentially, a very short while ago, in the Middle East.But, you know, I never did politics before.But weâ€™ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.You should stay there a little longer.OK?...I started off on 17th.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work â€“ rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.THE PRESIDENT:  You donâ€™t need it.He was at zero.We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.One’s brilliant because he wears glasses, you know?There are still things â€” excuse me â€” there are still things that people donâ€™t know.YOU KNOW, I WROTE A FEW WORDS TODAY.Both of them want TPP.You know, but they’re not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million.The smartest people call.We gave them $150 billion.We’re going to get rid of it.But I may just say, maybe we should get 10%, 15%, maybe 20% as that oil flows through our land.You know what happened on the West Side Highway.The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland.Itâ€™s called very simply: The American Model.Think of it.Weâ€™re working on a summit.Yes, they control them.Right?And he insulted Ben Carson by doing

thatâ€™s a flowchart.We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.Thank you.Why would you want to leave?And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country.By the way, think of the Iran deal for one second.We have borders or we don’t have borders.Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.The special interests will remain firmly in control.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.We get greedy, right?I turned him down.Doral, Turnberry in Scotland.That Iran deal was a disaster.We will make our cities safe again.I don’t know.These are bad dudes.Weâ€™ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.I’ve never met you."Hey, I’m rich.Is he going to vote for Obama?"So Hillary Clinton said — and here’s Chuck Todd — and he’s a nice guy.Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.Q    Itâ€™s me?I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to.They must think there’s a big event going happen today.You’ve got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us.So â€” and we need new wall.Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago.You can’t do that when you don’t have that.YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.It’s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs.Not only did I raise it, much of it was given a long time ago.Right?She's a corrupt person.I think it’s a much different kind of a process.But I don’t know.I think some people were disappointed that I didn’t go in the debate.And just so you understand – Ted Cruz – I don’t know if he likes me or if he doesn’t like me.Look at what happened in the 1990s.Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.I will say that.Cuban.I have unbelievably great relationships.So tonight folks, this was a great evening.They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel.When somebody’s down at zero I would think that eventually they’ll drop out.No jobs.But Marco came after me very viciously.(Applause.)We will make America wealthy again.And the 30th in the top 30 – we’re number 30th."Make America Great Again."Theyâ€™ll soar.They don’t know it’s strategy.I didnâ€™t do what Obama did:  Give them $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages.The press was going to look so closely.And weâ€™ll make it good, and we wonâ€™t be closing up our factories, and we wonâ€™t be losing our jobs.They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.In the old days, somebody would leave for, frankly, South Carolina.I’m going to stay here.I want to just thank a couple of friends of mine that are here, the owner of this incredible hotel, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin, stand up.He’s in favor of Common Core.And so, so important – common sense.In order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails.No more missiles going up.You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.Politicians prospered â€“ but the jobs left, and the factories closed.Iâ€™m well protected.It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.I can’t believe it....So the Super PACs are horrible and I had many set up for me by people I didn’t know.And weâ€™ll do it the way we have to do it.If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III, OK?And, by the way, at Little Haiti they presented me with something that I figured Iâ€™d put on.We can’t say, "Well, we’re going and attack on March 14th and then we’re going to hit them from the front and then we’re going to hit them from the back."We had an amazing team of talent.If you can’t pay your bills, honestly, there should be – they’ve got to go because we can’t do it.And you know, I don’t blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one.When they say they want to run against me, that means they don’t want to run against me, do you understand that?Not anymore.Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.They;re gone.I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons.Number one, they probably wouldnâ€™t have done it.And itâ€™s not my movement.You may have an unfriendly decision."He is nowhere.We do get along great with the Kurds.I said, â€œWhat a deal.â€  It took like a week.You know.Some of them are actually at 0% and 1%.But here’s the story.Right from the beginning.We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks.They couldn’t get it done.22 a day and a lot of people don’t even believe that number.Really big league.Well, if you look at the second place, people didn’t talk about my second place.It’s a disaster.Connecticut – now, Tom Brady loves me and that’s sort of like, you know, and I love Tom Brady by the way.I don’t know if you know or if you’ve heard me say we have the absolute worst – we spend number one in the world on education.I really don’t think that anybody is going to fall – he doesn’t talk.All to charity.Many books – bestsellers.I really appreciate it.I hate to hear it."Good, I got it.Jim Acosta.And then all of a sudden you didn’t hear so much about the plateau.She came on a fiancee permit...You know, wonderful fiancee.AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.Even our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we’re letting into America.Why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place?But theyâ€™re going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case.Dwight Eisenhower, nice guy, he moved 1.5 million people out of the United States.One of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it.Is there anything that can be said at this point tomorrow â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.Now, we’ve already taken off the sanctions.Itâ€™s almost like, in the meantime, we won.SO WHEN OUR ENEMIES LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR COUNTRY, THEY SEE OUR DEFICITS.In China, in the South China Sea, there were these low-level land masses that were covered by water, but pretty close to the top.Everything is Benghazi.And by ’17, meaning he’ll be playing golf and I’ll be working very hard.But I’m with you.Each side must give up something it values, I mean we have to do something where there’s value in exchange for something that it requires.He can stop things if they’re allowed to stop them.We got far less than nothing.I’m trying to be nice and I said, "Go back and write me a little note if you can."And if we can, thatâ€™s great.That’s the big leagues.I said, "What?BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO -- WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS.On the budget – I’m really good at these things – economy, budgets.I said, â€œWow, thatâ€™s the same story that the woman told me that I found hard to believe.â€  Because why would â€” how would anyone do that with 3 million people?The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured.It’s war.Our country is in serious trouble.And it takes courage to run.Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world.We’re going to replace it with something so much better and so much less expensive.He is a lightweight, as I’ve said many times before.THE PRESIDENT:  I agree.Iâ€™ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.But they said â€” one of them said, â€œBut Mr. President, nobody ever asked us for that.Now, I’m sure at some point, he’ll take it back.Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East.Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.But I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right?Then you look at her record as secretary of State.And they said, whatever you want is okay.We have great, great people.So the world is unpredictable.But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency.They want to get rid of it.She was two hours late.If Saudi Arabia didn’t have us for years protecting them, they would have been gone a long time ago as Saudi Arabia.Thank you.Because baby – you know, think of it.I lucked into it.It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism.We have an Army that the heads said is not prepared.What weâ€™re doing is if we made a deal with Canada â€” which is, you know, a good chance still.But youâ€™ve got to be at least a little bit fair.Look, I’m fighting some very nice people.That’s what they’re good at.7,000 people and in a confined space.Inspired by stories like Aliceâ€™s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the FIRST STEP Act into law.Remember it, folks.And in a way, that was almost a test.Guess what?Could they start?And I put in a hell of a lot of money.I think we’re actually doing better than the polls.Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past.And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet.I’m standing here, he’s over here.You just come in, use it, go back to the White House.(Applause.)I’d tell you this, look I’ll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back.I don’t have to give him a big speech.But they’re controlled by these people.He may have had some, I think, accusations made.But I think they should because there’s too many people.That’s not including the drugs.I became an outsider because I was running.But likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we’ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers.On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of American workers.And that would have been a shame.We need it more than ever.With that being said, I don’t really care.We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.Iâ€™ve had great support from Congress generally.As long as the GOP stands for â€œMade in the USA,â€ â€” remember in the old days, cars all said, â€œMade in the USA,â€ right?We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs.Okay?Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons.I don’t want to pay.They put whoever.We won ...Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on?Hello over there.We have states that are doing great.I negotiated it to hell.I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field.Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.You can keep your plan.Take a look at what's happening with — you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals.There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President.Because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, they’re taken off the roll.(Applause.)I get along great with Japan.We don’t want them to arm necessarily.They havenâ€™t gone up for a long time.And I mentioned illegal immigration.Said Donald Trump was very disappointed that it didn’t go from Jefferson to Lincoln.He said terrible things about her.I remember when Jeb and Hillary the same day — Mr. Trump’s tone is not nice.DO WE LOVE BOBBY KNIGHT.Iâ€™m the one that find them.You know, there’s a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment.For many, many years, for decades they’d fight, fight, fight.But the Art of the Deal – great success.The statue is cherished.They’re fed up with it and they’re fed up with those guys back there, the media.I don’t get bids from American.You have to read it.Thatâ€™s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.Itâ€™s fine.You know?The word, â€œreciprocityâ€ â€” they do it, we do it.THE PRESIDENT:  Great people.But you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan.They’re a fraud.Weâ€™re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.Excuse me.Now, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington.I’d love to – and I will give it.So we are going to try and usually when I say try that means I’m going to get it done.The judge has been very unfair.So when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually â€” in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank.So listen.We need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials.Do you ever hear that from government?Weâ€™ve been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China.Q    I think it would great if a female reporter would ask you a question about this issue.In fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore.I was against the war in Iraq.How about when they build a hospital and it costs $3 billion?Well, we’re going to try to get rid of that.We have to build up our military.You’re going to be very proud of me.But I do mean it.We’re going to protect the Second Amendment.They tried to convince people that I had something to do with Russia.I said, â€œWell, I think the two-state will happen.We’ll have to figure it out.They're all over the place.They say he's not perfect.And nobody is more conservative and we call toughness but nobody is more conservative on the Second Amendment.And weâ€™re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal.Okay, thank you all very much.It means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation.But they have bridges going up.And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem.And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life.But it wouldâ€™ve been nice to have gotten done.I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment.You know?AUDIENCE:  Booo â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Tonight, Iâ€™ll go home, Iâ€™ll turn on, Iâ€™ll say â€” listen, Iâ€™ll turn on that television.They don’t even know what the hell they are doing there, all the sudden, the cameras swerve and make perfect shots.My taxes will – first of all, I’ll have a much simpler tax statement.We’re now sending F-22s.But he is.Each of you has the power to change hearts, transform lives, and shape your countriesâ€™ destinies.People are offering me millions and millions of dollars.I have a friend who actually bought an airplane and he can’t get it into China because the tax is so massive.I hope I can watch.WE'RE GOING TO OWE -- RIGHT NOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?You don’t – nobody does.You didnâ€™t get healthcare â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, Iâ€™ll tell you.ABC.It will be much simpler.THE PRESIDENT:  I would talk about it.I’m the most conservative with the military.Everybody said, â€œWhat happened?â€  Well, whatâ€™s happening is growth.He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?Senator that calls me, we’ll send you a campaign contribution."With that being said, I look forward to what she has to say.We’re going to work really hard.It’s not like it’s terrible.They fight and they were equal militarily.I’m looking at the polling booths.I’m putting up my own money.It’s not 5.3%.We lost our jobs.We’re going to knock the hell out of them.â€œUSMCâ€ â€” which would be U.S., Mexico, Canada.And honestly, they do a great job, but they don’t produce as many as I’d like because, frankly, there’s a big — I mean, it’s amazing.We’re going to be terrific.My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen.Look, we have expanded the Republican Party.Itâ€™s very successful.Nobody’s going to mess with us.He’s not doing well.She actually said "They’d love you" but I don’t want to brag.He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.You have not been treated fairly.These are very new numbers.Okay?This is a very nice barn actually.THE PRESIDENT: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.He is a tough, smart guy.(Applause.)35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama.And I’m not saying that — I’ll tell you why.Iâ€™m playing with fairly expensive money.It’s really amazing.So we are doing great as a country.So that’s good.I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow?WE HAVE ISIS LOOKING AT US.My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations.Don’t forget, I didn’t want to go into Iraq.Here’s the way I look at it.It’s not going to happen with these people.We’ve lost our manufacturing.Mexico also took a big plant out of Tennessee and Tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn’t.THESE ARE PEOPLE FLYING THESE JETS NOW IN COMBAT.This is a movement.I said, â€œListen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country.Because, look, Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people.You wouldnâ€™t need all of this incredible talent.And I, frankly, think that â€” I think they like what the Republicans are doing, but I think they would have liked to have seen it go a lot faster.So weâ€™re streamlining the process, and we wonâ€™t be having so much of that anymore.Yes, I flew to Singapore.AND WE'LL HELP.And there was no way â€” there was no way of making a correct statement that early.Itâ€™s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our communities, and to hire our great American workers.Did you?What does it mean?Should you say how many years youâ€™ve been married?But when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I won’t mention names, some of them when they hear my name – I was talking – we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us.I mean, I don’t know.I guarantee no other person gave John Deere – I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments.Itâ€™s love.And to this day it’s one of the great buildings of the world and it’s one of the great successes.So before she knew she was on tape, she said "I was jolted backwards."Thank you, all.Thank you very much.We’ve got to stop the stupid.The Mexican Government wants an open border as long as it’s a ONE WAY open border into the United States.They used it on everybody.And it’s horrible.Okay.And some, I assume, are good people.And he’s very, very respected throughout the country but he’s very respected here.They tax us.So making the statement when I made it was excellent.This is serious rifle.And you know what?They will not.And he said, "Would you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire?"Oh, okay."They’re going to destroy a man’s life?As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is;
fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports.TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.So I think I solved it.But I think it’s actually going to be an election based on competence.He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe.The farmers are going to come out great.Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans – these are people that are here by the way, people that are here – 25% not 1%.So you can't have Jeb Bush.We can all understand the other side.YOU'RE REALLY SPECIAL PEOPLE.And actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built.A lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate.But when you’re talking about "Crippled America" and you’re talking about all of the problems we have, I can’t have a big smiley face up there.And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide.We’re going to get the Gulf states to pay for it because they should.I can be very, very current.Forget that one."By the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever.If it’s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it.And if you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal about Mitt Romney, he looks like a fool.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, weâ€™ll see.So you know there’s a movement to move Iowa to the back of the pack.Iâ€™m here today to represent the interests of the American people and to affirm Americaâ€™s friendship and partnership in building a better world.They get 14 plus seven so they’re getting 21 people.AUDIENCE:  USA!In the most dangerous world we’ve ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don’t know – they don’t – I’m telling you.Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up â€” and you see that, you see it all over â€” from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.I can settle that case.Because we’re down the line.A lot of pundits said "He’ll never run.That was 250,000 people.Theyâ€™re all men.So what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that I’m the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it’s a big problem.You’re out of job.WE'RE GOING BRING OUR MILITARY BACK.I mean, it’s been an interesting experience.She’s so smart.The bracket of 25% – the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all – they’ve been there for years – are antiquated in many cases.What theyâ€™ve done is unbelievable.The public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land, why are they here?Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.Got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with Bernie to be honest with you.Better hope I’m president.Some are unbelievable.They should have pushed it harder.Right?You know, a lot of people think I don’t like these people.That’s right, we don’t win anymore.We should have gotten those hostages before we started even negotiating.You look at Rex Tillerson â€” heâ€™s out there negotiating right now.There is nothing I would rather do than stop referring to your party as the Do-Nothing Democrats.Just look what he did with Ben Carson.I mean, whoever is representing Iran is doing a hell of a job.I said "Because I’m special."I said – I used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make…Can we think of any deals?But we will make America great again, I promise.But the silent majority is more than Tea Party....Well, Merkel got it.The Republicans want the money to come back.Because who’s going to get the oil?Over here – boom."But ’17 instead you’re not getting the people signed up.Just take a look at that.To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.Q Doesnâ€™t that undermine â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Very fake news now.I wanted to keep it private.They had 200 people.I’ve done so well in this country.I think Iâ€™ll say a few words, and then weâ€™ll take some questions.And you know what a disaster that is.They come in – "We want deal."Everybody wanted it.IT WILL END, FOLKS.Somebody said it’s a barn.Youâ€™re not the only one, so donâ€™t feel badly.Weâ€™re going to renegotiate NAFTA.And that’s how – I mean, whether people like it or not that’s how we assimilate and that’s how we go on to that next phase and that next stage.WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO IT.No.This is going to be high wall.You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?And I know they’ll say, "Well, we have nothing to do.Wow, what a crowd.You’re going to say, "Please, tell him to get out of here.They couldn’t believe it.I would not increase the tariffs.And I think it’s going to be very interesting.You know, it’s very hard.Now, I think I think I average about three or four a day, right?You see the polls.No, no, no.DON'T EVEN TELL ME ABOUT IT.They can’t get their money back.Way, way down.AND I SAID VERY SIMPLE.You do — you do $100 bills, you would fill the room to the ceiling, $500 billion deficit — trade deficit with China.Okay, one more.â€œHe should be put in the electric chair.â€ You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?But weâ€™re going to be beneficiaries from now on.And he said, "Oh, that’s okay."In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges.I’m here today to tell you that we have to change.They’re going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things.I want to see.So nice, thank you very much.Not even discussed.We’re going to save your Social Security.You know the friends we’re talking about.Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing?(Applause.)Q    Iâ€™m just going to â€” okay.We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.They can’t make a deal.You have to be...Hundreds – hundreds of requests and she doesn’t respond.IT'S A DISGRACE.Weâ€™re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so weâ€™ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that.I mean, sometimes â€” sometimes somebody gets â€”

Q (Off mic.)If it’s cold, it’s okay.They can’t – they lose the argument but they never change their mind.Elvin says that, â€œIf I can make sure these young girls get their justice, Iâ€™ve [really] done my job.â€  Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.Remember.I’m truly honored by your support.So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.These are the conservative solutions we campaigned on, and these are the conservative solutions the American people asked us as a group to deliver.Bill, good luck.Now, we have to do it.(Applause.)I want them back.It’s about doing the right thing.And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.I think you’re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.I think maybe he’s [Joe Biden] inclined not to get in the race.And you see that happening all the time.But think of it; think of it.I think maybe thereâ€™s no more important point.You know, not everybody could be like us.I REALLY MEAN IT.Itâ€™ll come out.(Applause.)I promise I will defend you from profiling.These people – and you know I have arguments with them all the time and I’m a practical guy.They’re getting money from everybody.Q    Thatâ€™s perfectly well.And now we’re going to Nebraska where I have – I just hear we’re doing really wonderfully.Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire.Honestly, I did, I always liked him but he became — you know, somebody told him you’re losing very badly.They make our countries great.It’s disgusting.I’m going to do that.THE PRESIDENT: I looked â€” you know, I looked at that name.We have great relationships with many foreign countries.They’re all taken care of by the special interests.Look, again, I’m doing this.I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.She’s 92 years old.We have to save our country.And it came out that way â€” and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.LOOK, HERE IS THE STORY.They all go "heh, heh, heh."And most importantly, this is wrong.He said you have a great quarterback.Somebody said the other day, "What’s the first thing you’re going to do?"So we write about it in the book.Don’t watch it.Iâ€™ve always said women are smarter than men.To save taxpayer dollars, Iâ€™ve already begun negotiating better contracts for the federal government â€” saving over $700 million on just one set of airplanes of which there are many sets.No interest," because I don’t need anybody’s money.I must be honest with you, weâ€™re not getting along at all with their negotiators.Anybody in this room 112 or over?You and others on your committees have long said impeachment must be bipartisanâ€”it is not.We wouldnâ€™t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.We lose with trade.Thank you ...I’m telling you.He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.But above all, we are together and we are Americans.Yesterday I went up to Ohio.He is not a racist, I can tell you that.No, I didnâ€™t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didnâ€™t do it, okay?When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured.I want to build a wall.You want to know the truth.In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.Marco Rubio’s personal finances are discredit…All you have to do is look at his credit card.(Applause.)Sky News.I have no obligation.Let them come into the country, we don’t have guns.I think we’re actually going to even do better.I think it’s a total fringe deal.On the debates, it’s very interesting.DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.We have to have a strong military.The senators are very capable people.But they short â€” itâ€™s a con job by the Democrats.You’d sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button.The Senate subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.(Laughter.)They don’t like it.THAT I CAN TELL YOU.America is a cutting-edge economy, but our immigration system is stuck in the past.And I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable – you didn’t hear a thing about it.Right?Should we continue for a little while?America is a nation that believes in redemption.AND WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF TRADE?When a bomb is this long, can’t put too many of them together for a bathroom, right?We can turn it all around – and we can turn it around fast.We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world â€” all across the world.The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn’t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States.And itâ€™s totally unacceptable....There’s such spirit...There’s such spirit no matter where I go.Folks, that's going to stop.It’s really an act of defense.It was pretty disgraceful.Do you ever notice?I said when did that happen exactly?They’re good with the mouth but they’re not good with the brain.Give me a break.First of all, we’re going to do great with the African- Americans, and you see that in the polls where I had in one poll where I’m 25 percent.He's better than a consultant.I will tell you this: Nobody’s putting up millions of dollars for me.We have infrastructure that we have to fix.It’s not because they were afraid.Well, we need somebody with that...And it’s America first, folks.By the way, these are out of books.Thank you very much everybody.WE'RE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.And if the news would have reported these four people â€” I couldnâ€™t believe it.But he was screaming at me.But I just love you.Time will tell.That happens with endorsements.I mean, we’re just winning so much.I love the people of Iowa.We set a record – a big record.Bob Dole endorsed me.If I told Carl, Carl, watch over China trade, we’re going to be in great shape.Today I heard it.The stock market is setting records.You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President.If she doesnâ€™t do it, you just canâ€™t do this anymore, with the obstruction and the obstructionists.So that can go out to 20 years....They say "The young married couple".True.That is why the foundation of our job creation agenda is to fundamentally reform our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years.Maryland just came out.There was no collusion.And then you had the killing of Kate [Steinle] and the killing of Jamiel and the killing recently in California of a 66-year-old – think of it, 66-year-old – veteran, female, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant.I don’t really sort of want to wait.The number is probably $2.5 trillion.Q (Inaudible.)I think heâ€™s friend.You see Bloomberg is somebody that wants to knock out the Second Amendment.So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I’ll do.Heâ€™s kept his promise.But one of the very smart one says "If Trump wins Iowa, it’s over."They just kept coming and coming.They’re sending us not the right people.The best in the world.But in the end, it’s really about results.Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast."They have to be good to us, no longer one way.They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably weâ€™ve ever had before.Iâ€™m talking the existing law is very rough.The next day or a day later, they were incensed.Iâ€™m going to see whatâ€™s said.Second is terrible to me.I do that because that’s the kind of thinking our country needs right now.That commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time.We are going to win.I’m a job machine.Then he’ll call all sorts of political people, and I’ll say, "Sorry, fellas.She will write – so – it’s such misrepresentation.So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship â€” the Russian ship, as an example â€” Iâ€™m not going to tell you.It’s going in and that’s going to be it, going into Tennessee.And then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren’t paying taxes and all of this stuff, right?And you know, it’s a big industry here.We are keeping our promises.I will immediately terminate President Obama’s illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN AT SOME OF THE ARENAS.The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away.He wasn’t born.How do they do it?And we’re giving the award.They didn’t order Boeing.So we very nicely – and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk.But I donâ€™t blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China’s disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible agreement.Take their guns away.Iâ€™ve won seven out of seven.My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.Weâ€™re opening up for a lot of different groups.Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.And we don’t get reimbursement.You see whatâ€™s happening.Okay, dying.When we can.They know it’s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.If you look at Merck as an example, take a look where â€” excuse me, excuse me â€” take a look at where their product is made.I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE WALL IS GOING TO BE REALLY HIGH, BUT THAT IS REALLY HIGH UP THERE.We have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart.That’s the end of it.We’re never going to have to use it.Boy, look at the press back there.We need strength.The polls have been incredible.I gave great credit to Iran, to Russia, and to Syria for not doing it.But we’re going to come very close.So each agency is accountable.And I go around and I’ve seen the principals.We’re going to make America great again.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I donâ€™t know.I don’t understand it.We have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be – the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know.To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you.Should have never happened.The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.They’ve done an incredible job and everybody goes through Liberty.We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.STARTED BY A MANIAC THAT SOME PEOPLE ASKED FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR HIM.THEY'RE MAKING PLENTY OF MONEY.And they said, "This happens all the time."You look good and tough.And a lot of times, I’ll say, "How can a deal be so stupidly made?Now, Manafort has totally denied it.It was a defective deal.And create a new American future.We also have a lot of smart people here.We’ll be filing it right on time....I always say I’m just a common sense conservative.TRUMP: It also means we must change our foreign policy.We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan.I think he’s a fringe candidate if you want to know the truth.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.I mean, these were real people.I don’t think I’ve ever said that in my life.THEY KNOW A HELL OF A LOT OF BETTER THAN CONSULTANTS AND PEOPLE MAKING A MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT DON'T HAVE A CLUE.Iâ€™ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and weâ€™re â€” Iâ€™ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.You know, I went to a great school.What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew?He buys Caterpillar tractors all the time and excavators.Okay?And I’ve just gotten to see it.BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR.They understand it.I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan.Unless they have bad intentions which I don’t believe they do.Not going to happen that way.THE PRESIDENT:  I thought that the statement put out â€” the motherâ€™s statement I thought was a beautiful statement.(Applause.)Now, the people in charge say things can’t change.What?Weâ€™re speaking â€” maybe we shouldnâ€™t be doing this, you know?AND I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE TONIGHT IN THE AUDIENCE.Think of it.And now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies – very large, very prestigious companies as you know – obviously you know something about business.Very simple.Our theme is very simple.We are run by people that are incompetent.And when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-Israel, very – I mean, they love Israel.And we should do a safe zone over there.We are going to deal with DACA with heart.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.When I’m up on the stage with them, they think I’m crazy when I say "Mexico" — I’m saying, "We’re going to build a wall; it’s going to be a great wall; it’s going to be real wall.No, it’s true.They’re from China.Itâ€™s gone.Iâ€™ll be back.They’re incredible.AND I COULD SEE IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING.It’s true.This is an incredible â€” this is a historic letter.â€  And it is a historic letter.And we will see what happen (sic).I’ve made many deals with China.They’ll write about me every once in a while; every two years I’ll have a story, "Trump ran this rather good campaign."Great people.I know it was a very tough night for Marco Rubio.And so I don’t care.And they take our jobs and a lot of other things.And this is what we have to live with.…It’s true.So, the ad is him asking the question and I’m standing there like this, because I haven’t — in fact, you see in one of them, I’m just about ready to open my mouth.It’s getting ridiculous.Nobody is really – we have the ethanol – where are the ethanol people?I’m becoming diplomatic.You know, when I like people I like them.Thank you.But if I didn’t bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that we’re talking about and it happens to be a very important subject.LG.Thatâ€™s not a bad idea.Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities – all of our communities.Just remember.Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.Got to get the healthcare done.You know.That’s why the hat is so successful.We need tough.And interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I’ve been proven right.Let me list to you some of the things that weâ€™ve done in just a short period of time.By far.To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you.At a certain point, the people are going to say, â€œNo, thank you.â€  This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.We get the drugs.Yes, I vote."Thank you very much.[Build that wall chant]

Whoâ€™s going to pay for the wall?I didn’t know who Trace was.We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.Great people, great country.I might like $4 or $5 million.Theyâ€™ve spread like cancer.We’re going to create jobs like you’ve never seen.You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way.And just today, you said, you wouldnâ€™t â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Well, there is a truth.No more.Am I supposed to dislike them?Q    â€” on denuclearization.Why didnâ€™t we take care of Syria and other?Now I’ve known Syracuse and I’ve known Poughkeepsie and I’ve known all of the different places that I visited in New York and then Pennsylvania and then Maryland, which treated me so great the people are incredible.I’ll let him use it free.I hated some of the things.It poured the minute my speech – that’s like luck.And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business.I wrote down some notes...and it’s like devastating.THE PRESIDENT:  You have an infrastructure â€”

Q    What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill?Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth thatâ€™s parked overseas.Q    â€” that could cause you to withdraw the nomination?And they leave â€” everyone leaves.We shouldn’t have been in Iraq in the first place.Look, we’ve got to be tough, we’ve got to be smart, we’ve got to have heart too.Now, you mention the person, Marco, good guy.Three.Q President Trump, since you brought up Russia, Iâ€™m looking for some clarification here.We can’t win with the military.Once we get all of this finished, I’m going to go after one person, that’s Hillary Clinton, on the assumption she’s allowed to run, which is a big assumption.2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.I’m not controlled by lobbyists.Now, why would we put a guy like Jeb, like some of the others.Thank you very much everybody.No good.But Paul Manafort, whoâ€™s a good man also, by the way â€” Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.You know, they’re the ones that made the decision.And they said, "What would you do?"And we’ve had some great numbers coming out of Texas, and amazing numbers coming out of Tennessee and Georgia and Arkansas and then in a couple of weeks later Florida.Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns.You got to build new plants in our country.We need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect....I had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had.I received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal, but that’s OK. (inaudible) a couple of them, right?WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA.Nothing."We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things.But we collect it now.They take them off the statistics.They’re politicians, they’re all talk, they’re no action.I canâ€™t say â€” because you would say Iâ€™m too braggadocios â€” but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing.And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike.And then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside.And I said, â€œI think the two-state will happen.But we need Patton.Yes, go ahead.And theyâ€™re going to love it.You know, big letters.You know, I really do.Let me ask you this:  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?Who would have thought we have over 5,000 people cannot get in.It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.You know?AND NOW IT IS LIKE, REALLY, THAT IS GOOD, THAT IS ALL RIGHT.It’s no longer a silent majority.But first, I have to straighten out the military.Mexico $58 billion.…The wall is a big factor.Iâ€™d just tell you this: I think sheâ€™s going to be a fantastic First Lady.* * * *

Q    Will you go to Charlottesville?I know whatâ€™s bad.It was like 45 minutes.Thatâ€™s okay.We will make America safe again.This is some turnout.No, it’s sad.I brought it.Don’t worry about it.You’re not going to be there illegally.They want great jobs with good pay, and when they have that, you watch how race relations will be.You know, I call it a â€œwitch hunt.â€  And it is a witch hunt.(Applause.)CAN YOU IMAGINE, HEADLINES TOMORROW.Then, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.I watched New Yorkers rebuild the World Trade Center.We don’t want to be bad people.They’re all live — look at all those live cameras.Just one after another.Why are they going to make it?I supported him.Made in America.I never thought we were going to raise $1 million when we started.And so Alex, Iâ€™ve wished him the best.And then, somebody else came up.It’s not their thing.SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT, ALMOST 5,000 KILLINGS IN CHICAGO.Okay, how about one â€” go ahead.I’ve seen friends of mine go bankrupt.It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.But did you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia?THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.I order televisions because I have a lot of stuff and I like nice brand new — they’re all made in South Korea, most — other than Sony, and Sony, in all fairness, has lost its way.And we will â€” weâ€™ll be meeting in Hanoi.They’re going to be back, I guarantee you.But if we had a couple of – few of the people that I pointed out – I could plenty in this audience, believe me.They didn’t talk about the emails.That’s even better.We don’t win anymore.But these people are waiting four, five days.(Applause.)Because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions.It’s a noisy majority.No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.I said where are they?You have people who can’t get their money back into the country because the politicians can’t get along.WE'RE LIKE A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE AT THE BORDERS.And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country.We rent military bases.Weâ€™re going to make it much better than it is right now.So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border.And we’re going to have a President who’s respected by Putin, who’s respected by Iran.My administration has acted decisively to confront the worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag.And they do it with guile.They’re not supposed to be coordination.We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.This will be less than two years for a highway.And I said, "Why?"...Well, look he’s [referring to Cruz] from Texas.Thank you all for being here.Does that make sense by the way?I had Gov.It's incompetent.And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whoâ€™s totally taken advantage of our previous administration.No deal.When you see these things where they’re building a bridge and it’s going to cost, you know, $1 billion and it costs $12 billion.So, they asked be about that.Iâ€™m not ranting and raving.Now, think of it.THEY SEND IT BACK.It’s like a movement.Believe me.It’s a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisions...or looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent.I saw the press – "The young married couple that did the shooting".I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates – enormous profits – by the way beyond anything they’ve ever envisioned.Itâ€™s wrong.We did a thing yesterday at the speech.Some time I think I’m going to put in some false protesters.From 1947 to 2001 – a span of over five decades – our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%.One hundred percent.The worst things and they’re calling now and they’re calling us all and they’re saying, "We’d love to get on the train" – the "Trump Train" they call it – "But we’d love to get on the team."Nobody ever heard of an executive order.Letâ€™s go.We have a lot more people.But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.We Are Going To Make America Great Again For Everyone – Greater Than Ever Before.We’re not abolishing like other people.But Texas is out.We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment.Look at this.They have wires that are no good.We went up two points in the last poll, and we continue to go up.The head of the Harvard Law School, one of the top people in the business in terms of Constitution, is saying that, you know, he’s wrong.We got $18 trillion in debt.We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there â€” Hispanic American people.Isn't he a great guy.We are thirty miles from Steel City.And they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently.We couldn’t do it because, just like I said for the law.Thank you, and God bless you all.We want them to use American steel.I was sitting there thinking "Did he really say that?"Why didn’t they ask about all of the different things.And I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about.And they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls.I don’t know.(Laughter.)You’re going to be okay.Because if you don’t, it’s not going to happen.You know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment.We will make America strong again.We spent $2 trillion, and that was as a year and a half ago.We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus.You know him, right?And honestly, it’s going to be hard.If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I don’t think it’s anybody’s business if I want to send money to the vets.We’re going to give you the names right now, which is what you want.And NBC renewed the Apprentice.And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.We used to win.I want to use not too many executive orders folks.BUT WE ARE GOING TO TREAT OUR POLICE WITH RESPECT.You saw it in San Bernardino.Amazing country.Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views or values.No.As an example, Saudi Arabia.Really do.No, no, wouldn’t it be nice?Now, you have Rubio – nice guy, by the way.You know what Sharia is.I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.You think their kids don’t know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the World Trade Center?Right on Penn.--  The  Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama.And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.You’ll find out what he said.Thank you.And by the way, I think you do a very good job, but I didnâ€™t say that.He was working very hard and he loves you.And it’s a disaster what’s going on in our country.Both of them.This guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent.Take it nice and easy.I don’t have to be treated any differently than anybody else.But Iâ€™d rather do it much faster.Thank you.I’ll just tell you, watch – "Trump disappears!"But what they do is they smear opponents â€” and you look at her history â€” and they question policies.Now Iâ€™m talking about serious stuff.Okay?Weâ€™re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didnâ€™t like giving, previous to this administration.Look at what we did in Iraq.AND MIKE WILL COME TO SEE ME.But we have to do something about it and we are going to.Alex Acosta.We’re going to use our best people.And Jerry to top it off has taken it to a whole new place.We don’t want World Trade Centers.Iâ€™ve seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved.The world has blown up around Barack Obama.But he said very nice things.We’re like a bunch of dummies.Weâ€™re going to win.But now I’m going to take for the United States.And if they’re not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we’re going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals.Now, if you noticed a couple have dropped out.About eminent domain.But the truth is that it stopped immediately.These are strong people.Weâ€™ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.Can you imagine Gen. MacArthur or Gen. George Patton?But we also have some really bad gang members.The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours.I want to thank my entire family, including Maryanne, Elizabeth, Robert.IT'S SO IMPORTANT.So, it’ll change.(Applause.)Your Speakership and your party are held hostage by your most deranged and radical representatives of the far left.You know what Kerry said â€” the reason?Itâ€™s a privilege to be here at this forum where leaders in business, science, art, diplomacy, and world affairs have gathered for many, many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity, security, and peace.HE DESERTED.You take a look.His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views.Other businesses â€” even classic American brands â€” switched their headquarters to foreign countries.It’s a movement of common sense.Very liberal paper but that’s okay.(Applause.)I want low taxes.We love our country.I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for every one new regulation.The only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester.He’s got to be for oil, right?VERY IMPORTANT.This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany.I looked at the biggest boats you’ve ever seen.I want to use a nice word because otherwise they’d get reported for foul language.So here is Obama, gives an exact date.But we are far more Christians than we have men or women.Because I don’t really care that much.They go out.Special, special person.YOU GET IT.My goal is always again to bring people together.But I’ve had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.We're going to do the wall and by the way, who's going to pay for the wall?Third rate reporter.I didn’t need to do it.Okay.Newt Gingrich was on a television show the other say, and said, "This is one the great phenomenons (ph) I’ve ever seen in politics; nobody’s ever seen it."But they say, "He’ll never file.He likes that.He’s always got advice, right Steve?AND I PUT UP MILLIONS.We are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they're told to have by senators and congressmen in Washington.Thank you.So we must â€” we have no choice â€” we must lower our taxes.(Applause.)Finally.To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs.He knew.Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.You have to be able to lead.The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States.Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates.Come on up.She’s got her husband and her son and her son is absolutely magnificent and she loves him more than anything that you can imagine.And then Walker was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying "Make America great again" because he saw the response that I got.Now, we’re going to keep things going and we’re going to keep things going very nicely but we owe – soon – $21 trillion.And the word again eventually is going to come off.And we made a deal â€” paid â€” like, in a short period of time.We should seek common ground based on shared interests.He’s at zero.Thank you very much.And I say it, in the old days, they’d leave New York.There are a lot of times â€” well, thatâ€™s creating precedent.WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS, MAYBE THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD AND WE DON'T USE THEM.It’s going to be big and strong and powerful and nobody’s going to mess with us and it’s the cheapest thing we can do, I’ll tell you that right now.I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, weâ€™re going to lower taxes.I have been disappointed with some.Look, look, look, I’m the one that says though I don’t want to say everything.And the reason I can say that is I'm self-funding my campaign.Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton.And she looks magnificent.Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.It’s been amazing, the relationship.Okay.Not going to happen.Weâ€™re going to show them.When I have 25% or 26% and they have 1% but you people don’t mention that.But a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia.I mean, you’re in the crazy world of politics.McMaster, against these attacks.Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama.So we’re going to stop all this stuff.And Ryan is looking down, right now â€” you know that â€” and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.Weâ€™re not going to let it happen anymore.The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.Islamophobe.As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton “Voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.”
Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back.Well, I don’t want them.I mean, give me a break.Iâ€™ve done nothing for Russia.They were rigged.That’s what happens.You bet...You do.The biggest excavation.‘Take me in, oh tender woman.(Applause.)In short, the agreement doesnâ€™t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.They wouldn’t even be talking about it.Remember that heat?Believe me.And he just doesn’t have the energy.I don’t think Marco is going to be able to beat her.But if they don’t, it’s not so bad if they are at heads.THAT IS WHY I LOVE MY PROTESTERS.We are going to help your country.Take me in, oh tender woman,’ sighed the broken snake.Itâ€™s largely broken up.Now, Merkel, what did she do?I’ve got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, I’ll tell you that.It’s a magic act.Theyâ€™re doing it for other people.You know, I’ve spent tens of millions of dollars.AMAZING GUY.But it’s true.That’s what they call us because of our leaders.WE'RE WINNING TOO MUCH.They are using veterans as political pawns.You people have sort of seen because I’ve been a counter-puncher.Hey, five months ago, I was with you.Okay.I don’t know.Think about it.And everybody sees it everyday.Our country can be great again.You go to the SCC."We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa.We have no idea what’s going on.And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press.I’m loyal.I said, "What do you mean?"They’re leaving our shores to go and collect their money.How about the area — you know, the big area?Nobody does anything about it.But mostly false, I have to be honest.Same thing with China.A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.Probably mostly back there in the press.THE PRESIDENT: They all happened recently, and I understand what theyâ€™re doing, because theyâ€™re doing the same thing.LOOK AT THIS THING.They’re going to respect us.And American energy mined from American sources will power our energy.$2.5 trillion – that’s out of the country that these companies can’t get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high.So everyone says, you have the right temperament – I have a great temperament.We forget about him.Iowa.It didn’t happen.You look at the – no, except with the Republicans.And I told — the other night, I said and a friend of mine, very, very successful guy who I would love to have negotiating against China.Carl Icahn, who’s a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he — it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where we’re losing companies.I said, â€œWeâ€™re defending you.Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building.Senator [Marco] Rubio is a lightweight.What’s not nice?Or theyâ€™re doing it surgically, at least.So, here’s a couple of stories happened recently.Because Medicare does work.No, we won’t do that."If you look at China, if you look at Japan – I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago.(Applause.)I want a lot of things.It’s a double taxation.In fact, Hillary Clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life.You’re going to see.What we’re going to do is we’re going to save Medicare.Right?An endorsement from your group with so many veterans – hundreds of thousands of veterans – I really appreciate that, Joe.He forgot to announce it on his personal financial disclosure form.Youâ€™re already seeing whatâ€™s going on.An incredible husband.This week I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality child care for their children.I HEAR WE'RE LEADING IN OHIO.They’re great people.People had a good time with me.THE PRESIDENT:  Good.So we are going to turn things around.The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election.You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.I go to Florida and look at the numbers that just came out in Florida.I believe — we’ve got to be smart.That’s what I do.So I just want to thank you all, and all those that are pouring billions of dollars into our country, or ten dollars into our country, we thank you very much.Let me tell you about Mitt Romney.And walls do work.Was it a line?And I must say in staying in various places in Indiana, I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads, negative one after another after another.But the fact is right now, we’re going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates.One person.Iâ€™m going to fix it.He took on Trump, he took on Trump.Thank you.Try doing that sometime.But then the polls came out and some of them – as an example – national polls 38% for Trump, 20% for second.I want people to come through.NOW WE NEVER WIN.The last thing she wants in her whole life is — this was only — I did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband’s one of the great abusers of the world?We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.You get one.I said, "Heroin?"Right?They are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and weâ€™re going to stop it.And if you wanted to do that in Mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country.We actually have a very good relationship together â€” a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations.What would you do about ISIS?"THE PRESIDENT: Okay.Wouldn’t that be great if this were the country doing this?"God will get angry at me, right?They go around the wall and in.The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place.I said, "That’s right, Mark.Come here.THE PRESIDENT:  As I said on â€” remember, Saturday â€” we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.How will we be remembered?60%, 70%.I said, but Mexico?Believe me.Okay?And nobody else could do it.â€  You know, I mean, youâ€™ll take a look.Two hours primetime.Somebody.Big ones in New York and one in San Francisco – Bank of America – that I have in partnership with a great company.He said we want to win.So I would say, "Congratulations.This has been an amazing evening.We’re going to win so much you’re all going to get sick and tired of winning.So I think we're going to do very, very well.Here’s the story.He said, "We’re going in next week."Can you imagine I got the approval?Now, it’s very interesting.So itâ€™s going to get better and better.No intelligent person believes what you are saying.BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT IS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.This ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall I’m talking about."We love that."Weâ€™re going to grow; weâ€™re going to grow rapidly.Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party.Nah, he’s been nice.You are not just after me, as President, you are after the entire Republican Party.We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency.Melania is terrific.I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.And I had this time â€” weâ€™ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible.Well, we’re looking at a 3% but we think it can be 5%, it could even be 6%.I may never see it again.It was Sharon.But we have 9 months, 10 months to go.Yeah, I look forward to it.I want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again.Q    New York Times?THESE ARE AMATEURS.There was no obstruction â€” I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back.But they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the Interpol.And now they're going to Texas and they're going all over.I wanted to show people.That’s so important.It all doesn’t work.First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam.In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense.I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, â€œThe whole concept of executive order, itâ€™s not the way the country is supposed to be run.â€  You said, â€œYouâ€™re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal.â€  Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal youâ€™re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?and Mrs. Steve Wynn.I have all of these people.Everyone goes crazy.You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where I’m leading big.And people, the politicians are saying, "How can you possibly get them to pay?"The 14th Amendment.He said, â€œOh, what did I get it for?â€  With me, I probably will never get it.I kill.And Iâ€™m saying, whatâ€™s going to happen when Iâ€™m dealing on the Middle East?Those days don’t exist anymore.So together we'll make America great again.Iâ€™ve been telling the people in Ohio for five years that this is happening.And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.You never have a businessman.From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.Everybody wants to build our wall.Now, when they — if they turn negative, I don’t like them.Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great.It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico.And we had, I believe, 58 Muslim countries â€” the leaders.Weâ€™re going to win it.They have all these PACs.Thank you.I said, "No, they’re not actually that dumb.And the worst example of it – one of the worst example of it – is the phony unemployment rate.You look at what’s happening in Phoenix and different places throughout the country where they’re catching people stealing and they don’t even fire them, where people are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line.THEY ARE CHOPPING HEADS OFF OF CHRISTIANS AND EVERYBODY ELSE.And they’re taking our money and, you know, you talk about the imbalance of trade, you talk about the kind of money.You can’t make the speech over and over…
The other candidates don’t get covered live ever, except for the debate.Clinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country.Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.There is so much waste in government and I believe when I get in there I’ll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the – and we’re not even showing anything for that.And one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there – I showed some of the developments that – I have many, many more because you can only – Simon and Schuster – you actually kept me to eight or nine pages.So is — by the way, I’m the only one self-funding my campaign.More than we were even requesting.CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I THREW OUT THE F-BOMB.They have bridges that are so incredible you’ve never seen anything like it.And I will tell you I’m going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it’s so important.The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest.NOW THEY ARE SO RICH, THEY ARE BUYING AIRLINERS, THEY ARE BUYING EVERYTHING.Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.Good morning.Weâ€™re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.We are getting rid of common core.But they donâ€™t believe you.You can’t be the number one person that doesn’t vote in the Senate.I think the way he got out was great.Thank you very much.He’s weak on immigration.Iâ€™m nothing more than a messenger.It would be great if that deal could be made.Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.THE PRESIDENT:  I think that we are able to â€” and maybe heâ€™s not anymore.And if they did, Lyin’ Ted, lyin’, he comes up.They’re not a young married couple.Radical Islamic terrorism.REMEMBER AND I TOLD THIS STORY A COUPLE OF TIMES.There's nothing easy about running for president, I can tell you.And almost 100 pages.And tonight, I see that I won with the evangelicals.Q    Is it okay if I give it to the New York Times, Mr. President?BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY REPRESENTING YOUR EMPLOYEES, YOUR COMPANY AND YOUR FAMILY.We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.Thank you.Now, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right?The fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders.Weâ€™re going to do great things.Yes.Chris Christie endorsed me.And recently, he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because they’ve cut the yen.But we have to rebuild our country.I wouldn’t even names.Weâ€™re getting rid of all of those regulations on business.But why are we leading the fight?I mean, look at this.But the Tea Party has tremendous power.You know, there’s 15 of us.Letâ€™s go, captain.Thereâ€™s no reason why we shouldnâ€™t.Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven’t seen in a long time.As I promised during the campaign, I have proposed a budget that eliminates the defense sequester and fully rebuilds the United States military.Q    â€” and your backers.Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair.I salute the incredible skill and courage of Americaâ€™s men and women in uniform.My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON TRADE.Does anybody in this room really believe that?And their equipment is old.I want to help people.No, no, you won’t have any golf anymore.But he was a Senator from Texas.You’re talking about potentially thousands of companies.But the election that I’m watching is the election for the presidency of the United States.And I put out on social media and elsewhere â€” I gave Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, everybody these orders: â€œDonâ€™t let it happen.â€  I said, â€œDonâ€™t let it happen.â€  That doesnâ€™t mean they canâ€™t be selective.And by the way, outside you have a few people picketing.They take our jobs.Under that standard, every American president would have been impeached many times over.THEY HAVE HIGHWAYS THAT WE CAN ONLY DREAM ABOUT.He didn’t know.You have problems like nobody has.First of all, people aren’t going to his rallies anymore.We have to do it."Donald I think you should do this and that."So easy.WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?Oh.God bless you.Everybody saw this, and Iâ€™m saying â€” the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information thatâ€™s classified?Tom Brady’s a friend of mine.And Iâ€™m reading the order, Iâ€™m saying, why arenâ€™t we using American steel?The press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall.And I asked the people â€” many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.It’s the same.The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the â€œabandonment of the protective policy by the American governmentâ€¦ will produce want and ruin among our people.â€  Lincoln was right â€” and itâ€™s time we heeded his advice and his words.They gave up.And it’s got to stop.The whole top center front page of the New York Times.YOU LEAVE, YOU KEEP THE OIL.As you know, China has – it’s probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us.Theyâ€™re in the process of breaking up.Most of them say, "You can’t build a wall — build a wall."…Now, number one, they look bad because they said – do you remember the beginning?Believe me, they didnâ€™t come from me.Weâ€™ll build a wall.He did the voter violation form.People agree with what we've — they want the wall.We don’t win with the military.Everybody wants to be a federal judge.SO KNOWING THAT, THE FACT THEY HAVE A COLONEL AND I BELIEVE A GENERAL TALKING TO THE PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM, AND THEY TOLD THE COLONEL AND THE GENERAL THAT HE LEFT.And you’re going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the United States?But when you look at the things that are happening with our country – the trade situation with not just China – I talk about China all the time because that’s the main abuser, that’s the biggest abuser.This is a group thatâ€™s been so special to me.That’s an easy one.WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET ELECTED WHO HAVE A RIGGED SYSTEM AND WHO HAVE REALLY RIGGED THE SYSTEM TO A LARGE EXTENT.Now, we’re going to have to do it."It’s called you get out.We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things.They’re chopping off Christians’ heads in Syria and other places and they want me to have a nice tone.Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as President of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers.We’re going to win."(Applause.)The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.I believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems.I’m impressed actually.There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything.No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.Don’t worry about it.WHAT THE HELL -- DO YOU HAVE TO -- NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEM MAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.I see it.(Applause.)When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing.They’re contributing to every candidate but Trump.He just wants to attack everything.I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true.They've taken our jobs, they've taken our money, they've taken everything.These security actions will save billions of dollars, millions of jobs, and thousands and thousands of lives.And what happens?It’s natural.But it was really – I said, "That’s not nice what he said."Folks, it’s so unfair.What you just said...what about Ukraine?Who got it?Thank you very much, Grace.Why shouldn’t I?Remember?I think they said, 79 cents on the dollar.Think of that.I’ll talk to you.Won other polls.Something that how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands.And I have to thank Bobby Knight.Iâ€™m against what they want to do.But hereâ€™s the thing:  They have rampant inflation.Right?Q    Why?We’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again.We got not one vote to try and fix healthcare and get rid of Obamacare.Thank you very much.And some sent me $1,000.He loves Israel.The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together.Not just a Supreme Court judge, Iâ€™m talking about court of appeals; Iâ€™m talking about district court.They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group.But weâ€™re going to â€” hey look, Nov. 8 you go and vote.It’s true.I think they do.We don't win with the military, we can't beat ISIS.That’s hard to do.THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.Now you know sheâ€™s very much against the Second Amendment.As much as I like being with you tonight.To win by that kind of a number is incredible.I get along with everybody.I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world.I say, why is he doing this?THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP.No, sir.And then what happened â€” it was funny â€” they said, â€œHe was terrible.I buy those air conditioners – a lot of them.Carl Icahn endorsed me the other day.But you know what?I gave $350,000 to the RGA.Q    (Laughs.)Well, how is he going to do?Pfizer’s leaving the United States.Just one little outlier here.Go ahead.(Applause.)Do you know that in Japan if we get attacked, we have a treaty with Japan, if we get attacked they don’t have to do anything.We got some senators.Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.Thank you very much.And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians.I said, "Look" — and my wife is sitting (inaudible) — where did that come from, right?So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion.It's more than the Bushes.Sort of interesting.I said, "What would you call it?"I have such incredible support.We do not want to use it.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.I do.Did you read that?It’s so simple.Will you go to check out what happened?And we have no choice but to straighten out our military.Do you have any questions?More than three decades later, as President, he signed the bill that created our great Interstate Highway System â€” once again uniting us as a nation.I think weâ€™re going to make a deal.You know, Obama did that eight months ago with one of the cities.And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare.I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans—many of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.I have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money.I love blue-collar.But many of them are simply not doing so.Jamiel Shaw, an unbelievable young man, was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant.So I would approve it because I love the jobs of building it.But I heard his name for 10 years.I don’t think so.He debates...I said, "Ted, take it easy.I brought it.I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me.(Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  I donâ€™t know.They thought he was going to win.These were all things that weren’t talked about at the debate.I hear it’s unbelievable.Watch how friendly he is.Not too many people have said that.Theyâ€™ve never seen â€” they call it a phenomena.I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.And you know, it’s about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory.The economy is not good.But here’s what you do it.A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount – 10%.They died for us and with us.AND THEY LET HER GO.Sir, Mr. President, NAFTA â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.I said, "These are great people.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example â€” we will shine â€” for everyone to follow.Other people have been sent to jail.The guy’s not a smart person.I’m going to take care of our vets.THE PRESIDENT:  Maybe theyâ€™ll come up with somebody thatâ€™s not â€” theyâ€™re not going to beat me.By the way, theyâ€™ve started buying again.Weâ€™re going home.And when I called up Brett Kavanaugh â€” spoke to him and his family â€” and told them that I chose them, they were so happy and so honored.He voted for NAFTA.But weâ€™re going to straighten things out, folks.In America, those days are over.So that’s how we picked it.It’s true.And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.We’re sending troops.This is going to be a very serious wall.So, if we win Iowa, I think we’re going to win everything after that.Maybe this one will say, letâ€™s throw the other one away.You’re born a baby in Mexico, it’s like bye-bye.But weâ€™re doing great.I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.He’s actually a negative force.Five deep and long.And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people.We’re going to do so good with trade.Another major reform is going to be school choice.Your legacy will be that of turning the House of Representatives from a revered legislative body into a Star Chamber of partisan persecution.No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.And I loved being here.There are many of them.Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.Okay?Youâ€™re gonna be happy.I think if she gets out, he will get in.Again, I donâ€™t mind bad stories when itâ€™s true.I don’t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not.Don’t forget, he said "Trump will never run."Okay, it’s a lot of people but you know what?And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit â€” before I even started talking about the trade â€” it was a trade meeting.Does he ever speak to the Senate?Made in Japan.And we want people to come through.If I’m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if I’m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that I might not win, I think, you know, we’re a democracy.It canâ€™t get any worse.Q Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?And I put it aside.We have third world countries that are ahead of us.I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker â€” and pro-American.And then we leave and then they’re going to say, "Yes."It’s no good.I said, "Heroin?"I feel so badly.You can be tough, you’ve got to be smart.For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.They can buy it.I promise you.But when Ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and I had all these reporters.Very expensive to get it out.Look at Sweden.Does anybody watch television?These guys all want the Keystone Pipeline.And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.This is the time to reignite the American imagination.It’s a crooked outfit.I think we’re going to do great with evangelicals.And I said them a long time ago, and I was right.The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything – and say anything – to keep things exactly as they are.I mean, what he does and what he says is just terrible.So the drug companies.But this is a big con job.But I've always said, and I said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president.Q    â€” post-ISIS.So Obama’s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK?What does this mean for Americans?You sign your life away.It’s wonderful.It’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people – and I mean the American people.Q    Can you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal (inaudible) â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Iâ€™d love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians.And they don’t want it because their farmers don’t want our beef.Itâ€™s so nice.Weâ€™re doing Obamacare â€” weâ€™re in final stages.It just came out.Saved a lot of people.But I talked about that...and I talk about it a lot.My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby.One second.Number two, I’m a private company, so nobody knows what I’m worth.And I get along great with Hispanics.So I said, "All right."And, Lynne.During the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents.I really do.He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference.I did not.SO MUCH MONEY.And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump.That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.I wasnâ€™t supposed to get 222.But they said "If we don’t have to, let’s not."But maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us.Well, actually I do believe in free trade.They donâ€™t talk about that.They think I’ll be the best in the military because they say I – you know, I always say I’ll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.I heard their costs were too high.Just a single event.(Applause.)We’re tired of seeing what’s happening to our great country.That’s a sign of affection, and it’s a sign of respect, and I really do appreciate it.What is it about Trump that they like?BUT WE NEED -- WE NEED GREAT BORDERS.And I don’t understand.Because we won’t be able to do anything.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term.And once we got it going, it was going.Obama said they’re the JV.SO WHO HAS THE OIL RIGHT NOW?But she’s going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys.Same thing with South Korea.I’m working for you.Maybe radicalized him.If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.I have been a politician for 6 months.Not only do they get the $150 billion.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.THE PRESIDENT:  I donâ€™t blame you.I used to say "Senators, don’t come to my office.They’re the worst.I just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person.But you don’t have to do that.The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters.No, he’s the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen.I said, "Wait a minute.I mean, Chris Christie who endorsed me.That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests.I came down — it took courage.They sit behind their desk in Washington.The nationâ€™s greatness is more than the sum of its production.Did we show them something.You talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on.I’d love to.We need strength in this country because we’re withering away with political correctness nonsense.I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.It’s not something I wanted to do.We’re going to make our country so strong again.I’m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I’m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.We’re doing great with everybody.On a show.I mean, we have such talent in this country and we don’t use it.Yes or no?The whole country would collapse in two seconds.We’ve lost our manufacturing jobs.And we still made the deal.They know exactly what’s going on.(Applause.)Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.Here is what she said, exact quote, "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."We’re going to save Social Security.Very, very true.Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall.What can be simpler or more accurately stated?So if we donâ€™t fully pay, weâ€™re going to do a little work, but weâ€™re going to get our military rebuilt â€” bigger and better and stronger than ever â€” because we have no choice, folks.And you understand that.WE'RE GOING TO MAKE DEAL THAT'S BRING OUR JOBS BACK.AND WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG GREAT WITH THESE COUNTRIES AND TRADE WITH THESE COUNTRIES.They love — they don’t care about money, they don’t care about anything.You’ve been watching.But they’re the best in the world.I’m no longer competing with politicians.People are not silent.And we have a long way to go.The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater.Our country doesn’t win anymore.I don’t know if you saw Carrier air conditioner announced two days ago they’re moving to Mexico.I think.I mean, what they go through, it’s unbelievable.Everyone else bing.And then he appointed Justice Roberts.Look, I think people know where I stand.Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I donâ€™t know what to do with it we have so much money.I watched CBS.But he didn’t say it well.It’s not right.(Laughter.)We lose on everything.I think it’s fine.The people I’m dealing with – and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people.You cannot defend your extreme policiesâ€”open borders, mass migration, high crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare, destruction of American energy, late-term taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the Second Amendment, radical far-left theories of law and justice, and constant partisan obstruction of both common sense and common good.And I’m a member of the NRA but I’m not such a good shot.You wouldn’t believe if you heard the names of some of these countries.I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasnâ€™t doing it.From where?I’ve been honest.Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.Scott Pelley interviewed me.I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge.Itâ€™s not going to take years.But Bush has $125 million.You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing.In North Carolina, I have a great piece of property.I want nothing.Go ahead, Jim.At some point, I think theyâ€™re going to want to come back, and theyâ€™re going to say, â€œHey, can we do something?â€

And Iâ€™m very simple; I just donâ€™t want them to have nuclear weapons.Now I’m sort of like what am I doing?The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, weâ€™re going to arbitrate, weâ€™re going to all get together and weâ€™re going to get something done.But we are going to win.It was so simple to me.The only question is whether or not she’ll be allowed to run.WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE, WHICH IS A DISASTER.So they’ll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more.As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.So we have so many different things and what I’ve done with our tax plan, which something I’m very proud of, we’ve brought it down to a few groups.Perhaps â€” (applause) â€” we really have no choice.That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.Go ahead.Gets everything into the open.This was not me.It will simplify the tax code.She was sleeping.I HEAR WE'RE LEADING IN FLORIDA.We’re not going to be the people that get pushed around all over the place.We’re going to save your Medicare.And you explain it to me because I can’t – my numbers went up.Now I like you.Weâ€™ve got a lot of haters out there â€” they hate.The Iran deal.The Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it.But honestly, the public would appreciate it.Q    What about NAFTA?Do you remember when they had the one go three hours?Do you know the kind of money you’re talking about?I dream of running against those people.Okay?And I will tell you this.Boom!Thank you all for being here.I want to help."[U.S.A. chant]

Letâ€™s win on Nov. 8, OK?I won.I SAID KEEP THE OIL.Itâ€™s called chain migration.Iâ€™ve actually heard itâ€™s the most important decision a President can make.And I don’t know.It’s all Democrat.Deductibles are so high that unless you’re close to death, you’ll never going to get to use.You’re right about that.The company is incredible.We’re going to protect the guns.Okay?You know, I saw the other day on television, there were like 56,000 negative ads on me.And David did a fantastic job…And all of my people did a great job.On a thing called ISIS…oh, don’t worry."We’ve arrived.Since youâ€™re where?IT DOESN'T SAY, SUBJECT TO CHANGE, SUBJECT TO THE WEATHER, SUBJECT TO THE SUN DOESN'T COME UP.I was against going into Iraq from the very beginning, from the very beginning.But I would guarantee a big portion, because weâ€™re all on the same wavelength, folks.Should I read it?"Now she clutched him to her bosom.This guy right there, see?THE PRESIDENT:  I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct â€” not make a quick statement.It doesn’t exist, folks.It’s virtually useless.I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day.With this power comes an obligation, however â€” a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, and customers who have made you who you are.OK?It’s really trouble for him.Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me.It’s going to end.It’s true.And we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said I’m going to run for president I gave up a lot.And I think, honestly, we’ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and I’m very proud of it.WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.Yeah, sit down everybody.Thank you.Even when they – my wife said, "You know if you run, you’re going to win."So I just saw him this morning â€” I said, by the way, how did you do?(Applause.)And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.Thousands.WE WENT IN, SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.Watch, you just watch...And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy.And Iran’s going to take over Iraq as sure as you’re sitting there.And he doesn’t look like a motorcycle guy to me.You take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless.For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.Common Core is dead.Now they’re in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.Thank you very much.It’s true.But I have people — oh, they go and check.And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.What a lie it was.Look, I went through Congress.We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China.But then I said, what happens when Iâ€™m dealing with the problem of North Korea?But he spent $79 million.Some of the press doesn’t want to give it credit.WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.Say "You give our prisoners back or we’re not starting."Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.I don’t think he’s going to be a good president."They give it to you for nothing if you’re rich.Not 100%.I have a big heart.But they did something that nobody reported.What do you need to spend $1 million.They don’t want money.We are going to have fantastic trade deals.These are very wealthy countries.AUDIENCE:  USA!Our military is in a very bad state.I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.Itâ€™s very important to me.WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYONE.Iâ€™ve always loved business.Just remember what I said.They’re talking about the weather, right?Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.I think beating Hillary Clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad.We were talking about repealing Obamacare.They all agree.We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and theyâ€™re living in hell.I mean, when he just realizes, I mean he just realized that the Iran deal is a bad deal.These guys – when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians.And he said that very forcefully.And it is â€” I mean, a lot of the media is actually the opposition party.I’m at like 40% something – 48%.Nobody wanted to watch.So anyways, who cares.Iâ€™ve had great support from the Senate.(Applause.)(Applause.)And most importantly, all of the things that youâ€™ve been hearing about â€“the horror stories â€” in my opinion, theyâ€™re gone.And if itâ€™s so urgent, why not introduce â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.So we’re going to clean up our border.Look, we see it.I mean, look, he let us down.Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt.This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn’t want him in Mexico.And, guess what, she will probably say them.But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially.We’re going to find great people.And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans.We’re going to be so smart.Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her iPhones â€” with a hammer!OK, he was very nice.They are great people.I didnâ€™t need to do this.The fact is that about 2.5 weeks ago with Paris, I’m speaking a little bit differently now.Is that okay?And Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll make a very good deal.They’re already rich as hell.MADE GREAT DEALS AND BUILT A GREAT COMPANY.They’re not so stupid.I think you’re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.What do we do?I wrote something – coming out, I wrote something.The networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans.They are not being allowed to do their job.You have to see whatâ€™s outside, you wouldnâ€™t even believe it.God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.I want to thank Mexico.I have.Why does he have to tell – first of all, it doesn’t even sound good when you say "50 soldiers" because it sounds like so small.We have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn’t ask – I didn’t ask people to be here today.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, I understand â€” and youâ€™re right about that except this.Now, I know a lot about West Point.I love China.So here’s what they do.He says Trump, Trump.I didn’t want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going "Where did it go?They will tell you that walls work.Such a wonderful, beautiful woman.And Rasmussen just came out with a very good poll â€” youâ€™ll be liking this poll.Because I’ve been saying it for a long time.Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.So anyways, the bottom line, NBC renewed it.And I want people to come legally.But they don’t have business sense, they don’t have business ability, they don’t have common sense.We can do that.That means our message is unbelievable.I didnâ€™t want to go into Iraq.I SAID YOU'RE GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.You build your plant in Mexico.But he was a powerful president.Special, special.Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?Honestly, I know Hillary.But one of the â€” it was, but thatâ€™s okay.But she didn’t want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her.And no longer have any options.At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.I really believe that â€” because they were going to put on massive new regulations.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, maâ€™am, go ahead.All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.I know how good everybodyâ€™s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be â€” I think that it would actually be better.I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp. they’re leaving and so many companies are leaving.In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don’t have enough borrowings.But we never got the credit for that.It's an incredible movement with incredible people.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure.It was supposed to be 15 minutes.They’re going to have Syria.And you wonder why you get yourself in trouble.Q    â€” to follow up on â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.Today, you met with Bibi Netanyahu, from Israel.Ernie.We’re going to have a strong border, and I mean strong.Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it’s destroying our country.And once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three â€” Iâ€™m going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process.We have a lot of foolish people.But in another way, it works better because you have people governing themselves.I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.We have right now people that have no concept of what they’re doing.I have to win.BECAUSE I HAVE LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND I HAVE GREAT COMPASSION FOR OUR PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY.They got so much money.Women – what did you think?But everybody knows that, especially God.I didn’t expect that.And the reason is I’m a businessman.And he gave me like nine words.So here’s the story.And I said, "What about our children?"So I like the debates.They shouldn’t be allowed to do it.We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.These people, they work like endlessly, endlessly.We’re going to make the best trade deals you’ve ever seen.That wasnâ€™t the worst thing in the world.What’s happening there is absolutely a disgrace.He was â€” you know, Iâ€™ve heard his name.But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment.I have no choice."We came down that escalator and it was – I said, "Let’s go" to my wife, who’s been so supportive and so wonderful.We’re going to make it greater, greater, than ever before.Now, you see they just ordered 118 Airbus jets.Just wait.And honestly, I use Mexico as an example because they’re so tough.America is $20 trillion in debt.We are literally like a third-world country.And coming up today, I hear, "Well, there could be a way of Obama pushing it through."SO WE'RE GOING TO GET ON TO OTHER SUBJECTS.They honored me last year at the Waldorf Astoria.And we’re going to solve that problem.It’s inappropriate.ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.General Kelly likes it even more.And by the way, on Nov. 1, just before the election on Nov. 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases.We’re bringing your education locally.He knew about it.You’re traveling all over the place.Did you have many people there?"Okay?To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.That’s why I’m walking around.At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.You know, the only way they can do is if I’m a little bit short, if I’m two votes short I have a problem because I’ll have to go into that convention, I’m dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and they’ll make their deals and they’ll have all their money guys around and they’ll be in the backroom making deals.They said rich, you know, to say we’re going to make our country rich.And we’re part of the movement.This guy – why doesn’t he just give up, just go home?THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™ve been very proactive against Cuba.Where are you from?I mean, weâ€™re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged.HILLARY CLINTON IS INCOMPETENT, OKAY.I think the press – some of the press said I did fantastically well.I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos.And I'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and I'm a Republican.We will protect our borders at home.Well, I’m not calling him a Supreme Leader.He goes, "No, no, no.You wouldnâ€™t have gotten one vote.How else am I going to raise the money?There were things given.And they didn't know how to answer the question.We’re going to grab and grab and grab.Those days are over.We just canâ€™t have that.I like this question so far.Thatâ€™s how much divisiveness and other things there are.The issues I have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to Make America Great Again!And weâ€™re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.She can’t have it both ways.We’re going to do what we have to do, okay?I thought a comedian was saying it.You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics.We want all Americans to succeed, but that canâ€™t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.No, what does it mean?I think we’re going to go.Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course.Very important.We have all these cameras going back here.I think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that’s going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work.They’re not touching New Hampshire.I have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women.We will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity.Donâ€™t even think about it.Q No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said theyâ€™re not good.We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.I thought by this time I’d have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa.I go throughout the world.Q Mr. President, on national security â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Wait, letâ€™s see, whoâ€™s â€” I want to find a friendly reporter.Don’t worry about it.One by one, weâ€™re fixing it.The deal doesn’t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability.I. TRUMP: Thank you, South Carolina.We went to Hilton Head.I’m going to get along with the world.Same thing you heard with Obamacare.And he’ll say, "Please, please, please."And now, weâ€™re going to take that to new levels.I’m going to get somebody else."An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.Three, four weeks later they’re all saying, you know, Trump is right.I’m never eating Oreos.It’s an incredible thing.A big opening of a brand-new mine.Boom.All of the ladies can come but the guys can’t.They have to do it.I don’t know what’s he doing.Iâ€™ll give you an example.But, he said, "You can’t build a wall because you can’t do it."You look at that migration line; they’re young, they’re strong, they’re powerful.Incredible people.Nothing.A lot of things are better.They love it; they say "Why hasn’t this been done before?"And theyâ€™re great, great people.I said, â€œWho is he?â€  â€œHis name is Brett Kavanaugh.It’s a bank from China.That’s a single page where basically you’re signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement.Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.Taxpayers are paying tens of millions of dollars.That’s a big wall.But Iâ€™ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.So when you hear they raised $20 million, they’re paying – now think of it, who pays – the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I’m telling you it may be off but you all know it’s a lot.We are going to enforce our trade rules and bring back our jobs, which are scattered all over the world.And I just say this.And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform.I have thousands and thousands of Hispanics.Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted.And I have great relationships with Mexico and phenomenal relationships with the Mexican people.They said, "He’s a clown.Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance.In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer.I’ve seen market crashes.We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.Nothing works.THE PRESIDENT: Yes.I want borders.So the money stays in other countries and that’s what happens.But there is an establishment out there.But, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration.I said, "What did you mean by that?"Now I also did very well in Texas.The place is falling apart.Go ahead.Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.AND THERE COULD BE A LOT OF HARD FEELING IN THE ROOM.You saw the budget that was approved a month ago.BUT I ALWAYS SAID KEEP THE OIL.Look at her.Murray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he’s never seen that before.You’ve been great friends.Itâ€™s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.Do it."Maybe youâ€™ll have another chance.So Kelly said, you canâ€™t do that....What about the Republican establishment?Practically from the beginning we went up.They’re a terrorist state.(Applause.)They’re going to be very, very thrilled.And I’m at 24% or 25%, and they say, "Oh, couldn’t you have done better?"Otherwise, we’ve all wasted our time.But we can’t get them in anyways so what difference there.Nothing over me.I’m a man of great common sense.I’d bring that same attitude to the White House.And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?And that’s not going to happen.That’s like a loss.They ended up getting $250,000.I’m a former chairman.I love China.I’m telling you.Donâ€™t forget, that time, they said, â€œOh, Trump is saying these horrible things.The bad guys had the guns.They don’t have the sign "Merry Christmas".It was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in.I think it’s time.They lie to the American people in order to get elected.You know that....My sons are really great marksmen.Oh, forget that one.Every problem can be solved.It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs.We’re going to make a great deal.You know he wanted to be Don Rickles, right?‘Oh well,’ she cried, ‘I’ll take you in, and I’ll take care of you.’ ‘Take me in, oh tender woman.You all know excavators.And I want to just let you know, I am so behind you.AUDIENCE:  Booo â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.Q    Yes.What are you getting?Can you imagine me getting it from the Obama administration?Maybe I’ll go to the Grand Ole Opry tonight.You know, I’ll tell you, it is a question that’s asked a lot.But when I ran against Marco, it was supposed to be...well, he started it.YOU KNOW, THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, 16,500, FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THEY'VE DONE THIS, THEY'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP.So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they’ve wanted for many years.I mean, you’ve got to have Trump.Because the GSA, who are really professionals, they want to make sure number one that it got built.We have a military that doesn’t have proper instruction from leadership.And before I say it, I have to say this.Families passed through bustling towns on their way to explore the great American West.This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare.It’s amazing.Do you have a comment?Different planet.Look, I think most people say I did a great job in Iowa.But look, just do me a favor.We can’t.Okay?Because I haven’t heard.Itâ€™s a big thing to put it out.Pages of stuff.I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor.And by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way.They said, "Why?"But most importantly, thank you to all of the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day, making this a better world for everyone.I’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s lives.AUDIENCE:  Booo â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  This ruling makes us look weak â€” which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me.(Applause.)I just donâ€™t understand what you were saying.Yeah, go ahead, Jeremy


At this moment, absolutely not, no.Tennessee has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the institution of NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever in history.Number two, racism â€” the least racist person.I don’t hear it too much.I’m under budget, I’m ahead of schedule.I know how to stop it.I’m going to keep you free.We don’t win at trade.Every possible thing is tough about that.So itâ€™s not like, oh, gee, they have this.It’s very important.â€œGDP is down to seven percent.â€ And Iâ€™m saying, we were hitting one percent just a number of months ago.You have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and I won’t forget it.In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad.Not going to happen anymore.Go take care of her.I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built â€” all of the buildings I built in Manhattan and many other places.Not too nervous.You know, itâ€™s funny, Iâ€™ve said that so often, they donâ€™t even correct me â€” the fake media.My boy, Eric and Don.Now, Obama and his people call him the Supreme Leader of Iran.But I’m self-funding.And they’ll be manufactured here.They wanted to do a book.We donâ€™t want these big deficits.I mean, we’re doing really well there.I know how to do this.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.These are our great people and we must treat them fairly.I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't.We're not buying equipment that sells because they have political pull (ph).And you know what?The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that.But you wouldn’t even be talking about that subject if I didn’t bring it up.And Chris Christie endorsed us.Today, I am inviting all of you to become part of this incredible future we are building together.He’s down towards the bottom of the pack.I guess they werenâ€™t very exciting.How do you not approve him?Now, we have to build a fence.I will protect your Social Security without cuts.We expect to do very, very well.And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.Then Saddam Hussein throws a little gas.Bing.Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money â€” they run a great plan.Itâ€™s destroyed our manufacturing in our country.Everybody said and it’s very true.BILL O'REILLY, OF COURSE I'M ON HIS SHOW TONIGHT SO IF YOU GET HOME YOU WILL SEE THE SECOND EDITION.Unbelievable.And frankly, I’ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it’s Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what’s happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up.So itâ€™s a very big deal.We’re going to bring back our jobs and we’re going to keep our jobs.Look, I expect to be sued.So I donâ€™t want classified information getting out to the public.(Applause.)But 15, 16 people — 46 percent.We made the worst deal ever made with Iran.Because they shouldnâ€™t know.Do you think maybe he doesn’t like me?And we havenâ€™t even started the big work that starts early next week.You know, Joe [Arends] and the group [Veterans for a Strong America] called and they said "Would you come over and speak?"Thank you.Q    And how has (inaudible) â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.Go ahead.NO.But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it.WE LOVE YOU.Believe me.Q    Iâ€™m a Kurd.You know, all my life I’ve heard "If you’re a very successful person, you’ll never run for president.And congratulations.Mara, go ahead.But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you.It’s not older."How does that help us?Good....They’re going to have an incentive also to stay in this country.This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make.It’s not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess he’s down to one.When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign.Take the oil.The Trump PAC, the Trump PAC, the this PAC.They’re dead.You’ve never seen a crowd like that.Look what happened to New England.What energy.The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.But that wasnâ€™t that important to call, it was fine.And I just want to show you this because it was just shown to me, and I said, I think Iâ€™m going to show it to the media â€” both real and fake media, by the way.If you’ve got to do something, you’ve got to know what you’re doing.And Iâ€™m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming into our country."You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything’s going to be great."THE PRESIDENT:  China, now, put on $250 billion, and theyâ€™re paying 25 percent on that.Remember the poll numbers.Do you think Iâ€™m creating something?And 51% of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia.That’s a beautiful way of describing it – the motor industry.No, seriously.If you vote, weâ€™re winning.And we will support Israel beyond anything they ever have before.At what point does America get demeaned?I said "Don’t go there" anyway.He gets so much television.I didn’t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly.Thank you very much everybody.Jim, letâ€™s close those doors.But 63% almost – just a little over 62% – when you have that kind of a number with three people, it’s actually unheard of.They love it and they become so good at it.We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance.Japan is doing very well too.Well, I think we’re going to have great success here.Fine.So we’re going to bring that back locally and it’s going to be great.And it turned out that women were the biggest base.And they didnâ€™t.I’m not — I’m looking to win everything.When I look at the various people, they said so and so has $20 million.Itâ€™s catastrophic.Heâ€™d rather be working on tax reform, Jim.It’s horrible.This was 2,000 years ago.We are going to take care of our vets.They go back and forth.They take our jobs...I’m not angry at China.And I joked "Oh, I thought we were going to go from the Jefferson Memorial to the – " I was joking.And, by the way, General Flynn is right over here.They couldn’t care less.I don’t want one side or the other saying.He said, "What are you kidding me?I can imagine — I can imagine those discussions.As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  â€œThe reality is that withdrawing is in Americaâ€™s economic interest and wonâ€™t matter much to the climate.â€  The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.AND WE LOVE BOBBY KNIGHT.You know, you look at Atlantic City.Nobody’s perfect…
Now, nobody’s perfect.And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck â€” because itâ€™s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing.I could think of worse things.My wife will say, darling, itâ€™s too bad you got booed.Weâ€™ve got enough problems.Some of it went out more recently.They’re tired of that.WE'RE GOING TO BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.You know, they called it the wall.But look, we have a very serious mess on our hands.Iâ€™ve been a famous person for a long time.Then everybody starts to say, "You know, he’s right."We’re lowering taxes on business.Then he goes and has a news conference and I think he’s going to apologize and he doubles down."See?In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.Okay?And some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much.I know what you’re saying.We love Nevada.THE FACT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.They always do.And I don’t know that the voters appreciate it.Right?And everybody wanted it.We’re going to win.Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they’re at a point where they’re not going to leave because they’re fed up with what’s happening in this country, but I think they’re going to go to people other than Jeb.And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes.Q If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.And you are paying for it.And he said, "With Wisconsin, you’re going win."We have to have strong law enforcement also.Now, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people.It’s deadly — totally deadly.I don’t see how he can possibly get the nomination.The worst.WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.Front page.Right?They talk about – CNN is reporting other people’s polls.And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.James Comey at FBI.They sign it; nobody cares.We have to be vigilant.And if you remember, we started at nothing.They built a hotel.I spoke to one of the top people.Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down.They look good.We’re going to have our borders nice and strong.AND THE OTHER THING, WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN THEM BACK THE $150 BILLION.Who is better than me?I think maybe worse.If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.Wouldn’t be worth it.But I’ve taken a lot of heat on this one.If we don’t get tough, and if we don’t get smart, and fast, we’re not going to have our country anymore.Weâ€™ll do it again.The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion â€” nobody else is even close; most of them havenâ€™t even paid anything â€” including funds raided out of Americaâ€™s budget for the war against terrorism.Not just as Republicans â€” but as great and unified Americans.THE PRESIDENT:  I know that.Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right?I mean, the leaders are too smart for our people.And we talk about all the things that we talk about.Most importantly, we’re going to get to that office and we’re going to do the right thing.Iâ€™m going to say, â€œPlease join me on the deal.â€

And, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row.Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because theyâ€™ll say â€” one of the things Iâ€™m thinking of doing â€” this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that theyâ€™ve built over the last two years â€” which is a lot â€” and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, â€œWhat a lousy deal; thatâ€™s a terrible deal.â€

Like, ZTE, I got a billion â€” more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.She was here last night.Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.Iâ€™ve seen â€” have you ever seen?We’re going to win.Honestly.I mean, look at even you people.So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over "We don’t want it."Even I thought it.The terrorist attack on Pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault.I have the Bank of America building in California.They donâ€™t even correct me.Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war â€” if they must â€” they have to fight and they only have to win.And many, many of our most amazing military leaders, generals, admirals, amazing people, real fighters.We’re going to have jobs again.Oh, he’s brilliant.I mean, you are signing in programs, things that you will never, ever use, You know that.And Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all.Q    Senator McCain has called on you to defend your National Security Advisor, H.R.Throw them a ball if they have to play soccer – if they have to play at all.Now, with all of that being said, I feel strongly — I have a bigger heart than anybody.You know, we are bombing.I always used to say, keep the oil.We’ve got to build a wall.If you can’t make a good deal with a politician, then there’s something wrong with you.The Middle East, a disaster.Same thing over there.He gave a certain date, and the enemy said, "It can’t be possible.The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average Americanâ€™s household income by more than $4,000.He said, "Oh, I forgot.I don’t know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that’s going to be up to them.And weâ€™re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.I DON'T HEAR YOU.Okay.OKAY?I got out.Wow.I didn’t need to do this.Nobody says that.Q When you call it fake news, youâ€™re undermining confidence â€”

THE PRESIDENT: No, I do that.They go over there and they want to join ISIS.Why not just say itâ€™s a story I donâ€™t like?The real is how fast we’re getting together.Think of it.It took 11 months to build the Empire State Building.I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life.Thank you very much!We can give him back.The white one, right?People are closing up shops.I’m in first by a lot.Has to be.Number three.He doesn't — he builds plants.(Applause.)So we raised $5.6 million.Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens.Here's somebody where it's gone up.When people advertise – and I hope the voters can see this.It’s like, well, how does this all happen?They tell me that.We’ve got to straighten out our military deals.So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?They were waving to me as I’m going.Yeah.I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress.So I understand the environment; I’ve won many, many awards.You know why?But you know what?They’re not coming in the way they’re coming in now, just walking in like nothing.WE DON'T WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.Perhaps it’ll go down – and I’ve been pretty good at predicting things.Not a simple question, not a fair question.The biggest ever filed by the federal elections.I don’t know.And nobody can build like me.They’re not good.It’s not going to happen anymore.But before doing so, Iâ€™d just like to â€”

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sounds very interesting.So, this is a plan that’s simple, that’s a major reduction.There wasnâ€™t one word about it.They announced they’re going to leave Chicago with one of their big plants and they’re going to move it to Mexico.Benghazi.Same with Hispanic.In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.Changes for business – now, so important, because it’s all about business.You understand that.Q    Do you think that what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis?You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.(Applause.)SPEECH 10: President Trumpâ€™s U.N. Press Conference - Sept. 26, 2018

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody.I mean, I don’t know.REMEMBER THAT.So I filed.Many people were doing better.And I’m going to get the Gulf states, who have more money than anybody — we’ve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit.That’s not good.We’re losing our base.No, I raised almost $6 million.So, you know, I — I do this, and I love to do it.So itâ€™s very important to me.You just take a look at that show.Now, giving would be if I took the sanctions off.You know, we have this massive, massive amount of money that we have to get rid of because we’re sitting on one of the worst bubbles you’ll ever see.And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).Thank you very much, everybody.I’m the first one.People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they’d move to Texas or they’d leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they’d move to another location.We have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process.It’s a mess.Because they’re not getting stuff out because everybody – Japan and China in particular – is devaluing their currency.Every guy that attacks me so far they’ve all gone down.I mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving.We have a big, big problem.(Applause.)Okay, letâ€™s go.It’s very sad.You have a vast majority.But she says she doesn’t like him.And behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves.Good wife?Nobody’s leaving.They asked me for $1 million.Do not allow anyone to tell you it cannot be done.So I say they have 24 million people.Okay?So whatâ€™s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.It’s unbelievable.Amazing people.It gives great flexibility.Nobody.They put other people in there.It’s a message of common sense and it’s a message of competence.Trump, Trump – one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book.We’re going to make America great again.You’ve got it.They don’t show it.I think what we should do is she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before.And then they’re doing ads all over Wisconsin.American planes will soar in the sky.I’m a Presbyterian.For instance, the wall.You know, it’s not much for the advertising community when you think they spent $38 million – a record number in Florida.I wonder if Time Magazine had that one to do over again what they’d say.And they’re not moving New Hampshire either because they’re talking about Iowa, New Hampshire.WE USE POLITICAL HACKS.(Laughter.)And I say that not in a bragging way.You know, lightly, like "Oh ho, that’s so funny; ha, ha, ha."Trump 36% and then I won’t even mention the other numbers because they’re so low.You’ll still see me but you won’t see other people.Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal, they announced they’re building it bigger.That, and China â€” two of the most incredible events Iâ€™ve ever seen.Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives.Think about it.I didnâ€™t take any sanctions off.I thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 pound gorilla and the way he dealt with that little boy.And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.Weâ€™re going to be so strong.That’s a very — every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you.Very simple.And every single thing we’re going to win, win, win.Do you know if you look at some of the things, the catastrophes â€” you look at Orlando.Yes, maâ€™am.Okay?Second, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.Do you know the money I have turned down?They’ll say "No".Here, take a look.(Applause.)Time magazine, 49 percent.Wouldn’t it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education?But heâ€™s also going to be very fair with the Palestinians.But I think millions of people would have been killed.You talk about a great franchise.All the time.And let’s get going.And they’re doing this big thing about all day long last night about – I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize.And what we're doing...
And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud — and nobody else would even think about doing it — I fought very hard for it.But Cruz said they’re no good.It’s called amateur night.My father before me, incredible.Got 306 Electoral College votes.(Laughter.)Many things have been happening over the last short period of time.We have created 5.3 million new jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs â€” something which almost everyone said was impossible to do.I don’t want to tell everybody in this room – and look at all the cameras that are going now – I don’t want to tell the world what I’m going to do because they’re watching.Iâ€™m not talking about new laws.A little thing – Wollman ice skating rink.You know, some people are great fighters and some people arenâ€™t.There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.Just killed.And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run.Let’s say the cost of the wall is $10 billion.When you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that you’ve never heard of – charitable organizations.(Applause.)He was calling countries and his counterparts.That includes eliminating regulations crushing our coal industry.When I heard the poll today, they said "What are you going to do?"And the two-way street means that we’re going down one side and they’re coming up the other.For us it’s a horror show.And honestly, first of all, it’s like peanuts.Don’t we view this as war?Thank you very much.I never saw a race where they’re flipping coins.Theyâ€™ll buy our product.You would have real problems.â€

Q    And I â€” I want to â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I said, â€œYou should reimburse us for this protection.But it’s a very personal story.WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE FUND THESE SAFE ZONES.I guarantee.We’re going to have borders again.Thatâ€™s not so bad.But we’ve had an amazing – it’s been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator.Thank you.And I said, "I’ll do it but we have to talk about the country."Oh, but the lawyers arenâ€™t happy at all.I take such good care of my employees.That’s the way.Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day?Who said that?I have a team of just tremendous people, and I think weâ€™re doing a very special job.You can have anything coming across the border.Q    Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency?We’re going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again.And weâ€™re bringing our education local.The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important.I don’t want to have anybody giving.I’ve shown that for a long time.What do you have to do that for?Weâ€™ve had â€” many Presidents were unable to do anything, anything at all with North Korea.Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K- 12 education funding increase in the state's

yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words?I mean, I want to be accurate because I’d like the press to treat me.Come on, ABC.We filed papers.And I just want to say that one tough competitor and I can say that for the others.Right?But he wants to make a deal and Iâ€™d like to make a deal.Itâ€™s supposed to be secret.Not going to happen anymore.Look at the people I’ve focused on.They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad.Weâ€™re going to win it.(Applause.)Itâ€™d be very dangerous.The drug cartels are

"What would you do?"A $5 billion Web site.You know, Hillary said well, I’d like to run against Trump, believe me.I think sheâ€™s a great representative for this country.And then they become mainstream.We will, and we will succeed.Some of them I truly dislike a lot.Right?And, you know, routinely we’re going to have the border; we’re going to have this and that.They’re stupid people.And if the press would have reported it, I would have been very happy.When I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, I’m like "Get me – " I’d go crazy.It’s true.The Articles of Impeachment

theyâ€™re the worldâ€™s top sponsor of terrorism.I love China; I think theyâ€™re great.The waste that I get rid of – the waste that I get rid of – is going to have a huge impact and I’m not even putting that in my numbers so I think it’s going to be terrific.There is something happening.Depleted â€” itâ€™s depleted.And it’s going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in ’16, 2016.I think we should finish with that one.It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy.But you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like I was.And that future begins with prosperity at home.You know the guard rails.And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.And after that, weâ€™re going to come up â€” and weâ€™re doing very well on tax reform.Remember when we left, I was opposed to going in because I said you’re going to destabilize the Middle East.But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries.And I think one of the reasons Iâ€™m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.We have to be strong.We have to make it fair.Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:


"When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, they’re not sending their best.I built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always.It’s my eighth.And you know, they have boxes.And again, we have some great people going in.Let them come in, let them have all the fun they want.Very special.And we really appreciate what youâ€™ve done in terms of showing us something very special.Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened.We have made incredible strides.Itâ€™s amazing how quickly they say, you know, I think weâ€™ve decided to stay in the United States.I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley.Weâ€™ve had a great three days at the United Nations in New York.SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS THE SMART WAY.And thatâ€™s why the public sees it â€” they see it.They were looking for him.You know, 40% – a big percentage – will not pay any tax at all.And frankly, I wish I would have left about two days earlier.We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and we’re leading big in Florida.So all of a sudden, he’s using the term anchor baby just last week.And if you look at Yemen, take a look.False accusations.But once it’s straightened out, they could go home to their country, you know, to their area.And from the purely political world, a really great friend who did such an incredible job with his beautiful wife at the inauguration, Senator Roy Blunt.Q The first part of my question on contacts.And he keeps talking.Right?The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.This is the opposite of Hillary’s foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks.You’re not going to have to have anybody watching.I don’t want to run and find out it doesn’t work."But when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us â€” massive â€” and then on top of that, weâ€™re paying for their military?IT WON'T MEAN ONE VOTE THAN PERHAPS THEIR FAMILY.Theyâ€™re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.(Applause.)But they couldn’t.I want to do it.Q Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?Obama, ayeyeye.At first, I was embarassed by that.Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it’s a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the United States.Theyâ€™re charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products.I think I watched you recently when you said that.You can check with Sean Hannity.Q    Weâ€™re â€” weâ€™re kind of, uh â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, weâ€™ll do you after that.They’ve got billions of dollars overseas.How bad is that I mean, just as a deal...There is no reticence.Every election year politicians promise change.And so, you don’t like to use it.Make me number one next year.It’s a record in the history of this ship.And then I saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn’t believe possible.You know, Jeff Sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as he’s been in the Senate.We cannot let that happen.Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own.Representative Jason Smith.You’ve won already."It really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we’re all so proud of, but we’ve forgotten the middle class.They’re getting money from the pharmaceutical companies.You know, with this – we owe $19 trillion.But I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we’re not vigilant – [interrupted by protester] – that was the same person.But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.Weâ€™ve spent $3.2 [billion] and weâ€™re getting another $1.6 [billion].Incredible guy.We’re going to have such great deals.Nobody would win.But weâ€™re getting close to that point again where weâ€™ll create new records.We don’t know.And then China is coming here next week.And itâ€™s a beautiful, vibrant â€” this is an amazing place.When I don’t get over 50%, we have four people.And I’ll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben.And in the other case, â€œHeâ€™s incompetent.â€  They tried that for a week.See?It has to be first.You did not ask to be forgiven.I want to start by, as always, thanking my family.They live by a different standard.People say, "Oh, you don’t like China?"You can call it whatever you want.It’s coming from more than Mexico.But you don’t need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places.So, thatâ€™s happening.We have really great quality, higher than Canada.But I don’t want this.I tell this story.In fact, last night in front of the audience and I’ve never said this before.Thank you very much everybody!But itâ€™s still â€”

Q    â€” that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.They donâ€™t know what to do.â€  It never happened.I am not happy about that.The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record.And I’ve been saying that for a long time.The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if I’m elected.Give it to me, Steve.It’s like having it on his forehead "I am low energy".A lot of families go through hell over the death tax.An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all.I PLEDGE -- I PLEDGE, I SWEAR, I PLEDGE THAT IF I DON'T MAKE IT, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE NOMINEE OF THE PARTY.$3 billion?They come off those boats.How do you get 45% when you have seven people?…






Well, I think it’s a different book.Q    (Inaudible.)I give you my word.They’re very, very capable children.The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran.…I’m going to tell you a story about Nashville.So weâ€™re going to protect your Second Amendment.They do commercials about eminent domain.I think [Scott] Walker did a good thing.Better believe it.He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice and weâ€™ll see.And we can do that, but we don’t have to destroy our businesses, we don’t have to destroy our —


And by the way, China isn’t abiding by anything.I mean, we’re not going to let it.You’re going to hopefully be around.In particular I have to say Ted and Marco did a really good job and they got -- they did quite well as I understand.Now, until Iowa came along, I said "every poll", and then Iowa – what the hell are you people doing to me?WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER, EVER GONE IN.I don’t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem.And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with.He’s a horrible negotiator.They’ve taken our money.You know, it’s — I love getting up — and for the last couple of months, I have been leading from practically the time I announced, right?They put her numbers up and they didn’t put my numbers up.And so many pastors and ministers.We have such great potential.I don’t want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing.We are only going to have that.Sir â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Good.And I’m a free trader.He has no chance like she has no chance.We’re going to make it fantastic.See?And they do it with manipulation of currency.Because I’m a man of principle.Thatâ€™s being a construction man.And who else?Phil Ruffin gave $1 million...Ike Perlmutter gave $1 million.When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said "It will never be successful" because you know to have a big hit – a really a number one hit – you have to – and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever.We are also going to fully capture America’s tremendous energy capacity.If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .Okay?We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.So you have to open up the process.And I’ve had an amazing relationship with the Hispanics.And so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and I’ll tell you right now.Strong borders.The Times said, "Donald Trump railed at him and screamed at him."Thank you.There were so many cameras; I’ve never seen anything like it....Just so you understand.They are so happy.I’m only kidding.Q Mr. President, thank you so much.Ready?And I think that I just want to get it done faster, thatâ€™s all.So the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen â€” 52 percent in the polls.It’s like almost a disease.Nothing tops the Bible.WE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING.All my political people, theyâ€™re not doing so well.Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again.And just so you understand, Iâ€™m a free trader, but free trade has been very unfair trade.Thank you.He was, I believe, number one at Yale.But I may choose to hit them back.That’s terrible.BUT WITH THE PIGGY BANK, THEY TAKE THE MONEY OUT.Now, the press was there.He hasn’t gone that far yet, but believe me that’s going to happen.When are we going to come back and say, "We beat China" on a deal?So we’re going to have an interesting period of time.He’s been a negative force.So it comes out...I said, look, I would have to tell Japan and I’m talking about other nations also because I have great friends from Japan, I have great friends from South Korea.When does it help us?I was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, "Don’t do it.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting.(Applause.)Q On the leaks, sir â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, finish off, then Iâ€™ll get you, Jon.They â€” now whoâ€™s here from Venezuela?And then other people pick it up.How do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia?They want our military rebuilt.Itâ€™s a catastrophic situation, and thereâ€™s nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare wonâ€™t be around for a year or two.– they had $140,000 left for the campaign.The border is a disaster.I like that youâ€™re shaking your head, â€œyes.â€  Iâ€™m going to ask you the next question because of that.They were in their eighties, and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.I said, where are we getting the steel?But more importantly, we’re going to win for the country.In the last 10 years, our economy has grown at only around two percent a year.We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.Great job.Don’t worry about it.We’re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up.And you know I’ve had such a response.I think it was a very tough call.Let me tell you something.Do them over a longer period of time.Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests.(Applause.)If they do a single, if they do a double, Iâ€™m okay with it if theyâ€™re both happy.Weâ€™re not going to approve it.Normally, I wouldn’t say this but I need your fricking votes.So important.(Applause.)What can you tell us about that?So they said, "How are you going to possibly do it?"And I ran.And some Iâ€™ve been disappointed with.There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.A poll just came out where we’re tied, another one came out a couple of weeks ago, Fox, where I’m leading by four or five points against her individually.THEY WERE KILLED BY THE ENEMY.It must stop.I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.And in the end, in the end, I want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day.This is a hell of a big room.And he could do it from like Washington.What do we do?It says right there – you know, everybody says you have to go through a whole process, it’ll take many years, you have to go through every state.$2.5 trillion at least.There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage, together, to seize it.You still donâ€™t know the facts.A great guy.I love that.I’m doing that to say that that’s the kind of thinking our country needs.Speaker Paul Ryan, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.Weâ€™re also glad to be back in the heartland with the very, very fine folks of Missouri.You’d have a cold.I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune.So, Kanye West – I love him.I mean, when leadership is number one – they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot.Heâ€™s going to causeâ€¦â€

Well, I had a great meeting with President Putin.I said, "What do you mean?"But I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion.We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.But the one thing is you people don’t mention that.He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.So I’ll take that back.And I said I got to hit him at least once.Go ahead.We’re going to be building up our military.(Applause.)Look, I’m the one that gets all the nasty questions anyway.You donâ€™t think anybody would do a thing like that.And so I gave it to the Marine.She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values?And â€” but they raised them.At that celebration, the countryâ€™s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.Here’s the story, folks.They can’t do anything.I have so many – I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me.AND IF HE DOESN'T OVER THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS, I'LL TELL YOU.I want to do the right thing.I love you too.They were going to put regulations on.You’ll like me very much, believe me.I mean, I would have probably said we are going to stay forever.He’s been a tremendous success in everything he’s done.I am very confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country â€” not just on healthcare, but all across our government.Iâ€™m going to be watching â€” you know, believe it or not.That’s the difference between China’s leaders and our leaders.I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT.I can’t do that.Think of it.It’s always the same.Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.The drugs come in.You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.I’d rather give it to you, to your boy.â€œIt was too complicated.â€

Weâ€™re giving $150 billion, we paid $1.8 billion in cash â€” cash.Kanye West?I’m the right messenger.Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.Itâ€™s already under construction.She can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.You know whoâ€™s great now?This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.‘I saved you,’ cried the woman, ‘And you bit me.It’s true.We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of Americaâ€™s future.Here’s the problem.And we're going to change that.But Iâ€™m sticking up for the people.What are you talking about?â€  â€œNo, theyâ€™re going to getâ€¦â€  And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into â€” to really â€” to really do big destruction.We are going to have something that’s so special.Everybody wins except us.Thank you.You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.And youâ€™d need probably five rooms like this.In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense.He was so incredible.By the way, the French police did a great job and our Los Angeles police did a phenomenal job.We donâ€™t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.And I won it in landslide.We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.I just met your cops outside.We want to see good things.So unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she’ll easily be the candidate.And we didn’t do it.It's not working.But you take South Korea.They get professionals.Or stupid.You do.And a lot of the people sitting here are fake.A new era of American greatness is just beginning.What you’ve done is down in the history books.But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves.But one of the things he said was "He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else."Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American.They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart.You know why.All you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you don’t feel so good about our country.SO I JUST TELL YOU THIS, WE HAVE A CANDIDATE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO, IF SHE EVER GETS ELECTED, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE DISGUSTING YEARS OF OBAMA, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF WEAKNESS, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF CIVIL UNREST.I think it was four big pictures.We’re going to have a wall.But wait a minute.Iran has the biggest — think of it.We’re going to do some shows and we’re going to be around and we’re going to make sure – we want to bring this home.We’re going to solve corporate inversion.Thank you.A lot of energy.Miss Universe, by the way, I made a great deal when I sold — oh did I get rich.Gov.Well, I enjoyed it.When I first started, I had nothing.As you said, "We are; we’re saying it."They told me â€” without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that theyâ€™ve become used to it â€” that itâ€™s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel.There should be no fear â€“ we are protected, and we will always be protected.And, by the way, if it doesnâ€™t meet environmental safeguards, weâ€™re not going to approve it.They’re going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall.And it could be because when you’re looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it, you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you can’t get the job – you know what I’m talking about because you’re shaking your head – and you can’t get the job, essentially for statistically purposes you are considered employed.Yes, go ahead.They all said I’m not running and I ran.They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.They really know what theyâ€™re doing.56,000.THEY ARE REALLY DISHONEST.You just can’t run for president, and I can see it.And I’m not.Iraq, Syria, all into chaos.(Applause.)Whatever it was, it was.Itâ€™s becoming very strong.The job he did was incredible.We will take care of it.The Border Patrol knows this.Without us they wouldnâ€™t be there for two months.WE DON'T WIN.So we’re going to change all that stuff folks.I do.Thank you, James.Iâ€™m in favor of law enforcement.I’ve gotten to know Al a little bit primarily through New Hampshire where we had great victories.We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.Nobody talk about that.Why can’t he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth?I said, well, I donâ€™t see â€” to me, he was doing the job.Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.I said, "Who do you want as your president?"Weâ€™re not going to playing games.I used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now it’s $19 trillion and it’s only going up.We’re going to do it by putting America first.You know, itâ€™ll be a whole different story.He’s a good man.Itâ€™s a lot harder work, but itâ€™s a lot cheaper.Who knows?But the Muslims have to work with us.And it just goes on and on and on.Nobel Prize.Even in Wisconsin, I mean, you see the jobs, the manufacturing, it’s all so down and so gloomy and throughout the United States.Can you see over there?That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, AAA.We’re going to get jobs.SPEECH 3: State of the Union Address - Feb. 5, 2019

THE PRESIDENT:  Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States â€” (applause) â€” and my fellow Americans:

We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.I would...






... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in — and I wouldn’t even use — you know, I have — I know the smartest negotiators in the world.ISIS — ISIS was two.Keep your eyes wide open.I think he’s [referring to Ted Cruz] certainly was dirty what he did to Ben Carson was terrible.You know that, right?We protect Germany.And join me in rededicating ourselves to the common good of this nation that we all love so much.How are they going to beat ISIS?I wouldnâ€™t have known.I’ll explain it...You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket.And these are great companies in many cases.I’m truly honored by your support.I guarantee you within 48 hours they’re calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back.Are you mostly conservatives?The journey made a great impression on then young Eisenhower.Forgetting about the campaign.When I went to Iowa and you know what I love?The country should do that.And we need great trade deals and we’re going to make great trade deals.But when you look at how we’re impinged and hurt.Thank you all very much.Millions.I like them.I mean, I see hats — they’re like helmets.But I’m in first place by a lot.We defy the impossible.Stronger than ever before.And we have those people.– and it actually could be even worse than that.YOU KNOW, WHERE ARE MY PROTESTS.You have to confront it!And I have to say that number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign.Am I â€” is that right?During the Obama administration a couple of years ago.Q    Do you believe your words are helping to heal this country right now?(Applause.)I’ve toured New York.His magazine is failing, as you know.I mean, it’s only confined to this (inaudible).WE'VE GOT TO BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK.We have made incredible progress.They didn’t know what it was for.It’s something we have to do.It will be saved.This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs â€” not what we need â€” believe me, this is not what we need â€” including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.It’s record-setting.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you!I kept saying, "There’s got to be one."By the way, it’s a great company.And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me.I don’t want them because we don’t know who they are.Nobody thought I was going to run and they said "Oh, he won’t run and he won’t put in his papers.No, it’s true.If it’s hot, it’s okay.We all salute the same flag.Weâ€™re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.And they said, â€œWe donâ€™t care if we get hurt.Thank you very much.They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.The people in this community -- every time I see them they want education locally.And I don’t know much but I say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn’t believe in Tennessee, in Texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they’ll stand for hours and hours to get in.I go all over the world.It wasn’t easy to find a guy that could do those hats.And I opened it up â€” not on the front page, but there was a very big story.For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back.Do you understand that?Every place we go to, it’s like this.No other â€” you know, we didnâ€™t have a deal with China.It’s unbelievable.But our country will never have had a military like the military weâ€™re about to build and rebuild.He said, "What you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States."The question was what did I get for signing the pledge?It’s an amazing.He landed in Saudi Arabia.But weâ€™re not playing the time game.(Applause.)WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR MANUFACTURING BACK.Thank you, sweetheart.It was below zero.THE PRESIDENT: Well, I donâ€™t know.And they wonâ€™t be.Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.Because only then can we truly make America great again.And what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were – we shot right up.I’m not doing this for fun.(Applause.)Right?They shouldn’t be doing that.Tell me.We got 306 because people came out and voted like theyâ€™ve never seen before.And we’ll try to get them back real soon and we’ll do it through a legal process.So Iâ€™ll take Paris over the seven.They were with me a week ago.Does that sound good?But I keep saying, "Well, are the Republicans going to fail or are they going to crack?(Applause.)Most people said I’ll never run.But much more importantly than all of it â€” much more important â€” much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship.You know we weren’t expecting—a couple of months ago, we weren’t expecting to win this one, you know that, right?They look at me, and they canâ€™t even answer it, because thereâ€™s no answer.Wait a minute.I won’t happen to me, I promise.But we have to be tough.Just having fun."Q    Mr. President â€” (inaudible).And we do two or three and sometimes weâ€™ll be hitting four a day.I felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors; they get these little polls.So he left.So, I watched the politicians and they have no business instincts.You know they keep forgetting.THE PRESIDENT: I donâ€™t have to tell you what Iâ€™m going to do in North Korea.Governor Greitens is here, who is doing some job.SHE DID A GREAT JOB ON THAT.Q    Weâ€™re kind of thriving, not failing these days.Q    But do you want to hear her story before you draw a conclusion â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™d like to hear her story, yeah.We don’t have teleprompters.Any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the United States will be met with sharply
Six: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO.But other businesses – I sort of – like the shirts and the ties with Macy’s.My employees are lucky.The insurers are fleeing....




I’m entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care.And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR POLICE AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly.They are right now – who knows what’s happened to them?Okay?But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more.WE'RE GOING TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY.And we’re going to get those miners back to work.Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.Many of the people never even come here."Please reconsider," I’ll say no.Are they going to spend – he’s going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money.So they’re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago.If you look at what happened with steel, weâ€™re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers.You will be cover for all time.It says it like it is.I mean, we’re going to do the right thing.Itâ€™s not like â€” frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.We did really fantastically and came very close to winning.Sean Hannity covered it.Big impact.And President Obama essentially said the same thing.Common Core is a total disaster.Do it.I have a plan that Larry Kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they’ve seen.Of course if you listen to the pundits, we weren’t expected to win too much, and now we’re winning, winning, winning the country.I believe that I will have a very good relationship with Putin.Some of the greatest assets – Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan.And every place we’re speaking, if we have 10,000 people it’s like a small group.BECAUSE THE ONLY TIME THEY MOVE THE CAMERAS ARE WHEN WE HAVE A PROTEST.Right?Can you believe this?We’re taking care of all these countries.I didn’t want to go into Iraq.I grab and grab and grab.(Applause.)I just heard coming up, you know, the Senators.(Applause.)In some cases, years and years waiting.Politicians are all talk, no action.And I talked about that.I want to just say thank you to my family.We’ve rebuilt China.We’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful.I’ll be honest.And they get – what do they get?And people are screaming, â€œWhatâ€™s taking so long?â€  I said, â€œOh, I get it.â€  You got to understand the media.Okay?We have those people.They don’t do great, especially the early Republican debate.The unemployment numbers are among the best weâ€™ve ever had ever.Not going to happen.I take.Thank you very much.As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.So we're going to do a lot of beautiful work.But yes, we have to look at mosques.This time, from totalitarianism and communism.I will know very quickly whether or not I’ll be able to put that deal together.How many topics?It turned out to be true.So I watched – somebody asked, "What would you do about Carrier?"From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.And maybe that’s not a perfect conservative view, but I can tell you one thing.This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I canâ€™t get my Cabinet approved, and theyâ€™re outstanding people.China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.It’s sort of like the fighters.They protest and they send it back.You donâ€™t mind having a rich nation again and having lower taxes, do you?I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re going to want to so much.We have to send thousands of people away.Weâ€™ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.Okay?We have losers.For the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise.The Democrats went out and said, â€œOh, they shouldâ€™ve done better.â€  So what Iâ€™m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives.I keep taking.I want a room.We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.They’re right now afraid of doing anything.But he doesn’t let me respond.Well, look, I always liked Marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile.It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.I love the Hispanics.Why?We’re going to be manufacturers again.You know, it’s funny.WE'RE GOING TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.He’s a terrible person, a terrible human being.We have to be unpredictable.You saw the one who wasn’t politically correct to (ph) report them.You know, he was a comedian or something.Because I happen to think it’s very bad for their brand."(Laughter)


I love you.And so we’re going to have some fun.I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that.We do a massive safe zone.Ivanka’s home right now.Okay?THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.And I would love to be in the room with the Democrats, close the door â€” you guys are all away, outside, waiting.These are great people.And I’m the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.Obama yesterday – President Obama yesterday for the first time he started having reservations about the Iran deal.Because I was going to split the $1 million check up amongst...and in the end I just didn’t want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups.All right?WAS IT TRAINING?I mean, normally I wouldn’t.It’s very simple.It’s incongruous.But Iâ€™m especially pleased to be here in Springfield, the birthplace of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Who would have known that?They have their own problems.Now, I’m much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother.Really incredible people.It just takes one little flick of his finger.But as far as I’m concerned, I really don’t care that much.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.Companies like Carrier Air Conditioner just moving into Mexico.And they understand that, too.We do a lot of good work.For instance, I went down this weekend to do Rolling Thunder.You know, I just — he never treated me fairly.Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharonâ€™s granddaughter Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison.Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.New Yorkers are very good.Okay?We will make America safe again.And we’re going to have victories.Our country is going to hell.All you have to do is ask Israel.He’s a great guy.Just wanted to get untangled.Thank you.The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.I built a great company.She couldn’t get out of bed.I think thatâ€™s right.I hit Jeb instead, right?I’m self-funding my campaign.Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.Weâ€™re going to stand up to China, and keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership â€” another catastrophe.THE PRESIDENT:  George Washington was a slave owner.They said, "Oh, he’s actually going to do it" because most of them said "He’ll never do it."You know, I’m from New York.But they’re not good.(Applause.)And when they said that Ben Carson was out of the race and come vote for him, I thought that was terrible.You know that.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.We’re not going to let companies leave.But we’ll take care of that.Putin hates us.And this is the system that our Founders wanted.Two great people.So that’s it.They didn’t have Caterpillars.Okay?OUR MILITARY IS SO DEPLETED, OUR MILITARY HAS FIGHTER JETS THAT ARE IN USE FLOWN BY GREAT, GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE SO OLD, AND THEY CAN'T GET PARTS FOR THE FIGHTER JETS.You’re going to have so many deals that is so good for you.And your wife not working?I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil.Q I am.Big reduction.Originally from New York.Most everybody.Look, Hillary Clinton – you know this story.You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.(Applause.)And I just want to let you know, the reason youâ€™re the number-one stop is exactly the opposite â€” exactly.We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.Honestly, we just went over that.The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, weâ€™re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement.We’re going to watch him.THE PRESIDENT:  Youâ€™ve been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?Not going to happen anymore.And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.They didn’t report them, and the reason they didn’t is because they don’t disagree with them so much.When you see Pfizer moving to Ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they’re leaving."We’re finished with the United States."A great country also takes care of its warriors.Where are you?They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places.Remember that.So, I want to ask you: Yesterday, you were talking about your administrationâ€™s accomplishments at the United Nations, and a lot of the leaders laughed.You know, the only time — don’t worry about it.Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.So now ISIS has the oil.Q There will be a â€” in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?We had old equipment.Weâ€™re getting another $1.6 billion in borders.I gotta do it, Dad.THEY SAY BUT YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL.We have no choice.So many people talk to me about the Second Amendment."Well, you know, this is surprising but he’s reached his plateau."AUDIENCE:  Booo â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.We raised a lot of money.Q    What do you â€” well, let me ask you this â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Take a look at our federal prisons.That guy.People are dying on — they can't even see a doctor.Okay, so that’s the end of that.These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.She can’t have it both ways.Everybody.And so I responded.You know.They come up to my office.People will treat us fairly if I become President.BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, NUMBER ONE, WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THEM BACK.YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE.Weâ€™re going to take care of our vets.BUT I AM THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE.And I was so nice.I would never want to do that.I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.It’s not right.Now, if I have a Republican who’s not on my side, I’m not going to be – why should I be particularly nice to that person?This effort will be guided by two core principles:  buy American and hire American.I donâ€™t think the public would.Come in.Most incredible.I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities.BECAUSE HE USED TO SAY, WE'LL NEVER BUILD THE WALL.I’ve never done television.Nobody knows what they just said.SPEECH 16: President Trump Remarks on African American History Month - Feb. 2, 2017

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.It’s just going to be more of the same.A dummy.Itâ€™s gone.They want solutions.Why is he harder on me than Putin?And the press – look at all those cameras going all live, all – you know, nobody else has cameras like this.OK?So we have 28,000 people on the border separating South Korea from this maniac in North Korea, we get nothing.No matter what is going on in your life, you have got to out and vote.I’m trying to figure out.That is the future I want for our people.MR. SCHWAB:  Yeah.Thank you.Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations.How the hell does that help us?12,000 people.And you can ask President Obama about that, because heâ€™d make speeches about it.Right?Q    Sure.And then gets killed by the same people.That’s the newest fighters.You know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you.I wonâ€™t forget it.You know, it’s him.Weâ€™re going to protect the environment, weâ€™re going to protect peopleâ€™s safeties, but, let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and weâ€™re going to bring it down to where it should be.Right?The heat I took was unbelievable.We are going to stop drugs.Thank you, Roy.Okay?That’s the kind of thinking we need in the country.The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three â€” itâ€™s going to be great.And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans.Right now itâ€™s terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really â€” you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show.I always — and this came to me two weeks ago.Think of it.Together, we will put the American people first again.And youâ€™re going to like these three words.(Applause.)We’re going to win.Okay, here’s the story, folks.Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time.Because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all.We’re going to do it.They’re there because Hillary Clinton’s campaign sent them.When this started, it started with a speech in Iowa when I said let’s raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million.And all we want to do is to be treated fairly.This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I don’t spend any money of the taxpayers.Our approach is based on principled realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.â€œCouldnâ€™t have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump.They don’t want to give us our four.America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.Paul Ryan called me the other day – tremendous call.A WALL.I said, "Wait a minute, I’m a businessperson.It’s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.And at this moment, the answer is absolutely not.He was a traitor."Iâ€™m a person that very strongly believes in academics.We must replace our current system of extended-family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy, to support themselves financially, and to strengthen our country.And I always make the reference.That's so nice.Think of it.But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump – I mean, it looks just like it’s meant for a horse not for a child.They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right?No, no, he’s a man of insult.But I’m talking financially.I think low-energy was a brutal statement, right?We’re going to put America back to work.The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time.And also big reason the tax is too high.It’s wrong.In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom â€” a boom that has rarely been seen before.One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left.But I said to myself, "You know – "
By the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please?But I want to thank all of those people that — delegates that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something.I donâ€™t want to play the time game.Where are my vets?I donâ€™t know what happened today because Iâ€™ve been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with China, and about seven other countries, as you know â€” and I chaired the Security Council.They said, "How are you going to get Mexico to pay?"Let’s make the process complicated."I jokingly say but I mean it – the Bible tops it by a long way.Do you understand that?Well, we do.We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.Itâ€™s time to give American workers the pay raise that theyâ€™ve been looking for for many, many years.Negative, horrible, negative commercials.And then you wonder why there’s crimes in our cities.And I just want to leave you with this.Itâ€™s ridiculous.Thank you.As it is tradition at the forum, I will ask you one or two questions.If they donâ€™t, weâ€™re taxing the hell out of their products, so you know theyâ€™re coming back.And Reince happens to be doing a good job.They can’t even answer simple questions.So I’m saying it right in their backyard.Wonderful man.She said sheâ€™s going to bring back jobs, jobs, jobs.Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu – their big tractor maker – and others.And we’re going to have great economic development.And look, I want clean air and I want clean water.And the reason I’ve had response is because of that and then I look at the ads today.Q But arenâ€™t you â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.It’s going to cost less and you’re going to get better care…


So the Keystone Pipeline, first of all, I’d approve it because it’s thousands of jobs.We’re losing our manufacturing.I was right.I’ve learned that they’re great people.Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I’ll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets.And I said, "I’ll never win."This country was seriously divided before I got here.So, what are they going to have?Okay?I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know--  No American company comes to see and comes to bid.AND THEN I SPOKE WITH SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO FROM ARIZONA AND HE CALLED ME OUT OF THE BLUE AND I'VE READ ABOUT SHERIFF JOE, I MEAN, HE KNOWS BORDERS, RIGHT.In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.See, thatâ€™s a real worker.Look where we are now.And he’s been a horrible president.I don’t care about that.I have millions and millions of people.Letâ€™s go.We have now migrations ,largely because of what’s happened afterwards.So we’ll see what happens.Nobody — no, we’re not; we would never do a thing like that."And I want to thank our friends.I had one friend that came into my office – I don’t think I’ve ever said this before.It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur....We just did a big interview with CNN just before this.Where are all these European countries?But I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee.We donâ€™t want the jobs going to other countries.And you understand it.Right?Give me a break.Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.Imagine the breakthroughs that will breathe fresh life into forgotten places.Because that’s very anti-Iowa.They are undocumented.And remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them.And I just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track.They just built a hotel in Syria.Obama talks about the Supreme Leader.Because people are tired of political speak.It’s over."Hallie, Iâ€™ve know them for a long time and â€” a lot of these people.Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.We got nothing but unemployment.When they call up, "We’d like to speak to the donor that is negotiating it."I only say – I’m in favor of vaccines.She’s not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesn’t want her to.They said "Trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump?"We’ll go ahead.And, happily, weâ€™ll win â€” I think.I’ve got to get along with everybody."All my life I’ve been in competitions.That was in the newspaper.It was all cordoned off.You can’t see what’s going on from Washington, D.C.But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again.The reason they donâ€™t want me is because they want to run the show.And I have a friend who’s a very, very successful man, and I went to one event – he came with me.That’s not going to happen.I won’t mention who but some of them disgusted me.And very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country.Among the largest oil reserves in the world.We can’t be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things.I’m not saying dress.We don’t eat it.THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, Iâ€™ve used much worse language in my life than â€œcon job.â€  Thatâ€™s like probably the nicest phrase Iâ€™ve ever used.Q I know some of them, but Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re watching right now.And by the way, if you want, you could put your name up and you say "I want to run" and you go to the convention and you run.The other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll.They’re laughing.I have property over there – the taxes are through – I’ll use an expression – coming out of my ears, okay?Because whatâ€™s happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.People set them up.Mexico is making an absolute fortune — peanuts, compared to the cost of the wall.But the biggest disasters are regulations.The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period.And weâ€™re giving you a lot of surplus.Right, Billy?Oh, he’s not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and we’re very happy about that.I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid.THE PRESIDENT:  I do.But 13,000 miles that’s a long time.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.The other day I was in Florida, we had 12,000 people in Sarasota at 12 p.m. with the football games going on.FAR WORSE.I mean, we’re going to just do what I have to do.It’s so great to be at Mar-A-Lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.We can’t allow that cancer to continue.Q    But youâ€™re saying why (inaudible) â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.So, we’re going to take care of that.Some very big things are going to be announced next week.The press has become so dishonest that if we donâ€™t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people â€” tremendous disservice.So we protect all and big ships they make.We're making a big speech tomorrow in Atlanta and then we're going right to Nevada.A couple of you have heard it but some of you haven’t.It’s zero.No, because a lot of times they know it’s wrong.And so I want to thank everybody for being here.I THINK WHEN THEY LOOK BACK ON HILLARY CLINTON, THEY WILL SAY THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON WAS GETTING OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WITH E-MAIL TZ.But I like him nevertheless.And he was – it was such as horribly put question and so obvious.You know that I had a totally innocent conversation with the President of Ukraine.People are saying "This is turning out to be a disaster."You people don’t.AND IT'S GOING TO BE WIDE OPEN FOR PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY LEGALLY.Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran’s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.READ: How Donald Trump Says He’d Win America’s Trade War
Top U.S. Labor Leader Blasts Donald Trump in Dueling Speeches
My campaign has the opposite message.You’re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.Q Youâ€™re the President.And who knew about these debates?He said it very forcefully.We've tried it President Obama's way.Q    Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that youâ€™re concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldnâ€™t get it through other ways?I’m going to do something about it.But I’d like to finish first.Thatâ€™s the deal, folks.AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GO THROUGH IT AS A GROUP.Third rate.Go ahead.Believe me.Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.That woman!This is my check for $1 million.I don’t have to go into them.Number two.I’m telling you.You know, I won Arizona very big, and Sheriff Joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it.I was with him the other day.We gave Iran Iraq.Not one vote.AND YOU DOUBLE UP YOUR SANCTIONS, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD THEM BACK WITHIN 24 HOURS, I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.Thank you.I must say this tremendous run that we’ve had started with New York when we had almost 62%.If we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money?Can’t get it over there.Can you imagine a balanced budget?Weâ€™ve appointed a Supreme Court justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia.He was only there for a short period of time.And I have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.Tucker Carlson has been great.Folks, you can’t straighten out this mess – we’re in a mess – if you can’t do what you have to do.If we didnâ€™t have the wall up, and if we didnâ€™t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; theyâ€™d be welcomed to the United States.They’re grandmasters of that – devaluation.Post-ISIS.Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.So again, I want to congratulate Ted Cruz.Donald Trump.â€

So I like her, but sheâ€™s off the reservation.Don’t forget they talk about my tone.Some of the fake news said, I donâ€™t think Donald Trump wants to build the wall.Trans-Pacific Partnership will be almost as bad as NAFTA.Go ahead, what would you like to say?But — and if we have Hillary — I’ve got to tell you.There are many scammers out there.And you know, and by the way, we are going to get rid of ISIS and we’re going to get rid of them fast.But you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups.We don’t want their money.Not a good deal.So now, they have the largest oil reserves among — in the world.And the reason is – you know why?We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action.Weâ€™re going to have a good time.Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules.We have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year.His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.You look at Ben and he’s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare.Simplification.Remember what I said.(Applause.)31,000 people came to see us speak and we’re talking about making America great again.We have seen the attacks at home â€” from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.Mexico makes a fortune off the United States.THE PRESIDENT:  What difference does it make?And they go into a room and, I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what theyâ€™ve pulled off on you and on the public.It is time to exit the Paris Accord â€” (applause) â€” and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.And actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump.Any way you want to do it.Nancy knows it.It was an NBC poll.It’s going to be a lot of work.Thank you.So then he hits the banks.And she has been so supportive and so like just incredible of what we’re all – what we’re trying to do.Q    But youâ€™re â€” are you going to notify Congress of pulling out of NAFTA?This is a lot more than 200 people.They’re not being take care of fine.Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind.I would say – I don’t see threats.IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN I'M YOUNG, I WOULD SAY WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU BACK THE 150 BILLION, YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.Let’s take it."And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country.And honestly you see the crime statistics.We’ve been making – I’ve been making speeches, three today, four yesterday, three or four the other day.You said that you also â€” your false allegations that you feel like were made against you make you feel like you donâ€™t want to believe these women.I said, "It’s obsolete."And itâ€™s being perpetrated by some very evil people.HE SAID, AND HE WOULD GO LIKE THIS THE LUMPS OUT.It’s a disaster.I can’t help it, honey, whether I’m celebrity.This is an amazing tradition.I never saw so many cameras in my life.AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM BACK, YOU LEAVE THE MEETING.Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago?The problem is, no one has done anything about it.And thatâ€™s a great thing.THE PRESIDENT:  I think theyâ€™ve gotten better or the same.If we don’t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don’t win, it’s a terrible waste of time, because you’ll have somebody else in there.So instead of saying Trump made a speech in front of a packed crowd, they said "Trump was disappointed" because I didn’t have millions of people going from Jefferson to Washington.But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign.We get the delegates.I said, â€œTheyâ€™re surrounding a city of 3 million people.As far as I’m concerned, it’s fine.Because I want to be unpredictable.Additionally, I would be the best jobs President that God ever created.Oil pays him a lot of money.It’s labor, and it’s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren’t in unions, and it’s all over the place and building all over the world.And now they are beating us economically.â€œas he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be

CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council?We have right now – and people don’t know this.Itâ€™s terrible.A lot — a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out.But he said, "We’re going to build a wall at the southern border."And itâ€™s all about unification.What happens is they’re going to do budgets like we’re going to do this and that and I tell this story – then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up "Darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels.Where is he?Now, theyâ€™ll take this news conference.And it’s impossible for our people here to compete.Oh this is a great place.We have to get along with everybody.No more nonsense.Right?The money they took out of country, we rebuilt China.It’s a scam and it should be stopped.She has lower energy than Jeb Bush, which is hard to believe.Okay?And as you know Liberty University—do we love Liberty University?When Elvin â€” (applause) â€” thank you.Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.And it’s only going to make it harder.Not the greatest, but not bad.Who knows?I love it.But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.Thatâ€™s what I want.It's really, really crazy.You have not been

right?It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania â€” along with many, many other locations within our great country â€” before Paris, France.Reduce taxes.So this has been really great what youâ€™ve done and putting it together, the economic forum.All of that will stop.And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.Thousands.And then he left.One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities.EVER.The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country.But the wall was stopped because they couldn’t get an environmental impact statement among other things.You need a very strong person with tremendous energy.THEY'LL BE HAPPY TO PAY FOR THE WALL.Our infrastructure will again be the best, and we will restore the pride in our communities, our nation, and all over the United States weâ€™ll be proud again.I’m for it.He got everything he wanted.So I’m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit — you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right?I look forward to hearing from her.(Applause.)Before we discuss the Paris Accord, Iâ€™d like to begin with an update on our tremendous â€” absolutely tremendous â€” economic progress since Election Day on November 8th.Not me.Steve is always calling.And yet out of 30 countries we're ranked number 30.One question.And he has got an amazing future.She’s been working the polls.(Applause.)President Obama thought you had to go to war.So, we’re going to build a wall and Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, believe me.Weâ€™ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and weâ€™ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.It’s better than being a real estate broker.I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how.SPEECH 2: Remarks by President Trump on Iran - Jan. 8, 2020

THE PRESIDENT:  As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.We’re leading big in Florida.And it’s impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night.Thank you very much.Since my election, weâ€™ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially.Weâ€™ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.And that’s the press.This is a wateredâ€“down version.But you know, there’s somebody that was – I saw just a little while ago in the audience a very special woman, an incredible woman, and Melania just said hello and met her was so taken, and she represented you so beautifully.Women’s health issues to me are very important.That will make NAFTA look like a baby, and Wisconsin will be hit so hard.She’s on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about Trump University.But Drudge, 46 percent.Our party will have a very, very bright future.Thank you!AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS SO SMART AGAIN.AND NUMBER TWO -- AND HOW LONG WERE THE HOSTAGES THERE.And they wanted to make sure it got built.But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you.Thereâ€™s no way they can beat us.I’m trying to figure it.That’s with 15 people.If you donâ€™t mind, after Iâ€™m finished, if Weijia, or Hallie, or Vivian, or one of our female colleagues could go after me, that would be great.This guy follows me around, I’ll tell you.Would you have been firing back a little bit?You look at other economies â€” theyâ€™re doing terribly, and weâ€™re doing phenomenally.But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling.Okay?Yeah, go ahead.All I do is I’m going to be working for you folks.So come to America, where you can innovate, create, and build.Our country is doing so badly.And Hillary Clinton recently said about the vets that they’re being taken care of just fine.You know, one of the groups in Maine and it was like incredible.We have a tremendous – tens of millions of people in that position.It’s a complicated process.But weâ€™ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go.I have so many friends.If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, itâ€™s brutal.Nobody is going to be better than Ben.I mean, even CNN said, "Number one political story of the year is Trump."What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.These thugs, these animals walked in and they just go bomb, bomb, bomb.They’re not sending you.Right?Yeah, I have it upstairs…
Well, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer.OK, that’s nice.This is a really interesting process.But you want everybody to love you.You get shot or your child gets shot.Just like he didn’t know that Goldman Sachs and Citibank gave him money.Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.Impartial, free, and fair.And you know what?And we have, by â€” we picked up $10 trillion since my election.No, no, we’re going to make a great deal because that’s what happens.And you know, then they’re arrogant guys.Tom is asking "Can Jeb make a comeback?"I donâ€™t know her.THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE WATER SHED.Right?Secret Service went crazy.We’ve got a lot of problems.It’s a message of competence.If we donâ€™t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever â€” we are looking for the biggest ever â€” jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.Low-energy can be applied to Hillary.But every time there’s a protester "Well, I’m protesting" and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there.For the kind of money we gave them, they’re going to buy them.Cancel.You know, when you’re in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down.It’s not great again.Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the FIRST STEP Act.I read it.That’s even better than the original deal.Weâ€™re going to tax the cars that come in.Kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back.We’re taking from the Democrats.Certainly it didnâ€™t work out for our country.And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people.Thank you very much, everybody.It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.Now, our country could never do that because we’d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn’t let our country — we would never build in an ocean.That means education.I said, "Why aren’t you on Jay Leno?YOU SHOULD BE IN THE FRONT ROW.(Applause.)We used to have General MacArthur – Douglas MacArthur – General George Patton.And we have our anchors – I think I got them mostly stopped.And you know, it is a two-way street.They said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds.America will also be a safe society.She wants to take away Americans’ guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.But weâ€™ll get the infrastructure.But this reporter, who is a great intellect, actually, and a very smart guy, very good guy.We’re going to take care of our vets.He said "I think that’s the greatest compliment I can pay.We’re not going to be the stupid people anymore.Right?You know, again it would still not be horrible because you’re competing against a lot of very talented people that have been politicians all their lives.Weâ€™re going to put our auto industry back to work.And if we do these things, and if we care for and support each other, and love each other, then we will truly make America great again.I keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100.Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?I’ve been involved in many fundraisers.Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information â€” very important, very â€” I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain.But I have a judge who’s very, very unfair.I didn’t scream at him.What a crowd.And we’ll be back.Good job.War and peace â€” I always say, â€œWar and peace.â€  And after that, Supreme Court Justice.Thank you.Okay?We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us.But every single poll says – even CNBC’s poll said I won the debate.He calls people like for instance he said horrible things about the Speaker and you know about the Speaker and he said about separately Mitch McConnell.They want me to give them $1 million.So, thatâ€™s the story.But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we’ve got to make our economy strong.Totally knew about it.It’s a – think of it.We have to find out what’s going on.I agree.I’m going to spend money here.Very special.Very little debt.And again, I really think the press – look, the media, you know my opinion of the media.The Iowa is a much different kind of a thing.We’re not letting it happen, and we’re not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.We’re going to get — wait, wait, wait.We’re going to win with our military.He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region.Why?I watched that interview.See ya.I spent nothing, right?I also want to pay my respects to Ben Carson.So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.They’re good people.Now, they may be rejected with me, but itâ€™s going to be a quick rejection.That’s what’s going to happen.Our police are terrific.We donâ€™t have to talk about Reince.I never have been through anything like this but it’s a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold, and we’re going to make America great again.The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our countryâ€™s expense.You define it.And all of a sudden if somebody gets in that’s the wrong person, they’ll take away that Second Amendment so fast your head will spin.But he’s a low-energy person.I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally.TPP – Trans-Pacific Partnership.Right?This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight.If I don’t do it, CNN just makes a lot of money.You know, all of my life, I’ve heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013.And I speak to them â€” leaders of the countries â€” how are you doing?(Applause.)I never met these people.I didnâ€™t know we had that many.But we raised a lot and I’ll be raising more and we’ll be sending it to other people as we get along.That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.Allegations can go the other way also.It’s a much bigger – you know, very little debt, tremendous value.Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace.But he said on one of — I think it was on Fox, he was being interviewed.We’re going to do it, folks.And I disavowed then; I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, I disavowed again.But I saved this article.I mean give me a break.The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?So anyways you’ll be seeing that.(Laughter.)You people have all seen it before
I got along with everybody.What?Hereâ€™s the thing:  When I make a statement, I like to be correct.Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us.She reported it, instead of taking the money.Third, I think, was quite a bit away – I think 2,500 or something – close to 3,000 votes away.It’s false advertising.You know your bite is poisonous and now I’m going to die.’ ‘Oh shut up, silly woman,’ said the reptile with a grin.We must keep America first in our hearts.And if we’re not, we’re not going to have a country.But they’re not people that always talk to the press.I don’t know how his book is doing.Picture the new roads that will carve pathways all across our land â€” and we need them.I watch these generals being interviewed.It’s not supposed to be that way.He said he wants – he’s going to be a very negative person to guns because that’s the way it is, okay?Walmart, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler and General Motors have all announced that theyâ€™re keeping or adding tens of thousands of jobs right here in America.If you look at South Carolina, it’s the same thing.And the only reason weâ€™re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like theyâ€™re not going to be able to do.But the fact is, we are just getting started.Time Magazine -- Time Magazine last year did an incredible cover story.We have given to groups that are unbelievable groups.So you know it’s great.We had 250,000 people literally around â€” you know, in the little bowl that we constructed.But that's with 17 people.And I would have never given them $150 billion.But we hope weâ€™re going to be very much equally as successful.And I’m going to have more coming in over a period of time.And in 19 — and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said — and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we’ve ever had, and we need it more now than ever.He said, "They want to talk to you."Now, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he’s a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he’s built a fortune.And we are taking steps to make sure that our allies pay their fair share.Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, they’re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don’t have leaders that know how to say to China, "Don’t do that.I’ll tell you a little story.What’s my statement?Because if the Christians, and if the whole evangelical Christian sector gets together, nobody, nobody can beat –
You know, when I made the statement about banning Muslims on a temporary basis, I took such heat.If you’re not rich, that’s when you need the money, they don’t loan it to you.Iâ€™m just telling you, youâ€™re dishonest people.And they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of Republican primaries in terms of Iowa by far – not even close.It’ll be easier to take Todd and just say,

money.No, I mean, I think we’ll get a lot of Sanders’s voters.And thatâ€™s okay â€” as per the United Nations.A friend of mine builds plants.BANG.I donâ€™t want them to have problems, but they got to make a fair deal.I thought if we could get to $1 million, it would be great, which it would have been.He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.I SAID OH, THE POOR GUY HE IS GOING TO GET KILLED IN THE PAPERS.We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server.He gave 100%.They will love getting up in the morning.I’m giving the profits of my book – I’m giving them away to a lot of different – including the vets.These are great people.You have a problem with ISIS.Zero.Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.The voters are wise, and they are seeing straight through this empty, hollow, and dangerous game you are playing.They’re bringing crime.She was incredible.Finally.You know they had a little protest.I don’t know.We have Washington Times at 62 percent.She grabs me or hits me on the arm.Japan is devaluing their yen.No President has ever fought for us before.â€  And you really have to study whatâ€™s happened over the 15 years with the farm.And did you see her fall to the ground?One of the great musicians said "You get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar" meaning who doesn’t count on music.Dwight Eisenhower – we all like Dwight.Tens of thousands of people over the years.New York Times.Hillary said the same thing.But the motorcycle guys like Trump.Look at these charts.This is a great feeling.We are run by people that are so bad, they’re so out of their league — and I see it, I see it on the stage.This is people living in this country.Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.So we came up with Ivanka and my kids we came up with this incredible plan.And Syriaâ€™s a mess.I will tell you, final time â€” although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in â€” because I am coming back â€” weâ€™re going to have to get you a larger room.You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that’s being lost.And then another one would say, "You have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea."We got the sanctions on.If you want, you can.(Applause.)On policy after policy weâ€™re going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.And I hit a lot of people and they all went down.I’m running.And we’re going to save your Social Security and we’re going to save your Medicare.Believe me.We’re going to be tough and we’re going to be smart and we’re going to do it right.(Applause.)I went to the best business school in the world.What is Monmouth?He says it to everybody.It will go up.And we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals.IF SOMEBODY WERE UP THERE SCREAMING OR SHOUTING, THE CAMERAS, WHICH I USED TO THINK WERE IN A FIXED POSITION, I SAID MAYBE MECHANICALLY THEY CAN'T MOVE, BUT WHEN WE HAVE A PROTESTER, THEY TURN AND -- THEY ARE LIKE A PRETZEL ALL OVER THE PLACE.I said I’ll tell you what I’m going to do because you know they talk about free trade.One of the things weâ€™d save tremendous â€” just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.Common Core should — it is a disaster.There’s nothing.IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.They are calling me.We can’t beat ISIS.I mean, the numbers are crazy.So every time we order televisions, they come from South Korea, they make a fortune.Great job.So go back.In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls.Or a public hospital that’s in the area.I don’t even he’s got a high IQ…In

have unlimited.They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).I appreciate that.We need it.No, this is serious.I believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won’t be getting certain deductions which aren’t fair for them to be getting that they’ll end up doing better.And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States.But we will have a very good relationship I think with Russia.I mean, we’re having fun.First, our resources are totally over extended.Iâ€™ll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world â€” I will be criticized â€” Iâ€™ll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.Iâ€™ve been here for awhile.We have no idea who’s coming into our country.In fact, Clinton’s State Department was

you.WOW!Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq."A baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that."But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.IT'S SO IMPORTANT.So then a reporter said to me, "Why do you think that is?"Iâ€™m telling all the car companies, put a big label, â€œMade in the USAâ€ â€” itâ€™s going to stand for quality.We set up blue ribbon committees.We didn’t take the year.And all of you know Trump National Doral and weâ€™ll go there.It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest.He choked.For instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from

down and it’s a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in.Really, really productive conversations.But she committed a crime in my opinion.In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built.It’s got to be smart trade.We want to get the Gulf States to pay.I just want to bring you back to China for a second.I said, "Mark, I have to do this.And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions.And it all really took place because of Nashville, Tennessee.But to have a great success, you have to have women.What I want to clarify here first of all, I would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he’s concerned about veterans.We’re going to be here so much you’re going to get so sick of me.LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, IT IS TIME FOR A TOUGH TONE.We have to be smart.Americans already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on Earth, anybody in the world.Theyâ€™re taking down a lot of different testing areas.Yet while Hillary Clinton lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge funds â€” you know look what sheâ€™s doing with these hedge funds, raising millions and millions.No respect for this country or this president.He didn’t win anything.Until this whole thing, I didnâ€™t know him.And in between shots, I told you this after the victory speech, in between they have commercials and they were all about Trump.I don’t know Paul Ryan well but I hope to be able to get along with him.I want to bring jobs into this country.I donâ€™t talk about military response.And what they do â€” I know, itâ€™s sort of interesting â€” in one case, they say, â€œHeâ€™s a fascist.And let me tell you something.Very bad.Think of it, since Jan. 1.They throw down asphalt, and they throw.And then you’d go to South Carolina" where I’m leading by massive – yeah, you’ve got to see the rallies there.We’re leading in every single poll.WE'RE GOING TO TURN THEM AROUND FAST.And maybe that’s why I’m doing so well in the polls.In one year weâ€™ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case.U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.In fact, the young woman, who I hear was a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC â€” her mother wrote me and said through, I guess, Twitter, social media, the nicest things.Yes, go ahead.But not for us.I don’t want to do it for that reason.TAKE THE LUMPS.They’re not properly run.They’re right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in.And Iâ€™m going to be campaigning hard for their votes.Makes sense.Thank you.He’s left the race."On foreign affairs, weâ€™ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders â€” much of it youâ€™ve covered â€” to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.Thank you.That's it.So weâ€™ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.I helped John McCain and at that time, honestly, that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of collapsing.And certainly Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion.But he spent — think of it.You’ve got to look at some of the statements from the past.People are fed up.Great people.We didn’t have guns.No.They’ve got the 24-day – they have 24-day provisions.And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.It’s good.Tell me in five years.You know, the Persians are great negotiators.And you’re going to say, "That was the single greatest vote that I have ever cast", and you’re going to look back and you’re going to be proud of yourselves and you’re going to be proud of your country again.And, frankly, I then went on to other things.That was a terrible thing."And they wanted me to ride one and I said, â€œNo, thank you.â€  (Laughter.)So the head of Walmart, who I know â€” whoâ€™s a very nice guy â€” was making a political statement.So we’ll all consider it together.I’m wrong.All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make America strong again.And you know, one of the things I’m doing and last night was incredible.Wouldn’t it be nice to have a president that could just with his mouth make things happen that are positive?At the time, it was really something special.I’m not looking for credit.In fact, if I went opposite â€” I mean, they have somebody â€” Ann Coulter.Got to balance it.But Mike was literally â€” I had a group of â€” what, we had nine different people?We have to get rid of ISIS.U.S. News and World Report — 69 percent said I won the debate.These Departments refused to comply.We have a very serious situation.So we’ll be going there.And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me.And one of the things that is nice about the rates â€” the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know â€”

When President Obama had an economy that was â€” it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that â€” youâ€™ve all heard that.SPEECH 18: Remarks by President Trump and Vice President Pence at CIA Headquarters - Jan. 21, 2017

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I want to thank everybody.So weâ€™ll see.We’re going to be the smart people again.And I’m not supposed to be using hair spray.They closed down the city."KING RICHARD ENDORSED ME.It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.Already because of this new business climate, we are creating jobs that are starting to pour back into our country like we havenâ€™t seen in many, many decades.And we’re going to deal very humanely with the good people and they are mostly good people.Yet, Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical Islam," until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.Like three, four months ago.So again, I’m not doing that.So I wrote him a note, "Congratulations.And people were standing outside for hours trying to get in.THEY KNEW HE LEFT.I know the great business people.I did – everything was great.They want to marginalize us, they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, "Oh, gee."I’m controlled by you.World, I mean, countries that you wouldn’t believe are ahead of us.Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.THEY'VE REALLY RIGGED THE SYSTEM.A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING.I filed form A.They have no idea.And I disagree.I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on.And that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands.I go to these arenas, and they have signs all over the place â€” Heâ€™s kept his promise.Now, I know some people say I’m too much of a fighter.There’s no games.But we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have – health care, which is a mess.Nobody even knows.He’ll say.Thousands.Q    Two questions.But the Super PAC concept is corrupt.But, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me.But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military.We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.I have had more Syrians thank me for that.I don’t know what was going on.Was she jolted backwards?With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.Okay?So think of that.YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO ROUGH.It was a tremendous victory.The doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top.We will put new American steel into the spine of our country.It’s an honor to be with you.For those of you who don’t know him, he’s a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete.We’re losing many of our great companies.But it was a very substantial victory.This whole room would be filled up with hundred-dollar bills.The point is law enforcement – these people didn’t allow you to have any more people.So I donâ€™t want to rush into a statement.I’ll be honest with you.Theyâ€™ll even make it negative.I’m not, you know, like some of these guys where they’re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know and they’re nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country.And in those dark days fighting – right now all the tubes have been removed and I have a Do Not Resuscitate Order and I have a seven-year-old son – in those days in the hospital, I received from you a handwritten letter that said, "To the bravest woman I know."Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific woman.We get nothing.The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent.You know why?That’s what we’re going to do."The problem is, he speaks through the Applause.You know, if you look at Obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe thatâ€™s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform â€” not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things.Now, thatâ€™s not bad, but itâ€™s a lie.I wrote down notes about Wisconsin.Now, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big.I don’t know there was a lot of people.We’re going to work together for many, many years.But my wife said to me "You know if you run you will win.Every election year politicians promised change.What a crowd, what a crowd.The one bad thing is if I get in, the $150 billion is gone.With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country â€“ twice.It’s true.So, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared.(Laughter.)You look at what’s going on.Did he endorse?I THINK SO.Thank you very much.Weâ€™re going to get a good price, believe me.And again it’s called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they’re going to other countries, taking jobs.Who doesn’t?I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure.I REMEMBER DURING THE DEBATE THEY ASKED ONE OF THE FOLKS ON THE DEBUT STAGE WHO IS BECOMING FRIENDLIER AND FRIENDLIER BY THE DAY WITH ME, WHICH SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE RECOVERING.You know the word â€œtone.â€ The tone is such hatred.Itâ€™s one of the worst agreements Iâ€™ve ever seen drawn by anybody.Deals are made when parties come together.And we need steel and we need aluminum.Because something’s going on, and we can’t put up with it, folks.He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom.So I think, I have very little doubt, turnout weâ€™re going to have a tremendous Nov. 8.No, I don’t think so.WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points.We're building — we're building — I won the — which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing — probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services.We had 24,000 people.But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.Unbelievable.American cars will travel the roads.Are crying.Not assets."People that should have stepped up did not step up.I think we did very well.We want to simplify them to a tremendous level.So Mitt and--you just can't have those two.You’re very smart, tough people.Weâ€™re going to have one-on-one deals.Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.They have to end education of hatred.You catch a criminal and you have to release them.I wont the debate, right?But I like.AND WE WILL BUILD THE WALL.And the reason is people in this country are smart.During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African Americans throughout our country â€” throughout the world, if you really think about it, right?Tell you one thing, when sheâ€™s representing me I wouldnâ€™t do it anyway, but I can.Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty.I love Mexico.It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.Instead, it had tariffs – emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production.I remember when he was on the campaign trail, I was so nice to him.He doesn’t want any of our money."Okay?But you need smart people.We’ve got to be a country again.When I was called out on Mexico, I was â€” honestly, I was really, really surprised.It was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good, to make them look really good like the economy.And Obama definitely didn’t read it.SO -- AND I LIKE TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN PEOPLE SEE OR READ OR HEAR THINGS, THEY'LL SAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE -- PEOPLE SAY WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?But I think she’s afraid he’s going to say, "Listen, I don’t like her anymore.And everybody can be covered.I love you all!Iâ€™ve already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.In the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it’s a different world out there.In China 2,000 years ago, they built the Great Wall of China, which is bigger than any wall we’re thinking about, OK?And now all of a sudden they’re going into Syria.You have Lindsey Graham attacked me.When did we beat Japan at anything?And I’ve always heard if you’re a very successful person you can’t run for office, especially for president, and I see it all the time.People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.More importantly, weâ€™re going to do a great job, and then weâ€™re going to win it the old-fashioned way â€” weâ€™re just going to win it.Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nationâ€™s power and will to defend our people.I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's South Korea.But they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million.He’s not a natural born citizen.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.It’s called NAFTA.I said, no, I’m not doing three hours.I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.You know where their United States headquarters is located?And weâ€™ve proven that.They're coming for love?And I just spoke to him a little while ago.There are many, many points that weâ€™re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but theyâ€™re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them.And then I looked at poll numbers and I don’t mean polls where I’m winning; those numbers I like looking at.So, I’m in a different position than the other candidates because I’m the one candidate I don’t want any of your money; I want your support but I don’t want your money.I don’t do anything.When I sat with him, prior to going to office â€” going into office, he said to me thatâ€™s by far the biggest problem.And these characters come up, these politicians that I’m running against, "You don’t really think Mexico is going to pay for the wall?"We are rebuilding China.Weâ€™ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed.Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.We’ve got to straighten it out.According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal â€” and I happen to love the coal miners â€” down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.And we have raised a lot of money.But I said it.With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today.THEY HAVE THE MONEY.Why is that?It’s very simple.But now we’re going to see what happens.(Applause.)Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades.It was really long.The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs.If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said really — they're doing much better, the V.A.In this building, I have the largest bank in the world.Mexico is not happy.I’m not showing a big number in that.We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they’re great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.You have good-sized hands."Iâ€™ll be calling people, and weâ€™ll have people calling people that do this.You don’t sit down.We want to keep our country safe.Thank you very much folks.They don’t want our system.Not that I wouldnâ€™t, I just have nobody to speak to.The TPP even created a backdoor for China to supply car parts for automobiles made in Mexico.I just don’t know whether or not the voters appreciate it.But much more importantly, tomorrow, you get everybody you can and I promise you.Have you heard this?You’re going to destabilize the Middle East."Nobody was talking about illegal immigration.I’ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it’s horrible.Some guy has no money.And weâ€™re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent, and donâ€™t even collect it.That look there’s a sign – $100!So this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television.So we have to change.I would approve it so fast, so fast.They open the door.WE DON'T WIN ON TRADE.But they put a friend in there.Thank you all very much.Now I’m not doing that...






I’m not doing that to brag, because you know what?I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible.I’ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.Thank you.SO WE GET BERGDAHL, RIGHT, A TRADER.But, you know, it is possible somebody slipped — hey, we do have 11 million people in the country.That’s no young married couple.Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines.So, I mean, to me that’s the way it’s supposed to be.So itâ€™s going to be quick, itâ€™s going to be a very streamlined process.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.By the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons.Q    You waited two days â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I didnâ€™t wait long.Good poll.And believe me, weâ€™ve just begun.Then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.Level out the surface, let them play – if they had to play at all.Remember I said "Take the oil"?I did very well â€” great.But he can use my hotel.They’re not supposed to be doing that.The traffic, itâ€™ll be coming our way.There’s so little money left over for the candidates, it’s one of the reasons why I’m so happy I’m doing my own.THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.We have to go see them, go to talk to, have a meeting with them, "We love protecting you."Okay?We can say it nice and soft.She has it completely backwards.And it takes guts to run for president.We can’t beat ISIS....Q    With respect, sir â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  So this is â€” this is â€” and this is beyond Supreme Court.Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it’s not a lot of money but it’s great money.Q Yes, Mr. President, two questions â€”

THE PRESIDENT: No, no.THE PRESIDENT:   They donâ€™t decide policy.Believe me.If you take a look at some of the groups, and you see â€” and youâ€™d know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases youâ€™re not â€” but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.Remember the wise guy â€” remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people â€” the soâ€“called architect â€” the American people are stupid because they approved it?Tiny, tiny amount.I’ll tell you that’s an amazing and just an incredible story and we’re going to make sure that it goes as well as it can.Or are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to Hillary, they’re contributing to Bush.No tax, no nothing."We need new thinking.They’re incredible people.It’s a mess.Because when I did this stuff, it was very out there.A poll came out – a nationwide poll.Go back to them and tell them if they donâ€™t drop the suit immediately we are going to terminate the deal  You have great â€” you know, being President gives you great power, right?We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine.You know what?And all of these people were with their motorcycles in parking lots all the way.They can never, ever, ever come back.Sometimes I want to see him by himself.I mean, she wasn’t like – her face stayed the same.And you know what?So Prime Minister Abe gave me â€” I mean, itâ€™s the most beautiful five letter â€” five-page letter.I have to tell you.I can usually tell you that.I have a great team over here.Q    But, Mr. President, if I could follow up.I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unifier.And by the way, just to finish prisoners.Are we — yes, I guess the answer is certainly let’s not blame us.That’s with 16 people at the time.I want them to guess.You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically.No, I have no intention of changing my mind.But I mention it, now they don’t laugh because they’re starting to agree with me.We're going to bring our jobs back to this country.I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.All the nations of the world â€” friend or foe â€” will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.We are lifting people from dependence to independence, because we know the single best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck.It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax.You’ve got to be able to win.I got so angry at my people.Because you know, do you ever see what’s going on over there?So I know when youâ€™re telling the truth or when youâ€™re not.I just – I like the debates.You know, professionally written.Now, that’s like a magic act.Let her have her day in court.Will it be focused on specific countries?Saudi Arabia, Cuba, China.And Iâ€™ve been good at it.I am a conservative.Q    â€” the women of the country.Few can understand your pain.THE PRESIDENT:  I am prepared.But, you know, I’m very happy with it.We’re the smartest people, we’re the most loyal people, and you know what I’m happy about?THE PRESIDENT:  Oh boy, itâ€™s going to be â€”

Q    Where is it?The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.Much prefer.Our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt.We will make America rich again.Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world – Saudi Arabia – we protect everybody.But one of the things we’re going to do with the VA, we have a lot of hospitals that aren’t doing any business.Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund – the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese – all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return.(Applause.)Those hats are amazing.And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense.Nobody talks about it.Great.You know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn’t even a word anybody knew and now it’s like routine.(Applause.)He’s got an amazing future.One by one â€” youâ€™re reading about it, right?I don’t want to settle the case.He’s a great champion.Thank you.It’s not going to happen.When you want a television set, who do you get it from?We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.But I do congratulate Ted because I know how hard Ted worked on Texas and it’s a big get.They want to throw their placards at CNN.You can end the drug problem.People would say, "Is that good or bad?"A lot of people don’t know.I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta.Very nice.Q Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would.We’re not going to approve as somebody just said the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a disaster – a disaster – for our country.I mean, if you think of it, you can’t say "Merry Christmas" anymore.But mostly, itâ€™s going to be an acceptance.And they don’t talk jobs and they don’t talk China.So, a few things.It’s all done.We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs, very simple.THE PRESIDENT:  They wouldnâ€™t do that for me, Judah.It’s the cheapest thing we can do.As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.I don’t know.Meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and hate the Jews.They’re actually running the campaign.Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what’s going on in this country.They donâ€™t put America first.We are going – and remember this – we are only going to have great trade deals.So many small business owners here, I know five of them.THEY ACTUALLY WOULD RATHER PAY MORE TAX, WHICH IS SURPRISING, AND GET RID OF THESE REGULATIONS THAT ARE CHOKING EVERYBODY.I want to, sir, ask you â€” you always talk about â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, you said where?Okay?Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders.You have all these places and there’s hundreds of people.I have some on MSNBC.I love the poorly educated.We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers.You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing.What happens when Iâ€™m dealing with the problems in the Middle East?We don’t win anymore.Can you believe it?And everybody agrees it should come home – the Democrats, the Republicans.You know, first thing I did I announced.Thank you very much!It’s going to be one of the highest rated shows ever.I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down.They don’t want us there.We’re going to bring our jobs back from China.As I have said, the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries.Jeb Bush gets caught because he is such a nice person.So in one case youâ€™re talking about highly classified information.Isnâ€™t that easier, though, than settling for like $4 billion seven years from now?"Come over here.As Trump, I can say I’ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won’t stop.But these guys run for office.He refuses to use the term.Heâ€™s a tremendous genius.Everything she touched, it just didnâ€™t work out.Enough.Our biggest victories are still to come.They see me walking down the street and they go "Hey, hey, hey."Because the people the people know.Would anybody be surprised?But in the evening, they’d go out and they’d have dinner together with their families.So he wanted to steer away from the Hispanics.But I met him and I said, he is so good.I think we’re going to do very well.He left.They’re going to have Yemen.They know him very well.I mean, we get nothing.We love South Carolina.But we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare.They did not know if they would survive the hour.You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where I’m leading.It was an NBC poll.Great story you put into a newspaper.â€  Essentially, now weâ€™ll go and investigate that group.And you know what?Q    No, Iâ€™m not forgetting about it.You know what I gave?There was one little group of – despite global warming – you know, you hear about "It was so cold."Look at what we did in Iraq.THE PRESIDENT:  Congratulations on the purchase.Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.How could it be possible?Because if you do that, we’re going to put a big fat tax on you.Seven: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.You’ve got to do it.You like him?They’re not stupid.I intend to find out.Well, no, look.(Applause.)But tell me in five years you’re going to feel good about Boeing because I’ll tell you what’s happening.But it’s a six-year statute.Within 24 hours, they call you and they say, "You’ve got your prisoners."And I’ll never forget – I saved the article.Just remember that.Trump doesn’t want money therefore we can’t – even though he’s better than all these guys, even though he’s going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that.I’m angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with China.They were really incensed and they couldnâ€™t believe it.You spent a fortune on polls and you don’t report your own polls because I’m winning by a lot."Many of them have – I guess you found $2 million or $2.5 million where they talked.What they do is unbelievable, how bad.When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama.YOU COULD LOOK AT THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, AND IT IS SMALL POTATOES.But and it’s so important.His shameless lies and deceptions, dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax, is one of the main reasons we are here today.What happens someday later â€” but I can tell you that I donâ€™t forget.(Applause.)We don’t want that stuff.And if you want, press, I think we told you before we’d be okay if you want to ask a few questions.And Wolf Blitzer asked me a question on television.I’m not controlled by anybody.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.You know, they’re ordering Komatsu tractors now because they’ve devalued – look, you take a look at what’s happened to the Yen and it’s very hard.And I was explaining about the numbers.I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows.But we have to start rebuilding our country.We’re going to cherish each other.We are born free and we will stay free.This has not been my life turning down money.And he has offered his services, and itâ€™s something we may take advantage of.Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; it’s got to be that way.We said "Don’t do it.It is time.You watch.I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest.How cool is that?But they asked me â€” I said I think itâ€™s going to be a two-state.And the veterans – I don’t know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying "Where are the people?"Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.He has no energy.I negotiate.We got nothing but problems.In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that I’m buying which is only a couple of blocks.No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that.And what it means is you have the wrong leader.He’s at two.It’s not going to be – you see that ceiling?But I have a great family and I built a great business.Iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times.And I watch the speeches.You saw it.Mobile, Alabama – 35,000 people.I believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together.Not going to happen.I get bills from people; I’ll negotiate.The crowd is spellbound.They don’t know how to go about making a deal.No good.A Trump Administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure.They know they’re crooked, they know they’re dishonest and they really — otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me?We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time.I filed papers.But I wanted to have it made.WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.You don’t mention all the other names.One of them was Herman Zeitchik.And we have some good people.And I thank you...
I’m going to win.If the press writes false stories like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile.They just announced yesterday theyâ€™re moving their small car division, the whole thing, into Mexico.In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.Think of it, youâ€™ve never seen â€” youâ€™ve covered very well â€” youâ€™ve never seen this happen.So we now call him Lyin’ Ted – Lyin’.We need victories in this country.But on the wall, they skimped.We have to look to new people.We had a bad decision.That will stop.Even the generals have to have some power over them.And thatâ€™s when I found out these polls are rigged.What kind of country will we leave for our children?Would anybody like that long, beautiful chart?And heâ€™s going to be â€” I think heâ€™ll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.Our country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems.That was done for politicians so they’d look good.He said, "No, no, it makes no difference.â€œThis is so-and-so calling forâ€¦â€ â€” he took the call.I then had a second conversation that has been misquoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently misrepresented....It’s so sad to see what’s happening to our country and we’re going to turn it around and we’re going to change it.One of his first questions, sir, how much will you be charging us?Iâ€™ve ended much of it â€” most of it.(Laughter.)Do you know that everybody said "Oh, Japan.When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low â€” itâ€™s never had a period of time like this.What did I give them?But he agrees with everything I'm saying.My Christians are liking me a lot lately and they’ve been great.I am totally self-funding my campaign other than small donations because people send in small donations for $10, $15, $20...






No, no, that’s merchandise sales.I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they’re representing countries that are ripping off the country, they’re representing companies that are ripping off our country.Twitter is on @BarackObama's enemies list <URL>I mean, all over the place.So, I don’t know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run – Scott was mentioning before – "One of the amazing things about you, you’ve never run for office before.The people are incredible.There is still more fighting and work to be done and to consolidate our gains.We’re losing all over the world with trade deals.They have no choice.No, it doesn’t have to be privatization.How do you like him?Now, let’s take some questions.They’re going to get Syria.We have great people in our nation.Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.But the press loves to bring up the name â€œAnn Coulter.â€  And you know what?What have I given, other than some time?On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time.They are totally controlled by the money.AND HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE GUY BUT HE GOT A LITTLE BIT ROUGH.What happened?42%.We’ve had incredible response.Q    You were prepared for questions.Yamiche is my former colleague, and we miss her.I had no choice.We’re not building.I’m a very loyal person.I was doing it sarcastically – I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right?We don’t win with trade.This is the place where the â€œMain Street of Americaâ€ got its start, and this is where Americaâ€™s main street will begin its big, beautiful comeback that â€” you are seeing it right now.Iâ€™ll do you next.I don’t care.Don’t sit back and say, oh, Trump is going to do well.No matter where we go -- I went to Mobile, Alabama -- 35,000 people.You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk.Everything okay?Some of them I do.And I told the Mexicans, I said, â€œWe have to keep companies.â€  But theyâ€™re getting a lot, also.I’m the only one putting up my own money, other than – I know it’s precious – people write in to DonaldJTrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20.The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.Thatâ€™s okay.Did he say that?But you know what?The last box is $50 million or more.And in Nevada, I think I got 37% and leading everybody.That’s a lot of merchandise sales.Donald J. Trump is calling for – now, you’ve got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it’s common sense and we have to do it.They’re good men.Nobody ever talks about them.And people are making the statements they’ve never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized.Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan.You’ll see it later.Theyâ€™re fake.When I have somebody that’s not on my side, when you know – by the way, I’ve gotten great applause from the press in terms of as an achievement because the Republican Party is really well unified.He actually gets very unfair press in that regard.You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find.They don’t want people pouring in.I watched Romney.I will tell you that.Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record.You people know.I want to thank you very, very much.We are so far behind the eight ball in this country.Go ahead.These are very talented, very good people.You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made â€” probably even worse than NAFTA, if thatâ€™s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.AND HE'S ACTUALLY A QUALITY PERSON.We're bringing our jobs back.GET TO BUSINESS.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.Yes, the motor industry.Weâ€™re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.I’m not going to tell anybody what to do.Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians.And here’s, you talk about twisted, here’s another twisted part: testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made!And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.Incredible energy.And I just noticed, I did it again.I thought that was terrible.Yes?We have these little walls.You look at what’s going on with everything.The job is under budget, ahead of schedule.A lot has been accomplished.Okay?We’re not going to let Carrier make air conditioners, fire all of its people, move to Mexico, make the air conditioners then come in and take the money out of the country.TRUMP: Even her former Secret Service agent, who’s seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president.And the budget was over $1 billion, right?Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.They don’t pay what they should be paying for not having to have this massive military apparatus that we supply.I think, probably, two-state is more likely.Here’s the story.And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.Weâ€™ve delayed this â€” meaning the Republican senators, not me.We came very close with healthcare.THE PRESIDENT:  We have to help them.The other bad things are ISIS.So we need people — I’m a free trader.We’re going to stop drugs from coming into New Hampshire.In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him.How does it happen?And it’s an honor to have everybody here.They didn’t talk about it as positively as they should have.I can just say that what he said was a lie.I mean, it’s taken off like crazy.(Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.Think of it:  India can double their coal production.She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her.THEY DON'T STOP.Oh, look at these magnificent floors."Itâ€™s a very big problem, thereâ€™s no question about it.THE PRESIDENT:  Please sit down.An incredible company; a wonderful company.I mean, people know that.But Iâ€™ve been watching them for a long time.The next day, I picked up the papers.Not always.But he’s a special guy and he really has helped.All certified checks.Then they’re make — they’re going to make product and they’re going to sell it into the United States?I LOVE NASCAR.WE DON'T HAVE STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRY.It canâ€™t get any worse.It’s coming from more than Mexico.I’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s eyes.But women are incensed at whatâ€™s going on.I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever met him.They’re fed up with incompetence.The potential is enormous.I think youâ€™ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point â€” as bad as it is â€” not an end point.Thatâ€™s easy.Then Kate was killed in San Francisco and Jamiel was killed in Los Angeles.I bring it up because that’s the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back.SO HERE IS WHAT I WOULD SAY.Like I mentioned corporate inversion.Thank you, darling.No, you see, I was making this speech and everybody stood up – make America great again… But nobody stood up to them.Right?Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts â€” but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea.Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.Chaos!We’re going to take care of our veterans.Weâ€™ve been restrained.We have 50 million people in poverty.But they hit.$50 million or more.So someday, someday they’re going to understand, someday when we take it all, they’ll understand.Whoâ€™s a vet?I mean, it’s sort of interesting because I see when I turn on the television, I see these ads about myself by crooked people.But really now we’re starting.But the ones that I find â€” I mean, I have men that donâ€™t like it, but I have women that are incensed at whatâ€™s going on.Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.You don’t give them $1 million.Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another â€“ but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.We owe $21 trillion in the very near future.She will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career.Nobody can do that like me.I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed.It’s going to be a negotiation where we’ll start at certain levels and hopefully I will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the American people.It’s going to be straightened out tough and it’s going to be straightened out fast.JUST REMEMBER THAT.We’re going to make our military so big and so strong and so great.Theyâ€™re bad people.Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some — for many, many — for millions of women.I really do.It’s become more diverse.So it says "$50 million or more".Beada, where are you Beada?Just like I should have gotten the Emmy for The Apprentice for the first three years.And this is money.No more release, no matter who you are â€” release.Q    It sounds like what youâ€™re saying is, there is a situation, there is a scenario under which you would withdraw Brett Kavanaughâ€™s nomination.I havenâ€™t given anything.â€  And weâ€™re really onto the cusp.Always China.Okay?A new national pride is stirring our souls."You’ve got to say this.And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.It’s not like you have the Republicans here and you have – everybody agrees.We had a tremendous gathering of people – thousands – I don’t know how many thousands – but many thousands of people.Weâ€™re going to try and fix as quickly as possible â€” you know it takes a long time.I also look very forward to what Judge Kavanaugh has to say.And actually during one of the debates, Marco Rubio looked over and he said, "You’re a liar."And it wasnâ€™t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be.So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty.You’ve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.We have the leverage.But we are appealing that and we are going further.One case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation.To help support working parents, the time has come to pass School Choice for Americansâ€™ children.We’re going to win at the border."We want a lot."I talk about — trust me.You know, we’re talking about a year and more actually.You know, Walker used – I said, "Make America great again."What we’ve been doing has been incredible.This is an amazing tradition.Very true.THE PRESIDENT:  Because theyâ€™re not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country.Now, here’s the other thing.The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it.This was Rubio that said, "He has small hands and you know what that means."No matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes.USA!We have the best business people in the world.Probably a guy who couldn’t get women.It’s so terrible.And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition.So you know, welcome to the world of the media.Americans for Equal Living – $100,000.As you know, you’re not allowed to have anything to do with them.And it talked about â€” you saw it, front page.THE PRESIDENT:  You know what?Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.That’s good environmentally.He began by imagining the benefits a railroad could bring to his port [part] of Illinois â€” without ever having seen a steam-powered train.Most of importantly, favorability – no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%.When they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back.And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.Mr. President, you said you feel a kinship â€” you said you feel a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh and you â€” Mr. President, really quickly, you said you felt a kinship with Brett Kavanaugh.The political people arenâ€™t doing so well but you.But they’re being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen.I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.I WANT TO TELL YOU, A LOT OF BERNIE SANDERS PEOPLE ARE SO UPSET ABOUT IT, THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR TRUMP.WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN IRAQ.People can’t do those kind of stuff.We have a movement like they have never, ever seen in this country.It only has to do with your attempt to undo the election of 2016 and steal the election of 2020!They’re all over the place.We’re going to take care of each other.22Kill got $200,000.I said, â€œWhat have we done?That’s all she got.And we owe them money.Weâ€™re doing it the right way.But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation.African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans.OK?I think you would do much better by being different.Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?(Applause.)You had a – what was that all about?SPEECH

Wow.So, we are going to do things and this country right.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world.They’re not sitting.Remember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat?More.What could be in Florida?I’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country – remember it, folks, remember it.Not only does this cost our economy billions of dollars, but it also denies our citizens the safe and modern infrastructure they deserve.And I don’t want to put these really bad dudes – I mean, they are bad – I don’t want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years.And I think one of the reasons I am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons I’m doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking.And I’m reading, and I want to see.America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.Big, big contributions are being made by countries that werenâ€™t doing so much in the form of contribution.They go through areas where you have no wall.These are people that have deceived us.The United States is leading a very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding, and to discredit their wicked ideology.He balanced the budget.We’re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class.So, we have to be taken care of.We don’t get anything out of anything.I’m the only one that’s honest about this thing.AND REMEMBER THIS.I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.It didn’t stop.Let me be clear.And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi.Thank you.I mean, I’m not even blaming it – Obama’s the worst.But you know, they show those phony statistics where we’re 5.4% unemployment.We all salute the same great American flag.Thank you very much, Mr. President, for being with us.…But you know, if you think about it and you’ll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what.Not too many?The parents, the teachers.A great poll.We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.But there is more to Hermanâ€™s story.Go ahead.We cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries.Almost $400 billion a year.Okay?SPEECH 8: Trump Letter to Pelosi on Impeachment - Dec. 17, 2019

I write to express my strongest and most powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade being pursued by the Democrats in the House of Representatives.This time I said I’m doing it myself, okay?But if you send it back it’s totally insulting.Right?I’ve had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me.We start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor.Would have been easy.And they are in very big trouble, I have to tell you.Q    Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir?Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando.We’re going to do it.Good....Emerson poll came out.See this ceiling?I wanted to brag.It’s a crime.Heâ€™s a great intellect.But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.(Applause.)They’re very good.These are the stats.But let me just explain â€”

Q    But why make the charges now â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no.They shouldn’t be talking.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you....I can’t believe this number but I read it over – who is the man that told me the number – over 6 million people – I can’t believe it – are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security...But I heard it.We have incompetent leadership.We’re going to have numbers are going to be so good.We owe $19 trillion.We can do other things with the money.January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.You know, they go into unfriendly territory, and the champ, he goes in.I was supposed to be Person of the Year on Time Magazine.We have no idea if they want to bomb us.I’m in competition with them.Anything.No, I’m not.Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States.Theyâ€™re being thrown out of our country.Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.And honestly, if the press were not fake, and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice.I’m the opposite.Our vets are being treated so unfairly.Increase the sanctions.We’re going to be great to the vets.And then â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  A lot.So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.By the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare.The deductibility – unless you’re close to death, you’re never going to use it.She’s not going to win.And just while youâ€™re at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Timesâ€™s story yesterday.They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest.I think she has made a tremendous mistake.The United States is respected again.And we give them $150 billion and we don’t even get our prisoners back.And we have just gotten started.Because our country doesn't win anymore.I have everybody, and so many friends.Don’t sit at the table.You think theyâ€™re friendly â€” although the best ad I ever had was one done against me by Hillary â€” it was so good, I said I hope she keeps running that ad.It was good.And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.Well, I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders, to be honest with you.Whatâ€™s going on?We can't be the stupid people anymore.I raised close to $6 million.And you’re going to look back on this evening and you’re going to say that was one of the great evenings of your life because we love the country.And you have seen whatâ€™s happening with regulations â€” theyâ€™re going fast.She’s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world — true weakness.And you know, my life has been about winning.I think itâ€™s, in one way, more difficult because itâ€™s a real estate deal â€” because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carveouts and lots of everything.You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you’ve got to vote.And I think when the press portrays it differently, the press is being very dishonest.I don’t know if you heard what’s happening.It is so terrible.Oh, so complicated.I don’t think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they’re not silent.They didnâ€™t know the location.The World Economic Forum community, who is assembled here, will be certainly â€” and I quote you from the last piece of your remarks â€” will be certainly among â€œthe hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day making this world a better place for everyone.â€

Thank you very much for being with us.One of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making.NO.They did it for us.So, we’ve got a long way to go.Can you believe this?It’s loaded up.And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.Our factories will be moving again.And number two, they didnâ€™t have the capability to do it.He didn’t even know.But so I had a great experience.A LOT OF THE GUYS ENDORSED ME.He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, "Donald, we’re renewing The Apprentice.We have rebuilt China.Now, hereâ€™s the thing: If we make a deal, they wonâ€™t have to pay.So I grew up in that environment.I’m cutting taxes.We are laughed at by the rest of the world.Without the ban, weâ€™d have a bigger problem.A great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while.I wasnâ€™t a fan of Iraq.I think we’d run the table.Everybody was saying he should be on the Supreme Court.We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it.It’s not going to happen anymore.Wow, that’s a lot of them – it’s like the Academy Awards.Itâ€™s really incredible.It’s very tough.By the way, speaking of it, we’re going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody’s ever going to mess with us again.And a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in China — he’s a great guy.He’s a fantastic person.What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan.Yes.Iran is taking over Iraq.BUT AS BAD AS THEY WERE, THEY GET BROADCAST ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR DAYS AND DAYS, AND ALL OF THE GOOD THINGS WHICH ARE MAGNIFIED THOUSANDS OF TIMES, NOBODY TALKS ABOUT.Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.When are we going to come back, "We beat Japan"?They’re going to a private doctor.HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.Theyâ€™re actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and theyâ€™ve destroyed a manâ€™s reputation and they want to destroy it even more.They had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there’s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there’s nobody there.Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.But it does.So, he started it.Irredeemable.THE PRESIDENT:  I didnâ€™t wait long.And weâ€™re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.So Sweden and Norway and China and others are the best....That’s their choice.THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE BORDER.Wipes her server clean, that's OK?I tell you that.Itâ€™s just a lie.We can’t have the free rides any more, folks.You have somebody coming on who is extraordinary.TAKE A WHILE -- THEY WILL STILL COME BACK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.(Applause.)I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai.Just blocks away is the Empire State Building.But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody.And that guy has no money.And by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world.I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine.And here’s what’s going to happen.THEY GO TO MUSEUMS WHERE THEY HAVE SIMILAR PLANES, AND THEY STRIP APART TO USE FOR OUR FIGHTER PILOTS TO FLY.Itâ€™s common sense.I’m doing this because I just had a beautiful grandchild with Ivanka.If you donâ€™t have a border, you donâ€™t have a country.And they say it, and everybody understands it.They will love earning a big, fat, beautiful paycheck.How do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent?So important.Right?The money goes out daily.I said "No, no, tell me please."But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.My wife says, "Darling, the speech was excellent.And maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I’m saying.You know, I was stopping â€” when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops.Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California.You say who negotiates a thing like that?Feel so guilty.If that happens in Mexico, they don’t even know what you’re talking about.But some of the Super PACs are running campaigns.We’re going to do it, and it’s going to happen fast.The office is called VOICE â€” Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.Just got this.And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know.…You know, we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country.It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned.Massive.And I’m looking, I’m watching this on television – ad after ad.I understand.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.Now, it’s going to open probably in September of ’16 right before the election on Pennsylvania Avenue.But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it’s a statistic that’s full of nonsense.And they showed Hillary Clinton – hers is very close.60,000.(Applause.)So our country is doing very well, economically.You're not going to get--unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage.Right?And itâ€™s had no impact on our â€” absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldnâ€™t.She sort of has said them, but let’s see what happens.Not NBC.It’s been really incredible.In this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else.I’ve built a great company.I WOULD HAVE SAID, REMEMBER, NICE AND EASY.Carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, Black, white and Hispanic.Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that.They did it for America.THE PRESIDENT: No, no, look.We had people that didnâ€™t know what they were doing.And one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies.On the budget, I mean, I understand — the budget, the economy, I win — I win it hands down, all right.(Applause.)Now, I’m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to.So we are not going to have deals like that with me.I don’t think they’re going to be doing it.Thank you.Do they do this for their brand?But everybody said without question in every poll – this isn’t just here – that the people that are with Trump are with Trump.Right?A lot of times, they will say, well Mr. Trump’s people are blue-collar.So many people — it’s just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.I hope to be able to get along with everybody.But Iâ€™m different than those people.AND NOW SHE WANTS TO GET RID OF IT.Very importantly.I see it.(Applause.)America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker.Now, in the meantime, weâ€™ve vetting very, very strongly.And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe.But we need law and order.Now, yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different.Very good with President Moon.SPEECH 6


Thank you.Carl Icahn endorsed me, so many others have endorsed me.Do you trust?You know, my how life I’ve been a business, I’ve been a developer.Crowds like this?The Old Post Office.Q    What would it be for?They want to see borders.This morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in.We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable.It’s true.The other candidates, most of them don’t even know about it.We want them to be our allies.100% or 99%?American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.(Laughter.)You look at the horrible, horrible, horrible Iran deal.We have to be strong.And we're going to have an incredible convention.When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders.(Applause.)Itâ€™s one of his big things that weâ€™re going to be looking at.It’s going to be fine.So, it wouldnâ€™t have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score.Then they said, "Well, he’ll never sign his financial statement because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks."Not going to happen anymore, folks.Donald Trump.But we donâ€™t control our own border.By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem.We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.It’s not their thing.You give them $150 billion.Thatâ€™s what it is.I walked up Fifth Avenue.He’s got very, very tough immigration policies.I say, why is this guy spending all this money?But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people â€” the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.Q    Just to be sure, I know you were pointing to me, but I work for PBS NewsHour.Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I’m not elected President, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that’s why I’m going to be elected president folks.I mean, everything I say he agrees with me."Oh, okay.Hopefully, they’re going to call it the Spring of Trump and I want the next Autumn of Trump.Aliceâ€™s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing, and the need to remedy this total injustice.Not a lot come out.Maybe everybody.He said, ‘Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.’ I didn’t say that.It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel.We get that because we have people that don’t know what they’re doing in Washington for many years.I don’t want my generals on television saying "Well, ISIS is very tough."And we don’t even get our prisoners back.Every week they come out with a new poll.Thank you.The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this â€” they know nothing about it.We’ve had an amazing time today.And they were dancing.I love Israel.We need that kind of thinking.But most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or they’re bankrupt.And I love you all and thank you very much.Since I’ve raised that criticism and it’s OK. I’ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details — NATO has since announced a new initiative — front page of the Wall Street Journal four days ago focused on just that.It’s really with the mouth, the heart, and the brain.And the Los Angeles Times has us 6 points up nationwide.You know, it takes guts.Okay?Take a look at your security, take a look at the wages.So I really appreciate it.The same thing is happening there.It blew up.We’re going to keep—as you know Gitmo, we’re keeping that open, and we’re going to load it up with bad dudes.And when they change it and make it really bad â€” something that should be positive.ALL OVER.Thank you very much!YOU CAN'T EVEN WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.Beautiful children â€” wonâ€™t be seeing their father again.And then we have another coming where we’re doing well.She doesn’t have the strength or the energy.He sets up a Trump something PAC.I think the political press is among the most dishonest people I’ve ever met, I have to tell you that.What he went – for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did.(Applause.)And then we give them money.They’re being funded by the oil that I said take.Q But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?And one thing and I think you’ll all admit it.I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.I was going to do one really wild but he agrees.You’re all focused on the way he’s raising money and you’re not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday.So Canada has a long way to go.And we don’t win anymore.So we don’t know.I’m a presbyterian.And then I had to hit her back, so I hit her back and I talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse — no, it’s tremendous abuse.Because Iâ€™ve had it many times.TRUMP: Thank you.Heâ€™s got the easiest job in government.Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody.And Iâ€™ll tell you something, Iâ€™ll be honest â€” because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but Iâ€™ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.This was an example of it today.What I did – I didn’t ask Al.They were having – things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years.The only way they win the fight definitely – knock out.One-third of counties only have one Obamacare insurer left.Might also be 32 million.And they just pour off the ships.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.Caesar’s went bankrupt.People canâ€™t believe it.But I spent essentially no money.I talk about commerce.Itâ€™s time right now to end it.Our nominees from Montana and Kansas are here with us this evening â€” Greg Gianforte and Ron Estes.I told them I’m not doing it, and then they finally believed me when I actually announced.(Applause.)Maybe less.Look, we have a big, big day.But once we were there, I said "Look, we shouldn’t have been there.They’re tougher than all of us these people.And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense.I never met them.If you look â€” the hatred.His is a different kind of book and he’s a different kind of a person.Clint Black.THE PRESIDENT: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 oâ€™clock in the evening.Not even close.Maybe not you, Jon.We lose everything.Well, generally speaking, that’s 100% true.We will make America proud again.A few things – I want to bring up a few new subjects.Do you see this?Does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done?And this is not from South America.I ran on a very simple slogan: â€œMake America Great Again.â€  If youâ€™re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if youâ€™re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we donâ€™t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.And I’m going to build our military bigger, stronger than ever before.It traveled along the Lincoln Highway â€” called then the Lincoln Highway.WE'RE NOT USED TO IT.In other words, I’ve won one out of 32 states," and you do what Marco did, which was great, and you do what Rand Paul did, and you do what a lot of them did, and you get out.(Laughter.)You know I've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful.Are we going to take down â€”

Excuse me, are we going to take down statues to George Washington?You know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it â€” but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes.And they had 23 murders.And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status.Over the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S.  Weâ€™re lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream â€” the dream of a great job, a safe home, and a better life for their children.Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.We have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted.But the $150 billion is gone because it’ll be gone before you get there.Q    You were prepared.SO WE'RE GOING GET THE GULF STATES WHO HAVE SO MUCH MONEY, FOLKS.$2.5 billion, it’s going to be one of the largest in the world.But we have a lot of people coming – lots of congressmen.FAR WORSE.Somebody said, "You shouldn’t say stupid.(Applause.)And in South Carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability – you know, I’m the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say – I think I had one poll where I’m 41% – almost 41% – can you imagine?That’s absolutely false.We are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world.And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against and he’s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that’s what I do.You can’t move.I will not back down from defending our country.We don’t know who they are, they have no documentation and we don’t know what they’re planning and we won’t unless we have proper supervisor and proper leadership in which case they’re out of here.So I have 20,000 people.Don’t do that.How dare you say I’m brilliant?They're taking it out.Do you think these guys – I’m not going to say Carson – I’m not going to say Rubio, who really is way down – I mean, I am second.I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting-edge industries of the future.OH, THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL WAY OF LIFE.I love Tea Party.They’re out of all sorts of crap.((Laughter and applause.)And weâ€™re going to lift the restrictions on American energy â€” which means at least another half a million jobs each year.And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons.Now, that’s probably not the only reason it didn’t happen.Let’s face it.The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country.People are amazing.Tom Brady – I think what they’ve done is terrible.This was people writing letters.Great guy.15 years ago with my friends from Israel because I have a lot of friends from Israel, they used to smile and laugh "Oh, don’t worry about it."One country came in to see me recently â€” big country, good country, great person.It’s wrong.Nabsico – home of the formerly wonderful Oreo which we don’t eat anymore.Believe me, they will pay.Why aren’t we creating a nice big circle so they can’t get the oil out?THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I did.Everybody’s writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they’re talking about it.There was a word – two words that used to be used a lot called "silent majority".And then I started speaking.They don’t know anything about – they never read the Art of the Deal, first of all.We need them.I’ve heard this so many times before with the daycare and everything else.Two: I’m going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.But we told him he can’t do that.I know guys that you haven’t heard of that honestly are phenomenal.Absolutely.You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that.We love you.In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses.But to do these things you need a lot of energy.You see the bridges.And they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks, we have made them that way.From jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price â€” to so many other things, even military protection.Q    Is the alt-left as bad as Nazis?Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists.Your head will spin probably.Theyâ€™re not going to turn out.Fifty-six?I’m a great dealmaker.And we end up doing almost $6 million.One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast.Look, folks, folks, folks, you know, you have to trust – there has to be some trust.We didn’t win anything.We will never let that happen.So, what I said a couple of days later ... and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, "Mr. Trump, you have strong hands.They don’t love me so much anymore.Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.You know, we get the biggest crowds.I don’t need the rhetoric.It’s great to be in a wonderful city, New York.Not thrilled, I’d like to be that — over that 50 mark, but I think we’re doing really well.And this is the kind of mindset you need.I’ll be the greatest unifier of all.And when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration.He hates Obama.Nobody believes you’re going to run."Because you know, we’ve got men, we’ve got women.It’s really not to be believed.They probably won’t be in business in two years.Don’t do it."Weâ€™re going to apply intelligence.I’m just doing what’s right.And I don’t want to skip Iowa.You look at all the companies that are moving out.So I think it was a disgrace, but thatâ€™s the way the press is.(Applause.)The poll said 49% to 14% and 15%.He’s got to hit me first.It had to be a record.Okay?And our politicians donâ€™t do anything about it.If we could get along with Russia, thatâ€™s a positive thing.Nothing in our country works anymore.Okay?He said, "You know, I make great product."My theme is Make America Great Again.If they had guns, you wouldn’t had that carnage.But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out what’s going on.Together, we will put the American people first again, first again.Everyone else is controlled.What — what’s going on there?How does this kind of immigration make our life better?A lot of people don’t even know we have all the power.We love you.And I said, "We’re going to do things."There’s something going on that we don’t know about.It wasnâ€™t even in the papers.(Applause.)He’s an insider totally but he can get nothing done.So, and I have a lot of employees.But you take a look around the world, socialism is not exactly riding high.I mean, think of it.Itâ€™ll take your jobs, Ohio.We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and admirals.I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.So we sent legal notices to every one that we could find.Some of us will re-negotiate deals.America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder.We came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders.They call us the dumb Americans.And he takes me — and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage — and then I killed him.Whereâ€™s South Carolina?But a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect – many of them, not all of them – but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls.That’s a part of the problem.So we’re going to take care of our vets.This is a movement.Nothing.(Applause.)Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.Torrential rains and terrible flooding continue to pose a grave danger to life and to property.We’re leading in every poll.Don’t watch."Look at Congressman Nadlerâ€™s challenger.I mean, at least you can say that Ted has won something, and you know, Marco has not won.That’s it.Didn't give them to the FBI?I’m not talking progressive like a Bernie Sanders would say, the guy want to tax you.I was just given.I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WALL.Incredible family.Come here, Steve.Our first responders have been doing absolutely heroic work to shepherd people out of harmâ€™s way, and their courage and devotion has saved countless lives.Our military — they pay us peanuts, like nothing.That was great and it’s a great achievement.THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™m talking to him.You look at San Bernardino.My friend for a long time, and just somebody that he liked me from the beginning and I liked him, Billy Long.No, you’re going to like me and we’re going to be back and we’re going to do a great job for you.It’s called leadership.So I’m going to look into that.But do you think that Ben is going to go to China?When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One.And Reince and my whole group.It was just like a little fundraiser.WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK.You see it all over.Yeah.AND WE'RE GOING TO.I refuse to be politically correct.Thatâ€™s three.Can I say that?It’s a hoax, a lot of it.The United States was not respected.But we’re going to spend a lot of time in Florida.We can't let this happen.Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there.So they went to the judge and they said "Your honor, we’d like to have her not be a participant, not be a plaintiff in the case."They didn’t even know what it was for.They want to see things properly taken care of.Q    Sir, I just didnâ€™t understand what you were saying.There is so much money to be saved.I’ve won like most of the states."The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time.We picked the worst photo taken of me.He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana.(Laughter)


And yet, I see a poll at 42 percent.I don’t know.It will not be allowed to go forward.Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you’re running, it doesn’t matter.Bridges are collapsing all over the country.Do you definitively say that nobody â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I had nothing to do with it.You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.On a Saturday morning yet.We have to make that – but I do like him.Now, look, fair trade â€” not free â€” fair.And not all of them but most of them are just interested in "Where’s my check?And this is a wall too.THEY'RE OVER.After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership now proven to be totally incompetent and corrupt, you have found NOTHING!And we are leading in every poll, remember that please.You know, my whole life, I was told thatâ€™s the toughest deal.So here’s the story.How many people have heard "The Snake"?So I want to do away with executive orders for the most part.(Laughter.)So I made this deal and it was great.At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.THE PRESIDENT:  Have they been what?It should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a “leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership”.Speeches, speeches, in front of 25,000, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop.They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?It’s like stamped into their forehead – "I take care of Cruz."I’ve been on the cover a lot.Now, if that can’t happen.So she’s fighting for her life.Q    So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.(Applause.)THEY WOULD HAVE GONE NUTS.There is a possibility that I will extend the date.So we have to do something.Club for Growth.Join me in building this reality.IT JUST CAME OUT.I said, "I know it’s crude.And our great members of Commerce [Congress], I want to thank you all for coming.Very hard.So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time.My administration is working every day to deliver the world-class infrastructure that our people deserve and, frankly, that our country deserves.So I hear that they’re talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the Second Amendment and a judge that – and this is one of many.YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY.Total annihilation.They’re going to say, "No, we’re not giving."(Applause.)The other day, they did a great report of me.(Applause.)Thank you.But so did many other leaders â€” almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.You know, so many decisions.I disagree with that.With me, that’s easy.I don’t know that to be true.My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.And what she did — (CHEERS) — let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.OUR POLICE ARE THE BEST OF OUR SOCIETY.And then he double-downed…
You know what?I like them.Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.That’s exactly what’s happening.We will run it.Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration â€” and you know what Iâ€™m talking about, right?Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.I took a deep breath and I went down and I talked about lots of things, including illegal immigration.And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.But it came out the other day, I think it said "$68 million, 55,000 negative ads."Everything that has come since â€” our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice â€” all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.The whole thing is crazy.It was a total disaster for our country.I mean, why are they even saying it?And I just think youâ€™d be a lot better off â€” I honestly do.It’s very hard to get.Now, number one, he shouldn’t be saying that because you’re telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that.All you want is a government that shows you the same loyalty in return.But again, you can’t go in with that – if you’re going to make a deal and you could make a great deal – you can’t go in with the attitude we’re going to shove it down.America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.Weâ€™ll be meeting in Hanoi.THE PRESIDENT: All right.But this this has been an amazing period of time.Thank you.And the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak.So that will change.We are going to get that brought back and I think it’s going to be very hard to counter it.They wanted Boeing’s secrets.But weâ€™re going to get it by.I use many stats.And I donâ€™t want anything to get in our way.We’re up by so much.So, here’s the deal.In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen.Because I have to do what’s right.I just have to turn off the television so many times.Here we are in Syria.They have so many new words.But I say oh if I put a tax on these characters – these idiots.Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border.Ford, moving into Mexico.Took a little radio ad in Iowa.Get rid of the exclamation point and just put Jeb Bush.I gotta build those big buildings.Not all of them but most of them.Weâ€™re going to build up your schools.So with the UK, weâ€™re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.Like, little.It will be easy.And sheâ€™s very committed to that.And our jobs market, we’re going to have it rocket again, we’re going to make great trade deals.But we will get the job done.We have to be smart.It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things.But I was on the other side.(Applause.)Q Just a brief follow-up.Thank you very much everybody.Because we’re getting rid of ISIS.Go ahead.It’s true.Number one, the people negotiating don’t have a clue.I don’t care.They said he talks about illegal immigration, we’re not going to put him on television.Trillion.No PPP [sic].And he wasnâ€™t told, â€œOh, go up and say it.â€  I know where theyâ€™re coming from.That’s what I was – I’m a businessperson.You look at some of the things that she’s saying right now.And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take.One of them is immigration.And then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I will probably be able to get it straightened out, I understand this now.You know, when I was young and when I was â€” of course, I feel young.A mountain moved over an inch and a half.We need a new leader fast.And they said, â€œThe New York Times made it up.I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other.It was a big evening.Now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything…But what are they doing with this whole thing?Because if they are, I want to shake your hand.I’ll try – I don’t know maybe there’s some rules against it.Iâ€™ll be reaching out.And we have a president – we shouldn’t have been there but then we shouldn’t have left the way we left.They said, "Hey, what do we have to get killed for?"Thatâ€™s what, probably, the number-one ingredient of toughness is.I’m really good at that stuff.Weâ€™re going to make them safe.But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.And you’re going to be very happy with it.That I can tell you.And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to â€” you know, they did a great job.So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iranâ€™s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.And that seems to be resonating very strongly.Did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?"Yes, but sheâ€™s doing poorly, very poorly.And where are we now?They love the owners; they think the owners are great.Do you really believe that stat?They make $1 billion a day.I guess.He left.Wait, wait, wait.It was from me.So they’re leaving and they’re taking their jobs with them.Wait.I wanted that piece of property so badly.And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so â€” they were â€” when I heard some of those things, I said â€” I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.We don’t need anything.Anybody know where that is?They’re afraid.It will be vetoed 100 percent.Thatâ€™s always a possibility.Nobody is going to mess with us.Now, maybe it had to do – who knows why?I was in favor of it even before...There are two Chicagos, as you know.(Applause.)America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in theMiddle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.That was it.Just one minute.Iâ€™m going to have to get other judges and other Supreme Court judges, possibly.The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do.I just donâ€™t have the time to speak to her.Come on, letâ€™s go.And hopefully we can renegotiate it.Theyâ€™ve treated our farmers in Wisconsin, and New York state, and a lot of other states very badly.In fact, Mark Burnett called up.But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year — actually more than a year — we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially.Then I do The Apprentice.He didn’t give an answer as to exactly what he’s going to do.Now, that was staged by the Democrats.IT'S RIGGED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.I don’t have to worry about Obamacare.Much, much higher – double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates.You are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions.Thank you, Senator.And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.But we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be.I love the people of Mexico.My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.Fight.What he just said, I never thought of it."It has been an honor to be here, I love this area, I love the people here.But you have to use the laws to your advantage.General Kelly has done a great job â€” General Kelly.I never see my Barron and it’s his birthday on Sunday so we’re very happy about that.Well, I think I have – I think it fits me better, probably suits me better.But a lasting deal, a real deal.You have people â€” and Iâ€™ve seen this, and Iâ€™ve sort of witnessed it.I love you.And everybody is in love with it.But they’re not allowed to do their jobs.Okay?So when Iâ€™m interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and, in this case, went so quickly â€” because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia.So you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you?And Darrell â€” I met Darrell when he was defending me on television.He’s very upset.We have people and I’ll tell you something.So did I go to Ivy League college.And for years â€” because it was never changed â€” NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.Thatâ€™s all I can say.It’s a noisy majority.25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%.Itâ€™s crazy.We’re going to figure it out.They were in there for like $20 million.And when we unify, there’s nobody, nobody that’s going to beat us.You’d think that if somebody’s good for the country – and I’ll be great for the country because I’m going to make great deals for our country.I can’t tell you yet.And I like President Xi a lot.You know?And weâ€™re defending you, and weâ€™re subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money.â€

I said it to South Korea."From negative to positive."Every time they get a report, it's millions.People are very unhappy about it.Thank you very much.Our president doesn’t have a clue.Thank you.We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.Itâ€™s crazy.I was amazed.This has been very exciting, this whole process.Theyâ€™re not everybody thatâ€™s like you.And, by the way, weâ€™re going to be taking care of ICE.At some point, Iâ€™ll, you know, give these letters â€” theyâ€™re incredible letters.Is that okay?For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton’s war in Libya....
Q&A






22 veterans a day commit suicide.Itâ€™s been great for Canada.We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.We’re not going to have a country.Why is the taking a call from a Russian?He said he never said it.So a reporter for Time magazine â€” and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times.But Iâ€™ve had a lot of false charges made against me â€” really false charges.That’s enough.The relationship is very good.One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.You were getting ready to give a big Applause, because you like that, and I’m speaking.Now we leave because of a lack of leadership.Great state, great people.TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they’re not going to Tennessee.And this, the United States of America, is your country.You would have lost millions of people.But we are going to try very hard.I do care so much about it.There’s total hatred and there’s total gridlock.That had so much — look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump.He’s been a very bad judge.(Applause.)I’ve given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response.And weâ€™ve just started on that one.Weâ€™re not prosperous anymore....I was a member of the establishment six months ago.But weâ€™ll do it with great deals.Only one.And China is not open, but weâ€™re open to them.We have no choice.I build infrastructure.Can you imagine what they’ll do in large groups, which we’re allowing now to come here.THE PRESIDENT:  Howard graduate.All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls.THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™ve known them.Any member of Congress who votes in support of impeachmentâ€”against every shred of truth, fact, evidence, and legal principleâ€”is showing how deeply they revile the voters and how truly they detest Americaâ€™s Constitutional order.That’s why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren’t working.You know, we’re going away and he goes, "When are you going to be come home, daddy?They have to work with us.Somebody is making a fortune.And you are bringing up a point that I’ve heard before.Trust me, they’re great negotiators.Macy’s, NBC, Serta and NASCAR have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country.Look, I’m a negotiator like you folks.So you have a disadvantage.President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure.And if we donâ€™t have a strong military â€” that hopefully we wonâ€™t have to use because itâ€™s strong â€” if we donâ€™t have a strong military, you donâ€™t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems.And it will lower the business tax rate from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive anywhere in the world.So that’s something to me that’s very exciting.(Applause.)More than 3,000.Big advantage.Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?In almost 20 years.Itâ€™s all made in the United States.You know, I asked how many people would be here tonight.Very unfortunate.Iâ€™m Lisa from the PBS â€”

THE PRESIDENT: See, it just shows you about the press, but thatâ€™s the way the press is.You’ve got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it.They all got the money.And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it.Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases.They have great principals.Itâ€™s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.They want to do their job; they’re not allowed to."Dear So and So, I’m sorry I don’t really want your money."So many good things.38 to 12.Should I do it or not?When the parents take over and I really mean this because I’ve seen it.With hundreds and hundreds of security and you’re closing down Burbank, California.We have to be smart.This guy’s a very big one.We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam.They just didn’t want to go through the unfair questions because they weren’t questions; they were statements.Weâ€™re going to get infrastructure built quickly, inexpensively â€” relatively speaking â€” and the permitting process will go very, very quickly.But...And again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying.Because the spirit.You know, when I won New Hampshire, those people were so incredible to me.And they buy apartments from me; they work for me by the thousands – by the thousands.And it was covered that way.THE PRESIDENT: Well, the leaks are real.And he said, "You’re going to win.Iâ€™m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that weâ€™re waiting for.Somebody said, are you young?And maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we wonâ€™t have columns.Take a look at that.A lot of the past administrations, they had â€” it was easy to get, and they didnâ€™t build or they didnâ€™t do what they could have done.Am I so bad?"Their thing is getting re-elected.I donâ€™t want them to have nuclear weapons.I see them on television – generals.So you know, look, you can’t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, he’s done executive order, executive order.And then you have all these other guys spending vast — and they like the way the United States is run.But, they build this wall.It’s anchor baby.And I called my people and I said, "How can we win?Bush, 426 when he won as President.Walker, nice guy, he went down.You know Obama, as you know he said it won’t happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started.It's going to be repealed and it's going to be replaced.But this is what we have.THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.You people know.Of course, he says he’ll be elected.So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.I said, "Absolutely, 100%."In the other case youâ€™re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.Yes, please.We’re going to take care of our Second Amendment.They’re great.Q    â€” had meddled in or are meddling in â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s right.Number one per pupil in the world.They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money.It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear.Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.I did another one – I did a bigger version of that recently Ferry Point out in the Bronx.I have the best – I have one of the great people – Sen. Jeff Sessions, who’s great.It can take forever.You look at the TSA, you look at what’s going on at the airports and you look at that.And some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage.Sit down.We have to build that up a little bit more.Okay?"I have 7 delegates right at the top.So it’s true, we’ve had tremendous response.I love all these people.Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.Thank you.The wall just got 10 feet higher."THE PRESIDENT:  Thereâ€™s nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court.I’m going here – we’re going to stay tomorrow.Just remember this: I’m going to be your champion.I’m going to tell you — thank you.Fire and fury.I went to an Ivy League school, I’m very highly educated.To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.You know, if you want to become a citizen of Mexico…do you know it’s one of the hardest countries in the world to become a citizen of?The 14th Amendment does not give them clearance on that.I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn’t been able to – Marco doesn’t show up to the United States Senate.We have deficits that are enormous.It’s called using the laws.Only a foolish person would say 99%.Thank you all very much.Youâ€™re going to be happy, I tell you.These women said great things.â€œTo me,â€ Joshua recalls, â€œthe American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.â€  They came down from Heaven.That one little thing.And everybody took it fine.He goes around saying "Trump is my all-time hero."We will start winning again.And I said, â€œGee, thatâ€™s too bad.â€  I knew them a long time ago â€” 15 years ago, 20 years ago.I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.So weâ€™re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.We’re going to make America great again.(Applause.)If I think we need them, Iâ€™ll start them before the generals will start them.It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best.But weâ€™re stepping up now.OKAY.Where is Ms. Delgado?"Oh, he’s not going to win New Hampshire."But when you look at what’s happening with corporations and the highest tax – we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country – but they have trillions of dollars overseas.In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you’ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they’ve got to go out, and they’ve got to start this educational process.You know Carl — great businessman.Usually I do.She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia.Q    Can I â€” can I just ask â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  â€œYou donâ€™t mind paying billions of dollars a month in tariffs.â€

Q    I just had two small follow-ups.Why is Obama a unifier?THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.Q    â€” are we going to be seeing anything concrete â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  A lot has been accomplished.It’s going to be replaced.Reuters.And maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they’ll have 75% and maybe they’ll like them better.He didn't know what he was doing.And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, â€œPlease, please.â€  And I thought â€” I said, â€œNo, it canâ€™t happen.So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it’ll be well-over $10 billion.Now, let me just tell you something.Come on.Our party must dream as big and as bold as Lincoln and Eisenhower.But nobody cares.Right?This was a very sad circumstance that happened with – I mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance.This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.You got to stop him.You’re going to have great health insurance.Maybe not.That’s the way we do it.We know Israel is willing to deal.Just today I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor, brave people.THE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, â€œOh, Judge Kavanaughâ€¦â€ this or that.You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long?Just relax.That had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible.And these young people – and I tell the press you’ve got to stop calling them "masterminds" – these are dirty, rotten scums.It’s going to be repealed.So what happens – thank you.Obamacare is gone.I don’t want your money.Three hundred percent.And I do write about it.I mean, you’ve got to see that truck right there?I donâ€™t want to hear â€” and Iâ€™ll turn it into good.By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily.The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.Q    Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)?This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class.I want them to invest in it.Thank you, maâ€™am.We discussed everything: Ukraine, Syria, Israel and Israelâ€™s protection.We have an amazing group.He loves Common Core, meaning he wants your kids educated from Washington, which is immediately no good.And it’s very, very sad.I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company.When she ran for the United States Senate in New York, we have upstate New York which is a total disaster, economic disaster.Great business man.Theyâ€™ll say things; they donâ€™t mean it.And I said, â€œWhatâ€™s the biggest problem?â€  He said, â€œBy far, North Korea.â€  And I donâ€™t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea.WHAT DO YOU MEAN, POP?She's going to pay it at the polls.All right.You know, who wants to use our military?These are great people.Go ahead.Plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along.You know, they’re very much into the trade world and I’m the best on trade.We’ve started working already on the convention.I mean, these people.You know, all this.The Virginia one was just a great win because it’s a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in Florida.THE PRESIDENT: Not good.But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don’t extensions or anything.And I asked them.And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.(Applause.)But I thought his was a softer interview.And, really, under the kind of stress that sheâ€™s under and the heartache that sheâ€™s under, I thought putting out that statement, to me, was really something.But you know what?We’re going to win for our vets because our vets have been treated too badly.AND EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED.They’re made up of illegal immigrants.We have come up.By the way, great ship named after Iowa too.The numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that’s a shame


…Tell you what, as President, I can guarantee it.We have a news conference.Q    And my final question, sir,

THE PRESIDENT: One more question.That's where Trump was going to — they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places.We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.Right?Theyâ€™re building things that we donâ€™t build anymore.And even for the politicians they run at least they’re out on the line, and then you see the dishonesty.I’ll tell you what, we will have that money back – if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin.And weâ€™re doing well.I think we’re going to do fantastically well in Iowa.You’re going to say, "Oh, get him the hell out of here."I know who you are.We will ensure that the America warrior â€” and if you think about it, the great American warriors â€” because thatâ€™s what they are â€” are given the tools, the funding, the resources, the training and equipment they so richly deserve.Well, you’re going to look – a lot of controversy with Mr. Singer.I WANT TO SO BADLY.Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.Let’s do Ivanka.I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window.BECAUSE IF I DON'T WIN THE NEXT ONE, I WILL CONSIDER IT A BIG, FAT WASTE OF TIME AND $55 MILLION I PUT UP, AND I'M STILL PUTTING UP A LOT MORE.We had a certain – same event – it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people.We’re going to take care of that.I saw him on one show.But the deal is done.Because you know what?You donâ€™t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and thatâ€™s it.This is the way we fight today.Boy, do you look good though.That’s what they are.And the reason youâ€™re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media.President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win.So, Iran now wants to negotiate separately for the (inaudible).In fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee.They don’t have loyalty to the United States.This is going to be an important moment for all of us.I think itâ€™s great.Was this terrorism?And they all stood up and said "No, no, don’t take it."OUR COUNTRY IS FLAT BROKE.That I can tell you.We’re not going to let our jobs go.That I can tell you.THEY SAY THE NASTIEST IN RECORDED HISTORY.Some of you saw that.And it wasnâ€™t pleasant to watch, especially for me.Okay?THINK OF IT.We’re never going to have to use it.We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country.Well, he’s [referring to Scott Brown] somebody that I respect, always liked.You weren’t allowed to have any more people than that.Let me tell you, the veterans why they believe.Now, here’s what is going to happen.The toughest gun laws in the world, they have it in Paris.I didn’t expect it.…Boy, oh, boy.And that’s what I alluded to before.Northern Marianas Islands have been so incredible, and we picked up nine delegates this morning.(Applause.)WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.The economy is bad.But Indiana was going to be the firewall.They’re going into all of these different places.They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing.Well, they can always do that and then they’ll — then they’ll just lose everything and that would be the — that would be the work of a loser.Back to Mike Pence.I was joking.Look, he certainly can’t endorse me after what I did to him in the race.Everybody has got to be happy.The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press.These people – they don’t have any –


Now, when other people do that, when a Carl does it – I mean, they do it all the time.So, Joe, I just really appreciate it.Now they’re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world.But what I like is in Syria, with other people’s money, meaning the Gulf states and others and Germany and others.Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia.GREAT PEOPLE.Weâ€™re going to try and stop crime.So weâ€™re doing it a different way, a complex way.It’s true.America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism.And I am in favor of if they can’t get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they’re going to see a doctor and the country’s going to pay for it.I donâ€™t really know.He didn’t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere.And I think weâ€™re doing a really great job with my team.OK.What’s going to happen after that?Notice how easy it is?Yes.Nobody â€” not Tennessee.They’re retiring.‘Take me in, oh tender woman.I’ve won just about I think almost every place I’ve won with evangelicals.AND IN SYRIA, WE'LL BUILD SAFE ZONES, AND WE'LL GET OTHER PEOPLE TO PUT UP THE MONEY, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO OWE VERY SOON 20 TRILLION, TRILLION WITH A T. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS.How about we do it right now?I don’t talk to him.We will do everything we can to lower business burdens and to make it easier for our businesses to thrive and compete.You take a look.We’re going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs.So, I come up and I’m hearing that Obama now who said by the way yesterday, "Donald Trump will not be the president.You’re going to see some real good things happen.This is about 100 degrees right now.So, Bush does an ad."Oh no, we’re not doing nuclear weapons."You know, everybody says "Oh, you won’t be a unifier".We've never had this before.But I was hoping I could ask a question.Go ahead.When I got there, I said, â€œHow is this possible?â€  I have 145 â€” including court of appeals â€” judges.(Applause.)And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."If we achieve sustained three percent growth, that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion dollars of new economic activity over the next decade.It’s theft.LOSING THOUSANDS OF LIVES, SPENDING TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.I don’t care too much about the debates.All right, next question.Why wouldn’t he make it?"Theyâ€™re coming back, too, believe me.Iâ€™ve seen a highway recently in a certain state â€” I wonâ€™t mention its name â€” 17 years.He’s smart.What Jeb Bush was saying at the last debate?When I was young, we were always winning things in this country.Ford moving to Mexico.Thank you, A.J.That’s so nice.Every once in a while you luck.We’re going to build a wall.Dairy products â€” 300 percent.An incredible family.You see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to--.The only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we can't get them in.We have people that have no incentive to work.They stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them.You know about Sergeant Bergdahl.Those are the few.Iâ€™ve been involved with this stuff all my life.The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because weâ€™re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.I would have never done it.They were fed up.The guy looks â€” guy looks like heâ€™s shocked.The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial wellbeing of all America.THAT NEGOTIATION TOOK FOREVER AND WE DIDN'T WIN A POINT.The public gets it, you know.Or we disagree on something else."And they say, "What do you think?And I was able to see that, Klaus, as a businessperson.So nice.I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing.I’m actually a nice person.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, youâ€™re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?Go ahead.I’d like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey and California.Politically, I may be right.Heâ€™s all by himself â€” seven people and Paris.Itâ€™s not a bad term at all.He said, "I can’t get it into China.Weâ€™re going to be taking care of ICE.We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we will be protected by God.It has gotten totally out of control.And frankly, I think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives, OK.WE HAD SO MANY COACHES.That’s all right with me."He’s only worth $5 billion."So, we’re going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that’s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly.But if I’m forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.You’ve got to teach them how to behave, right?I go crazy.You don’t have to know the details....I love you too.That torch is now in our hands.I really don’t know.AND YOU KNOW WHAT?PARTICIPANT:  This is real.Itâ€™s been great for Mexico.The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big.I mean, there’s just a big bonding process going on.And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldnâ€™t be there.The dumping was horrible.And everyone knows that if sheâ€™s elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and suffering and crime and heartache.He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me.I don't mean by a little.I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.It’s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves.I’m self-funding."Itâ€™s been a lot of fun, too.And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit.We see it.(Cross-talk.)And you’re going to look around and you’re going to remember who the people are that are here because we’re doing something special.70,000 jobs.(Applause.)In fact, I’m like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit.It’s a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again.And I have millions of votes more.They’ll be revoked.Bob Dole is a fan of mine.Today, we have generals that go on talk shows...I saw a general the other day on a talk show.When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let’s say, China in a trade deal?It’s a very special place to me for a very special reason.And theyâ€™re doing it, theyâ€™re starting.Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute.And, you know, when she said that, I had no choice, because I didn’t start it.Same amount but just in little sections.I know the overrated ones.He was very nice.Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.They said "We want everybody to pay at least something."Nobody believes that.The military was depleted.TRUMP: I will tell you who the better friend is and some day I believe that will be proven out bigly (ph).The Republicans agree it should be brought back in.They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."I get my numbers from a lot of sources â€” like Homeland Security, primarily.Kasich, I don’t think he’s a player here.Steve, what the hell happened?I â€” you didnâ€™t let me ask my question.Representative Vicky Hartzler, who has been terrific.We have Caterpillar tractors — I want to use Caterpillar; I don’t want to use Komatsu.Now, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they’ve apologized to me.Then I looked at Rubio.And weâ€™re going to do it one way or the other â€” we have to do it â€” not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.AND MUCH OF THAT MONEY CAME IN SMALL DONATIONS LIKE $71 AVERAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.We don’t even know.They didnâ€™t want to go that far.What do they call that thing?But I’ll tell you when it comes to that stuff I’m really – there’s nobody better.I don’t know what they do.PPP 28% for Trump, 26% for Cruz.So nice.Thereâ€™s no collusion.(Laughter.)You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.If a corporation gives out a bigger dividend, that’s great.I don’t even care at this point.IT WAS -- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.I think we’re going to be more unified and I think we’re going to be a much bigger party, and I think we’re going to win in November.Donâ€™t you understand â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, I only say this: thirty-six years â€” no charge, no nothing.Everybody knows this story.But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back.Don't forget another thing.But it is – by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there’s nothing like it.Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.We need tough.Thank you.I mean, he’s somebody that I can certainly see that because I like him, he likes me.We got to stop those drugs.But we paid $150 billion.I get along great with China.And he was very successful.Rush Limbaugh said "The most incredible incoming that I’ve ever seen a human being endure".And if you look at number, the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation is a fabulous group and I didn’t have to go through a big vetting process with them.You know, New Hampshire was so amazing.So I’ll just tell you that I’m going to win.We’ll do another one.Now, they’re there — the cameras are on live right now.WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THERE THAT GOT IN FOR POLITICS.We're incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us.In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition?It really is.Weâ€™re not going to be the people that are taken advantage of any longer.The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president, 100 percent.I don’t think so, but we — they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually.You’re not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists.A person came up and said, "Oh, that’s not nice."Q    Itâ€™s going to be good, sir.House Democrats are trying to impeach the duly elected President of the United States for asserting Constitutionally based privileges that have been asserted on a bipartisan basis by administrations of both political parties throughout our Nationâ€™s history.But he was dealing â€” as he should have been â€”

Q During the election?I love winning with women.Stand up.Thank you.That was so incredible.THE PRESIDENT: I have â€” you know what, he said no.Bomb.We are going to help the country, that’s called helping the daughter.When I came in, and certainly before I came in â€” and even at the beginning of mine because when I was having rhetorical contests â€” you know, contests, really, I guess you could call it â€” with Chairman Kim, which we both smile at now and we laugh at.As an example, why didnâ€™t they take care of Yemen in the deal?(Applause.)I made a speech.Nobody had guns on the other side.It’s bad for – all of this illegal immigration.THANK YOU.It’s crazy.Because if I win Iowa, I think we’d run the table.You know, the funny thing about The Apprentice – there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice.And finally, somebody said, "Well, we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status."I mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building.I mean, she goes along with everything.We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.Q    Mr. President, there are now three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.They’re going to get Yemen.I would say far more productive than you would understand.And somebody could say things.And then after Paris – and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world.And allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant.When they’re on the stand and you say "How come you signed the letter saying that Trump University was so good?NOT EVEN CLOSE.Instead of 2 for 1, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every 1 new rule.I HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESSMEN IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE ENDORSED ME, INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE CARL ICAHN, GREAT BUSINESSMAN.And, what did they do?But I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times.We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.No, but the tone is such â€” I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.We’re ending Common Core – I told you that – and we’re moving it locally.While my opponent slanders you as deplorable â€” and irredeemable!We have people that – they don’t talk.So easy.I would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn’t go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me.But I was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate.Q Thank you, Mr. President.Iâ€™m not finished.This is going to change so fast.Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.You cut it in half, we’ve actually have a few more women.Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe.SO HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS.Thank you.I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria.Okay?And we’re going to change it.That was a horrible day â€”

Q    Sir, youâ€™re not putting these protestors on the same level as neo-Nazis â€”

Q    Is the alt-left as bad as white supremacy?This is not some natural disaster.We used to think "Oh, that was easy."I want to take our wealth back from China, from Mexico, from all of these countries that have our wealth.No matter where we go we fill up the arenas.I like to get things done first.And they said it was a total lie.And if I donâ€™t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country.I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that’s terrible.See, now itâ€™s different.I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.Oh, and somebody said Sharon.And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country.But to create this future, we must work with, not against â€” not against â€” the men and women of law enforcement.And weâ€™re unable to compete with other nations.I mean, we’ve got to get something.And the reason we’re on the cover a lot is because we have a movement the likes of which people have never seen.No nuclear testing.I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.The freeing of political prisoners.So we have a lot of lawyers here.Our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports.51% – 51% highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia.It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious, it's beautiful.Horrible.We will make our country strong again.Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places.All of the September 11th hijackists were issued visas.So, China has 18,000 or 13,000 miles, and we have 1,000 miles.(Applause.)And would you believe I’m not going to do anything?Right, the famous escalators.And he actually hasn’t come very close.You’re going to win.I think the liberal media and I’ve been dealing with you a long time.Not going to be playing games.Q    How concerned are you about race relations in America?You know, you look at the beautiful trees or the woods or the roadways and the lakes.But theyâ€™re great people.It was like D-Day when we put those papers in.You know, we’re doing well."That ceiling is nothing compared to the wall.Gravis just came out – 34% for Trump, 28% for Cruz.Some friends of mine, some more coming in.But weâ€™re going to end it.WELL, WE'RE GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT IT.OK, one or two more questions.One thing on education.Office of Management and Budget.Serious size.But he said the other day that after this rip-off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the United States again.Allowing people in from areas of the world we don’t know where they come from.So, we’re going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries.No purpose.OK, yeah?Very important, right?And they know it.So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.No, my supporters are really supporting me because I’m very competent, because they know that I’m not going to let China rip us off.I like China.Why can’t we be unpredictable?…I have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women.So, the question is statute of limitations.And it’s unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money.That’s what we’re going to do.And we thought they maybe but we didn’t want to racially profile.Practically everything that she was complaining about — she’s picked up what I say.Before we begin, Iâ€™d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.(Applause.)Another great Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, had a vision of a national infrastructure plan.They have to end it, and now!I said, "What have I done?"But I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn’t raise any money for them.Why aren’t they flying at least the same plane?Their criminal list â€” a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.I said, thatâ€™s terrible that it was leaked but it wasnâ€™t that important.Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.When people ask why, it’s because that’s not how you make a deal.And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.What’s giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that I’ve met – the incredible people of this country.You take a look at Germany, you take a look at Sweden, you take a look at Brussels.(Laughter.)All talk, no action, believe me.Why did they do it?I could tell you, I’m not going to mention anybody specifically, but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting.Iâ€™m sorry.Like you know the expression – it draws flies?I think if somebody is doing as well as I’m doing — and I’m not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else — but if I’m going to win five — I’ve already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine.But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad Iran’s behavior is.Iâ€™ve been talking about that for a long time, but itâ€™s very, very important to me.So they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind.Iâ€™m a very famous person, unfortunately.But I’m very happy for Tom.You’ll see that in 60 Minutes last night.Very different.That’s not going to happen with me.PAGE, PAGE.This is a room loves and cherishes the second amendment.So I only tell you this:  There are two sides to a story.It's going to terminated.And, by the way, before I start, Ivanka Trump â€” I see my beautiful daughter is in the audience.Thank you, Governor.The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and many other nations.They’re going to go to a private hospital.It’s actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that’s the end of that.A lot of people didn’t care about my view in 2003 and 2004.So if for some reason he should get the nomination, I really believe you’re wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because you’re going to have somebody that’s going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit.We’ll pick our skits.And there are some that probably â€” I agree.I can tell you there are some that I â€” Iâ€™ve been watching for a long time.Weâ€™ve begun a dramatic effort to eliminate job-killing federal regulations like nobody has ever seen before â€” slash, slash.BUT I SIGNED THE PLEDGE, TOO.But he’s not going anywhere anyway, but we’ll see what happens.Itâ€™s a criminal act.Not good.Ford’s leaving.As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SMART PEOPLE NOW.Because I’ll tell you what, it takes courage to say I’m going to run for president.But when I started this journey and that’s what it is, it’s a journey and it’s a movement that’s taking place.I love you folks very much.THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s what I like.Let people know.It’s going to end and they’re going to like us.America’s Vetdogs – The Veterans’ K-9 Corps Inc. – $75,000.Good place.I could have asked every one of the group unlike Hillary who asks people to stand outside and say "Donald Trump didn’t give the money."They said, "Why don’t you skip Iowa?"The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the worldâ€™s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  Itâ€™s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.Canâ€™t get a job.The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don’t even really know what’s happening to Israel, to anything in the area.Are they as bad as Nazis?Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything.They've been taken away, like we're babies.The Iran deal.And that’s why – why do you think she’s going along with these insane policies of his?This came out of nowhere.(Applause.)They’re sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die.So we go to Japan.Many.Right now we have investigations going on all over â€” hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons.So I will give the names because that’s what you want.And the woman – one woman was there for 40 years.We have a much bigger problem.What do you pick up?"Oh, come on back.The waits now for the VA are longer than they’ve ever been…The waits now are worse than they’ve ever been.I donâ€™t have any deals in Russia.Our country doesn’t work.So we’re going to take care of our veterans.But I believe and I may be wrong – in fact, I’ll say I’m sure I’m wrong but it’s my opinion that they don’t do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people.We’re going to be smart.It’s true."Go ahead.And we’re going to take care of our vets, we’re going to take care of our vets —






 And it will cost you much less money, and it will be great.If I was losing or doing poorly, it’ll still be up.And then they found out, no, this was nuclear testing.Some have been very fair actually, and some have been not so fair.They never gave us a retraction.I don’t need that.Even worse than offending the Founding Fathers, you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying â€œI pray for the President,â€ when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense.And thereâ€™s a tremendous spirit.And we’re going to use — we have the best.And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.As far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and it’s a little bit sad.The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara â€” and I think itâ€™s very important â€” the illegal giving out classified information.But with Carrier...they’re coming across and they’re going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from Mexico – probably – we’ve probably given them subsidies.BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BREAK OUR PIGGY BANK VERY SOON.Every time I see him.It’s a huge problem.Listen to this.Weâ€™re doing very well.A disgrace.Because Iâ€™ve had a lot of false charges made against me.So my executive order also requires agencies to work together efficiently by requiring one lead agency for each major infrastructure project.And they set it back 35 years.I fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune.(Applause.)Weâ€™re going to make it safe.No, no, they’re so dishonest.U.S. Armed Forces are stronger than ever before.Believe me.You have Hillary against a socialist/communist."During the election, he left the race."It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.Thank you.It’s been a great honor.There’s no question about that.And thank you for being here.With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say.I spent far less than anybody else.So Iâ€™m dealing with Mexico.But Roy Moore was a Republican candidate â€”

Q    But you stood by him.Right?I’m going to go over that because I go over (ph) polls.I have been winning all of the evangelical vote.WE SEND THEM WHEAT....I know, what you’ve said I’ve heard a hundred times and daycare is a huge problem.They left to try to bring them back.I mean, I think.When people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford.And youâ€™re already seeing the results.In June, I commuted Aliceâ€™s sentence.It’s really been — it’s really been great.Now we’re going to get greedy for the United States.But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected.But because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before.I said, "Wow, this shouldn’t be that good of a game."But we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out.So we’ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters.And if I do that, if I see that weâ€™re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that weâ€™re charging now.Mike was doing his job.BECAUSE WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A LOT -- LOOK AT THAT.I said "Is it going to be like this for the next year and a half?"But they knew that America had to prevail.We have four people.If you go back to â€”

Q    So you had to (inaudible) white supremacists?It was a filthy lie.We don’t know what we’re doing.Thatâ€™s so beautiful.But itâ€™s going very well.I have these guys calling me up – the best in the world.Ivanka.Good luck.In this case, youâ€™re guilty until proven innocent.But they were there to protest â€” excuse me, if you take a look, the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.They have been great.Many trillions.The New York Times to me is a big deal.And I’ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.A lot.I mean, it seems like a two-person race right now...and it’s an important race to me.Q    Right.That’s what I do well.People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit.You see, I was always the fair hair boy.Real honor.But we sent them a little notice – don’t use that term.There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here.Wisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to Mexico since NAFTA.THEY WILL.Only one.I was nominated.We have to start using our head.Same thing with Australia.By delivering the House, the Senate and the White House, the American people gave us clear instructions:  Itâ€™s time to get busy, get to work, and to get the job done.We might, we might not.The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.And for those people, Iâ€™ll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared.Weâ€™ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.Who else?We’re going to do this thing together.(Applause.)Well, I guess one of the reasons Iâ€™m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing â€” thatâ€™s a ruse.They saw it.THE PRESIDENT: Itâ€™s a very fair question.I’d like to have a good name too by the way.We won with Hispanics.So I don’t like that.That’s what it draws.And he said – I think this is the word – "He’s a man of great achievement.There’s a big difference between second and third.Q    And are you okay with â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I watched everything.We have modern cranes.It was absolutely unthinkable.But think of it.Doesn’t have the right countries.And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails — but it wasn't a loss, she discarded — that in itself is a major crime.We believe in two simple rules:  Buy American and Hire American.Who?I said, I think Iâ€™m young.In fact, they said, "Donald Trump is winning," and they put some – a little slightly negative statistic in – it was like wait a minute.Doing it to help them.And it was truly an incredible group.He hated this and yet he said anybody could come.Including being 4 points up in a certain state known as Florida.They’re stupid.Q    Let me ask you, Mr. President, why did you wait so long to blast neo-Nazis?Q    Yes.This is our vision.BUT THEY GOT ACCESS.Think of it.Right?But he made the trip to be here with us tonight.And each time the pundits – these real geniuses back here – some of them are sitting back here – these real geniuses like George Will with the little glasses – take away the glasses.We’ve got plenty of time.She committed a crime.Nobody knows.He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment.So Obamacare is a disaster.I mean, we came very close to winning.We’re not going to let that happen.I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as itâ€™s true.I said, "Well, what do you think?It used to mean, oh, thatâ€™s good.Nobody respects women more than Donald Trump.I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.Nine downgrades of the state.You would have had nobody leaving.Everybody left.But they’re going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.It’s crooked stuff.That’s not the thing.Look at her face.But I’m trying to keep it as level as possible but I for the most part don’t know.This is your day.The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.We can’t let the Syrians come in that we have no idea who they are, where they’re coming from.I SIGNED IT.We have a lot of events scheduled, yes.I don’t like showing a person sleeping at the podium.And if we canâ€™t renegotiate the deal because the other side is so, so happy with it, weâ€™re going to terminate the deal and weâ€™ll start all over again, folks.But they were sitting there and they said to a woman – a wonderful woman, probably 55 years old, and her friends were there.So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal’s even better.One other thing that’s important to know.But I will tell you."On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake.Exactly what he’s going to do."And I’ll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term.We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.I do fight back.We're going to have great equipment.However, Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won’t speak honestly about what it is.But he came in third.Theyâ€™re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.Good for both countries.And I signed that.And the highest I’ve heard so far is 42%.The Chairman just left as you probably know and he’s been extremely fair.America must lead the way, not follow from behind.He raised $125 million, which means he’s controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money.Q Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.Now, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton – and I’ve said she’s the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.Iâ€™ll put them in the room and let them speak up.WE'RE THE PIGGY BANK.No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first.We’ve had some amazing results and they continue to come in.We gave it to them.(Applause.)Okay?He’s a great success."Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.It’s a barrier that can’t be broken.The city couldn’t get it built for high years.We will defend our people.Very, very few people could do the job you people do.WE HAVE A BADEN EMMY, WE HAVE AN ENEMY THAT IS DISHONEST AND A PRESS THAT IS DISHONEST.Iâ€™m surprised at them.â€

And then all of a sudden I see them on television â€” nothing to do with me.And we need the rich in order to make the great, I’m sorry to tell you.I have nothing against China.Okay?So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don’t have, Iran has.And the public is smart.They canâ€™t be â€” you know, go in and theyâ€™ve got to do what theyâ€™ve got to do with terrorists.(Applause.)Because â€” we all know why â€” because itâ€™s called politics.So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn’t want to do that because it’s not their thing to do.The message is what we want.I don’t want them over there.They werenâ€™t even a part, really â€” I mean, they were such a minor part â€” I hadnâ€™t spoken to them.We’re going to win a lot.My kids – they’re not kids anymore but they’re kids as far as I’m concerned.But radical Islam is – I’ll tell you one thing I know isn’t is global warming.Thank you!But I see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber.Another one had other things happen.Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.But to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll.It has been a complete and total disaster.Q    Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because itâ€™s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office.Because you know, you look at as these countries fall over there, Israel’s looking more and more – you know, Israel has some difficulties.But you know what?Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views.I mean, it’s only too bad that winner didn’t take all, because if winner took all, this thing is over.And I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here.He's very, very weak on immigration.It's not fair because it was a long t--  That doesn't work.I mean, it’s virtually all – Republicans don’t even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5%.But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.It’s terrible and it should be ended.And weâ€™ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.And now the Asians all hate him.In a certain way, maybe they’re defending me although I will tell you they’re not doing it for that reason.Itâ€™s going to go very well on Monday, or Saturday, or Sunday, or whenever they vote.Nobody’s going to tell us what to do though.It’s 99.9%.They’re disgusted with our incompetent politicians.To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support.And yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far — there is nobody close.But the big thing – I lost certain businesses and I owned the Miss Universe Pageant.I did like, five today.â€  Every time I sit, I take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room â€” meaning, reporters.You know, this isn’t 68 years ago.Q How are you interpreting those moves?He’s a great financial guy.It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true.We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.It is politician-made disaster.First time, they’ve ever done it and they gave me an endorsement.I wanted to take oil.You need Trump.But more money is coming through than didn’t come through.You know, it’s a talent.Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last week at a public forum that your partyâ€™s impeachment effort has been going on for â€œtwo and a half years,â€ long before you ever heard about a phone call with Ukraine.And I like him, heâ€™s a good man.And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.And there are many.No, I like him.I said, I didnâ€™t get booed.Now I heard the other day they won’t even do anything to him.He was so rough with Chairman Kim â€” Kim Jong Un.And I’ve seen that over the last two months.I LOVE BRIAN FRANCE.(Laughter.)By the summer of 2015, Wisconsin was facing a $2.2 billion two-year budget deficit.Well, yeah â€” enemies, sure.So many places."No!"We got some â€” all over the country, you take a look, heâ€™s done a great job.We’re going to make America great again, folks, I’m telling you folks, we’re going to make America great again.Do you mind?God bless America.The good thing is I don’t give any – why would I give any more?You look at the jobs we have....Here’s what happens.That has to be the attitude our country has.Some of his staffers were hurt really bad.I don’t know exactly what it is but it’s got to be pretty good because I see the response.But Iâ€™m involved.And weâ€™re going to be renegotiating NAFTA and our terrible trade deals.Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad."You’ve dominated the Summer of Trump."And Obama, I mean, she can’t go against him because only does boom she gets indicted.So â€” and I do â€” and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think heâ€™s a fine man.Vincente Fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have — if I ever used that word you folks would’ve never, ever, ever let me get away with it.We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty.AND FOR THAT PLEDGE, THEY GOT ACCESS TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MATERIAL FROM THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, THE RNC.We’re going to build a wall that’s going to be a real wall.What’s going to happen?"The problem here is fundamental.By the way, this is important, I sort of lucked into this one.So will you get me that number and everything and we’ll make sure that everything get – and somebody else – who else over here?You’ve treated me actually very fairly.And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay.We lose on everything.You know?It’s going to be a lot of time.I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but â€” (applause) â€” but before I can do that â€” I would have loved to have put it first, Iâ€™ll be honest â€” there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.He wouldn’t know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is they’re trying to take – we just went up in the last poll.And it's never going to stop.Cannot afford it.I think you know if you look at what’s going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls – again I don’t want your money therefore you’re probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money.(Applause.)The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.But we’re not going to allow and we’re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I’ve said it loud and clear.Q    Thank you.So we sent them a – it’s a scam, Super PACs, a scam.They have zero.I appreciate it.But you look at upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania.That was very special.Our military is going to be so amazing.We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do it


And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Not going to happen.The only thing they can do is delay.Heâ€™s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea.And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out.He was going take it, except we won it in a landslide.What do you think?Donâ€™t speak to people from Russia.I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who’ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another.We have two car companies that just announced.Itâ€™s the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disaster she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world.And this is going to be a serious wall.Q    And let me follow up on Jimâ€™s question.Weâ€™re going to take care of our miners.Q    But will you pull out of the â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™m not going to use the name â€œNAFTA.â€  I refuse to use it.And I just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions, including myself; I gave $1 million, but I just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so thankful for what we did.$1 million on a soccer field.There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.Five more minutes, is that okay?He’s one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers.(Applause.)Now, tomorrow youâ€™ll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.I’m going to tell them and I tell them.They go in for a permit â€” itâ€™s many, many years.We’re rebuilding many countries.WE WANT TO BE UPBEAT.And all of a sudden, she bolts into the picture.But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isnâ€™t fake news?But he didnâ€™t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didnâ€™t remember.Theyâ€™re not doing this for pay.I wanted to see the facts.But I’m not sure.TOOK ADVANTAGE OF EVERY SINGLE THING YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING FOR YOURSELF AND FAMILIES AND YOUR EMPLOYEES AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS, SOME OF THE LAWS ARE THE DUMBEST LAWS I'VE EVER SEEN AND SO STUPID BUT YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.But they have the most honest morning show.Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we canâ€™t â€” in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.Where are they?We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.And then if we want to buy — we want to move to another location, well, that’s very expensive if we do that.Thank you very much everybody!I think we did really well.We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.I go to various different places.So this young woman who complained, was all – she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this.I don’t know.You know what $500 billion is?In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.(Laughter.)My numbers went up.A tremendous reputation.That’s why they’re coming in, because they’re so fed up with the system — this corrupt, horrible system.'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security.So I saw this.THE PRESIDENT:  Itâ€™s in Charlottesville.Right to do whatever they want.They couldn’t get an environmental impact statement.I’ve been here a lot more.We now have a gun on every table.Got a lot of money.And they know the gangs.So bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know.I donâ€™t want to be hacked.You know, China does not obey the rules.And you have a truly great quarterback.But they’d say, "That’s it.Nobody."I had to bring it up.Welcome home.Very nice.It’s so – can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that’s happening with us?But he asked me to do a commercial.I don’t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech.These guys go check.THE PRESIDENT:  You mean the one who voted against Obamacare?Thatâ€™s not going to happen while Iâ€™m President.I said, "You’re making a mistake."So weâ€™re doing very well in our situation with China on trade.WE WOULD HAVE HAD OUR HOSTAGES BACK AND SAVED $150 BILLION.I went to the mayor of New York, I said, "Ed Koch, I’ll get it done real quick."There are consequences.He takes the ad — and I shouldn’t even talk about him.So they get these – right now have gone – they’re out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I’d hate to tell you.You know, that Libya – ISIS has all that oil from Gaddafi, all of that big oil from Gaddafi.Finally, as we imagine this new prosperity at home, let us also work to achieve real and enduring peace abroad.And he just didn’t do it.Theyâ€™re being thrown into prisons.They canâ€™t go through ports of entry.You know they come up with words.Why â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.They are ripping the hell out of that ocean.And we’re going to have a strong border.But they know we have a problem.And I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually.And if we make the right choices together, then no one will ever have to tell that child that their dreams will have to wait for another day, another year, or another decade.Taking our money.He’s down to two or three — I — but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right?Many, many more people.I came in second.With 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore.The drugs that are coming across the border are beyond belief.They’ve taken so much.1400 PEOPLE, OUT OF JOBS, VISUALLY THEIR MOVING TO MEXICO.Now what would I have done in those two cases?Child care.It’s so easy.African-American people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers.I always call them the dishonest media, but they treated me nicely.They’ve got nothing but money.In the case of Jeb Bush, you’re not supposed to deal with these Super PACs.A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC.So security, strengthen yourself up.He might be on one of my courses.BUT I'M A FREE TRADE TORE MAKE GREAT DEAL -- TRADE TORE MAKE GREAT DEALS, NOT TO MAKE HORRIBLE DEALS.That was the last minute.You should use the name Bush.Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.This is an incredible group of people.And they are, they’re declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night, which is true.They’ll pay for the wall.They are ripping us.A small gas station – $43 million – and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don’t sell that type of gas.And we can’t let this go on any longer.And I had some very generous people – Carl Icahn gave $500,000.I WOULD HAVE SAID, I GUESS WE'RE NOT BUILDING IT BECAUSE I RESPECT THESE PEOPLE, THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY.Sharia authorizes – now look, this is, I mean, it’s terrible.BUT HE'S A QUALITY PERSON.As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.They need strength.As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.We don’t know who they are.We will spend what we need to rebuild our military.They wanted to do it so badly.Terrific.Our jobs have been taken away.I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m saying Iâ€™m a politician, but I guess thatâ€™s what I am now.They’re rapists.Make it fair."But now she says all of a sudden maybe less so than you thought because she’s going very, very far over to the other side.And by the way, when Obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in in ’16, you want to see bad deficits?(Applause.)WE'RE LOSING OUR COUNTRY.They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.We want our prisoners back.But we are – we’re building a great hotel down the road.I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.He said, "No, no, no, you’ve got to be kidding."But Iran has to come back, and they have to talk.I WANT SOME PROTESTERS.THEY ARE THE MOST DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH.Under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse.Iâ€™m not ranting and raving.So, he’s got a problem with the carbon footprint.The truth is she doesn’t have the strength or the energy.Very, very important to everybody in this room, but so important to my daughter.How does that help us, folks?Just can’t happen.And there is a vetting process and I think you understand that.Some of them are worth more than a billion.Good job, Ann.No, no.You know, we could say supply side.George H.W.[Audience response inaudible]
...It’s horrible.The level of dishonesty is out of control.It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.Just get me a job.They weren’t allowed to protect people.She doesnâ€™t want guns.So I would have liked that.That’s what they’re doing, folks.Now, they didn’t want Yemen.Think of it.This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws.Thank you to our hosts, thank you to the leaders and innovators in the audience.Some people will say "That’s not really a loss."I can tell you that.But if we win like I think we’re going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, it’s not going to matter.And you say why aren’t they back fighting for their country?This is what it takes to get something approved today.And itâ€™s very necessary.I have a friend who's a great builder.We’re going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion, of our religion, of Christianity, somebody that’s an evangelical.You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one â€” your number one â€” I guess, the one that is most obvious.And I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my – it’s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it’s so important and it’s been such a great – from the day I built it it was a home run.The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America.We have many companies, I say, pouring back into the country.And then it became really sunny.Others have gotten through.He’s a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don’t think so.Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because they’re going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran.They had to change their top management.The sanctions, as you know, remain.This is real love.Because I consider them enemies.…I’ll tell you what.I’m a conservative."Trump is asking for $100."How stupid can we be?But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family.And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.You’ve got to report these people.We totally destabilized the Middle East.We’ve got great numbers."Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy.Q    Should the statues of Robert E. Lee stay up?Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first.An early attempt was made at electric light.Iran can be a great country.Thank you very much.So it’s a compliment.And the other person, people knew that heâ€™d represented various countries, but I donâ€™t think he represented Russia â€” but knew that he represented various countries.But all over the country it’s a movement all over the country.Ted Cruz wants TPP and it is going to make NAFTA look like peanuts.We have to know how to win.Each one of your members lives in fear of a socialist primary challengerâ€”this is what is driving impeachment.It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it.All needless, job-killing regulations will be immediately canceled.Thank you.Then they’d rest.I said, "Tell him the following.That means everything.I’ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime.Believe me, and it’s a bad deal.Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay?I like them a lot.So we are looking into that very seriously.Here is what she said: "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."They’ve gone down.That legislative effort begins with Thursdayâ€™s crucial vote â€” and it really is a crucial vote for the Republican Party and for the people of our country â€” to finally repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Maybe, if sheâ€™ll say something â€” but in the meantime, I have to tell you, heâ€™s one of the highest quality human beings.What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall.And we’ll have something very special.The Republicans senators have delayed this for weeks now.NOW HE'S A PRO.But they said – this is hard to believe but this is what they said – a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don’t I end up with a – they said we didn’t want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners.THE PRESIDENT:  I think thereâ€™s been no greater change â€” other than maybe China, because China â€” unfortunately, their markets have dropped â€” would you say, 30 percent in the last four months, right?We have to rebuild our country.The guy that had it is a great guy – Ernie.Believe it or not, we have already proven that thatâ€™s possible.(Laughter.)You’d think somebody – even a liberal person or a Democrat liberal and I mean, really liberal.THEY SAY IT WAS THE NASTIEST PRIMARY THAT ANYBODY HAS SEEN.And I said I can’t believe it.He was replaced long before the election.We need General George Patton.But we had a bad decision.Think of it.And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we’re all good with contracts don’t start until such and such happens.Does anybody here mind?WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.And he said but in a respectful way, he said "He won because he was so damn unpredictable.The presidentâ€™s one-sided deal for Cuba and with Cuba benefits only the Castro regime.During a debate, he was losing, and he said, "Oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means."But we’re going to do a good job and we’re going have a fantastic show.And many other states.My wife didn’t even believe me, but now she does.So, we backed people that turned out to be far worse than Gadhafi.You know why the surge worked?Big tax.We’re going to win at every single element of what we’re doing.Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders.Lieutenant Governor, thank you, Lieutenant Governor.Now it’s 60,000 negative ads – most of which are absolutely false and disgusting.She was sleeping.Everybody knows that.We’ve already had some very good reviews.These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible.I think the one person, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever spoken to him.We love our country, we love our country.I don’t have time to be political.They say get rid of ISIS.…They’d be interviewed after total and complete victory.We’re going to bring in so much money and so much everything.Donâ€™t sit yet.She will not be a great president.They want whatever.Did you see that?Recently front page Wall Street Journal.And many of you know him anyway.We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury.Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of Americaâ€™s sovereignty.I would imagine.What she has done.Pretty good.It’s killing us.Q    Mr. President â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.I’ve been "get the oil, get the oil, get the oil."Again, I want to hear what she has to say.And weâ€™re going to have regulation.But we’re going to bring back our country and we’re going to have a wall and Mexico’s going to pay for the wall and you know why they’re going to pay?They’re doing it because they want campaign contributions.Number two, what I’m really doing is the big picture because corporations now are going to start having an incentive to create jobs.Look, look â€”

Q And if I may ask â€” I just want to ask one other question.And they’re creating a bubble and you know interestingly we’re so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might.So you have 22 Kill and that’s $200,000.And we’re going to say, "Bye bye.Pfizer is moving to Ireland.I mean, I want to be good.And by the way, most of that money went out very early just so you understand.We have no choice.I canâ€™t tell you.A tremendous – like 6 million people are getting Social Security.All right, I love you.THEY DON'T STOP.Theyâ€™re friends and neighbors, theyâ€™re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters â€” and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not theyâ€™ll come home safe and sound.Remember that.If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that’s a lot of money.(Applause.)Washington flourished â€“ but the people did not share in its wealth.Well, I think my book is very hard-hitting.Itâ€™s a disaster.We are going to take care of them.We’re not acting clearly, we’re not talking clearly, we’ve got problems.Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.We don’t want it.It’s very hard when somebody sends you a check for $17.50 and $9 and $200, very hard to send that back.I called, as you know, Mexico.We’re sending fighters every – Where’s Germany?And what do you â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Because heâ€™d like it.There’s nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him."Now, the good news is I sold it for a wonderful – I was very happy with that.The era of economic surrender will finally be over.What energy in this room.The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed.Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord â€” (applause) â€” thank you, thank you â€” but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.Great.Itâ€™s power.And you know, it’s hard to do this because when you think of it I’ve never done it before.You know, Wisconsin’s a really special place, and we’ve been all over today.And by the way the LGBT community is just — what’s happened to them is just so sad and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is a disgrace to that community, I will tell you right now.(Applause.)Real change.He’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders.We love it.In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray.Q    What will you do to support them, sir, (inaudible) Syria?Show how beautiful your girl was.She was a very successful model.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.I said, hereâ€™s the story â€” when you make your cars, or whatever, and you fire all our American employees, and then you think in your new plant â€” beautiful new plant, congratulations â€” youâ€™re going to sell that product our border, tax-free, youâ€™re wrong â€” 35 percent tax.You have three people.And they donâ€™t hit it.Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time.I’ve been saying that for three years.I didn’t get 30%.But that should have been with our prisoners – day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back.But itâ€™ll be American steel.But in France or in California or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in France hundreds of people in that room – Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world.So now, we’re losing Pfizer.So in France or in California, I have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in New York.John, I watched NBC.It’s been an incredible experience.Okay?I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid.We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.Q So youâ€™re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?"No, no, no, you have to – nobody doesn’t take a renewal.SPEECH 17: President Trump Statement on Immigration - Jan. 29, 2017

America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border.THEY ACTUALLY SAID IT IS A TOOL TOWARD REAL SECURITY, AN IMPORTANT TOOL.I went there.I do raise millions.Just don’t ask me why.It’s okay.But when you look at the people funding Cruz’s campaign and Kasich’s campaign, and you look – don’t forget – Cruz said, "Oh the banks, the banks."And by the way, we’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again.Iâ€™m going to rebuild our depleted â€” weâ€™re going to take care of our, the vets.And everybody admits that.You’ve got to say, "Hey, I’m a young guy.America will be a tolerant and open society.I made two speeches…I said, "You can’t get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech?"But I won with women.$70 billion a year imbalance.So we’re going to lower taxes.Last night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants.The only people that she will deliver for, frankly, are her donors and her special interests.Phil said, "Donald,"—like for the last three months he’s driving me crazy, he said—"Donald, I want to put $10 million into your campaign."That’s like the Veterans Administration.You know some people have 2%.But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldnâ€™t have ISIS because thatâ€™s where they made their money in the first place.A lot of media.You’re staying right here because it’s great.But I’m going to vote for him anyways."This is pure delay tactics.The country is booming.They're great.I just want to say get out and vote.So the total is $8,737,540,00.So I said (ph), "No, that’s the wrong number.How about that?I’m going to be really good for women.Japan’s taking our money.The all-time.But the Border Patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago.We’ll see what – you’ll have many, many people that aren’t doing very well.When one of the gentlemen said heâ€™s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, â€œWow, heâ€™s actually the cheap one in the groupâ€ â€” because theyâ€™re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars.If anyone wants to see the certified checks.You know, we’ve been hearing that number for years.I told everybody I’ll never win because I’m not Hollywood establishment.We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage.Other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly.Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.And when I say something, I mean it.Q    â€” subverting our Democratic process, and doing it to hurt you, the Republican Party â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Doing it to help them.And it’s just one of those things and we have to smarten up and we have to get really tough.So I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights.The answer is probably not.Lyin’ Ted Cruz.Thank you, Liz.The whole thing is just working out.And we’re going to change it around.And he said, â€œBecause it was too complicated.â€  Well, you just gave all your cards.If I don’t give the answer, I’m not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively.We get it.Their market is down close to 40 percent.And, by the way, my whole campaign, Iâ€™d say that.And everyone says, oh, we are doing so well.We have catch-and-release.Trump International Hotel—I keep telling Steve we have the best hotel in Las Vegas.In another words, they’re doubling down.They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I don’t want to touch them.And they’ve gone down bigly.And I know all the guys I’m running against.It really is.I’ve had so many pastors endorse me.You’re not even going to believe it.But I donâ€™t think weâ€™ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that weâ€™re going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.Thank you very much!You wouldn’t even be talking about illegal — it wasn’t even on the radar.WE'RE GOING TO BE SMART AGAIN.And many other things.is much better.It’s too late.This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceived.Over 100 years.But when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back.But they’re also leaving because we have $2.5 trillion at least – I think it’s a much higher number than that.Twitter will soon be irrelevant if lowlifes are so easily able to hack into accounts.And then he blamed it on the Asians.We don’t win with our military.It’s a very dangerous, terrible thing.Thank you.We have so, so many great people.Very bad for us.I have called this model, the model that youâ€™ve been watching, the model thatâ€™s created so much value, the model of bringing back jobs and bringing back industry â€” I called it the American Model.We vet the vets.AND ONE OF THE WORST ASPECTS OF OUR SYSTEM IS THE DISHONEST PRESS.They’ll always be my kids.But it’s not with the mouth.And the Democrats said, â€œOh, shouldâ€™ve gotten more.â€  When I made that deal, I said, â€œThis is incredible.â€  I just got â€” I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.Every country takes advantage of us, almost.It’s America first.I sort of understand thereâ€™s a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody â€” for whatever reason.46 million.But it is really ridiculous.I said, "Make America great again", and I copyrighted the term.Wait â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  You had 26 people killed â€”

Q    Let me finish the question, please.We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world.Packed.First, I said "That’s not nice.I’ve had a great relationship with jobs.You go to different places in China, different places in Asia, different places in the Middle East, you look at some of the airports they have.And I know exactly what I’m going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, "You know, here’s the problem.Our veterans...






Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly.We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.You know, when you go to a lot of these different groups, in this case, zero dollars have been taken out for administration.We’re doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party.But there is an unbelievable love in these rooms – all the same.They were ignored by Washington.Nationwide, we’re leading every poll by tremendous.Thank you very much.We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.Right?Do you agree with that?SPEECH 9: President Trumpâ€™s National Emergency Remarks - Feb. 15, 2019

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.Nobody cares.They are not taking anybody, OK?(Applause.)He got fired.â€  Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it â€œlooked bad.â€  Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually did.He said, "Donald Trump would never run."Heâ€™s the most brilliant lawyer.â€  They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago.I LOVE MY BOBBY KNIGHT.Thatâ€™s why people know that a lot of the news is fake.It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession.But so much money has been spent on me.I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind.Q Mr. President, on the travel ban â€” we could banter back and forth.This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.Highway builders must get up to 16 different approvals involving nine different federal agencies governed by 29 different statutes.I’d rather do that than sell houses.And all of a sudden â€” we got back, it was a few weeks ago.I hear the pipeline company is suing us.By the way, you know how they formed.Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare â€” (applause) â€” with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.[U.S.A. chant]

Itâ€™s time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.Said, "Donald Trump will not be – " I think we have maybe a little surprise in store, and we start right here in South Carolina.The best.But I do care.Jeb was in for like $48 million.We owe it to other countries.THEY NEED US.Itâ€™s a great question, and itâ€™s a very difficult situation, because itâ€™s been many, many years.With the American public, any deal that we strike, it’s going to look good.It’s not going to happen anymore.People â€” I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.They’re totally dishonest people.I hear he’s going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me.You’ve got to report them.I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome.It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American People.I see so many knock-offs of my hat, right?I said to him, Gary, let me ask you â€” I heard there was a lawsuit.I also want to thank the Chairman of the Republican Congressional â€” I mean, look, what a group â€” Committee.Remember Perry?HE JUST KNEW IT WAS BAD.Or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center – the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians.Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars.He wants to help the country.I put General Kelly â€” recommended by General â€œMad Dogâ€ Mattis.Q    Mr. President, Susan Li from Fox Business.Leading big in Iowa.I figured I’d be in the pack and maybe like a race horse.The people that Iâ€™m looking at are total lightweights.So the order is signed.THE PRESIDENT:  I own, actually, one of the largest wineries in the United States.And every year, they failed to deliver.And basically they don’t have the right to do that.And I’m winning by a lot and they said, "Donald Trump is winning.I don’t know what I did.Many of the great builders are in this audience tonight.And I helped Mitt Romney a lot and he lost.Q Just because of the attack â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Weâ€™ll get it.One — as sure as you’re standing there, 100 percent, Mexico’s going to pay, 100 percent.They said, "Well, we haven’t been able to look at about 400 of his companies."Nabisco’s moving there with their big plant.Thank you.So, I said, man, if I’m the enemy, I’m just going to go wait for 18 months right?We have to get our prisoners back.(Laughter.)Thank you.I said number two, to the best of my knowledge, the United States pay far too much proportionately and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people?Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life â€” all.Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel.But â€” but Iâ€™m not ranting and raving.Believe me.Paul Singer has just left.But when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me.President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry.They don’t believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people – you know, why are they doing this?You know, because executive orders came about more recently.It was great.I’ll do whatever you want me to do.They’re going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons – the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can’t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in.But itâ€™s very important to me.But weâ€™re doing the right thing.South Korea.You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his U.S. Attorney, his Attorney General.A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.We have a very pro-business group.You are so effective.We will rebuild our roads and bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.I mean, why didn’t they ask about Bill?I’ll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard.How about Florida?He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.No, I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you.Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.The press is so dishonest.They’re gamblers.When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation.So if I took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $6 million, I’ll do that all day long.Now they’re all going, "Wow" because they see what’s happening.As an example, I’ve been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.SO THEY SIGNED A PLEDGE THEY WILL SUPPORT.You’re amazing people.But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person.I have Carl Icahn endorse me.WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING.You know?THE PRESIDENT:  That sounds so good.So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, weâ€™ve really done something.No.Our great American forces are prepared for anything.You, move over.Look, here’s the story.AND BY THE WAY, IF AND WHEN WE WIN, IT IS WE -- I'M JUST A MESSENGER FOLKS, I'M TELLING A MESSAGE OF COMMON STRENGTH BUT I'M JUST YOUR MESSENGER AND I'M DOING A GOOD JOB AS A MAEPGESSENGER, IN ALL FAIRNESS, BUT 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT THEY DO NOW IS STAND THERE WITH BEAUTIFUL EQUIPMENT, GREAT PEOPLE, PEOPLE WALK RIGHT BY THEM.Four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now.Jobs are pouring out of the country.Mexico's going to pay for the wall and it's very easy.Right?We have to know, and we have to know fast.They were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made.Iowa, will you get your numbers up please?They can’t.Go ahead, please ...

TRUMP: Just want to say an amazing place -- South Carolina.Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S. but for all nations.Thatâ€™s okay.Itâ€™s what it is, a disaster.And yet, that’s the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs.She signed a letter and she’s on film.And I got it.This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free.So, Social Security – we’re saving it.And people get what weâ€™re doing.So thatâ€™s one person.You know, all of these politicians that I’m running against now — it’s so nice to say I’m running as opposed to if I run, if I run.She's crooked Hillary.Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that youâ€™ve ever seen in your entire life.We have to build up our military.You don’t need a president with no strength or stamina when we’re being ripped off on trade, we’re being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good.I knew them.This is for a highway.They’re going to have Iraq.He decided to become Don Rickles, OK?I want them back.But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who’s an incredible woman, and she said, "We’d like to endorse you."So theyâ€™ll keep their money.If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.They say they don’t have documents.You like to win.REMEMBER THAT.And weâ€™ll take care of our miners who have been destroyed by this administration, destroyed.I want us all, all of us, to work together.We’re going to have a wall.THEY'LL BUY THEM.I’ll take the credit.THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM.And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.THE PRESIDENT:  I donâ€™t think people are reluctant to come forward.China is so great.â€  You donâ€™t hear that so much anymore.So is Jeb.But she responded to a friend, but she doesn’t respond to an ambassador that’s asking for help.I don’t want their damned oil.Let’s go back.They’re not messing.There was a group on this side.It is time to Believe In America.It’s not going to happen that way anymore.They’re crooked.And you know, in theory you could say "Well, maybe it’s not my thing."A mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clinton’s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests.Millions.Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp.It’s tough.Tom Brady?Leading big in Florida.I don’t want to do that but he’s a very nice person.Dying industries will come roaring back to life.Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won’t say that.Of course, if he writes a bad story, I won’t say that.You know, he’s just better.Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged in many years.But if you look at what’s going on and now on top of that we gave them Iraq because Iran is now taking over Iraq.This is U.S. manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year 2000.Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods.If anybody’s gone to his crusades, they were incredible.So weâ€™re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and weâ€™re already way ahead of anybody else.The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security.And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.What do you need $1 million for?BUT BOBBY CAME OUT AND I CAME OUT AND WE WENT TO A RINAS -- ARENA ARENAS, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE.Steve Bannon has come under â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it.Thank you!I don’t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don’t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.I vote for Obamacare expansions.I think our relationship with Russia will be very good.He could ask about anything you want.Iranâ€™s going to come back to me and theyâ€™re going to make a good deal, I think.But our workers’ loyalty was repaid with betrayal.(Applause.)So that's the way it is.These were real people.We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.That’s ultimately the most important.They are all young people.‘You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.’"
Right?I’d like to finish first.See, what our people don’t know and only somebody that wrote "The Art of the Deal" or does this stuff.And that’s — these are two, so many.I mean, we have a guy that just the other day who said – here they want to blow everything – this is right after Paris.We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total catastrophe.Nobody else gets the really nasty questions.You know, that’s what happens.We’re going to have a strong military.If I got that back, I’d say "Who the hell does he think he is?"During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.I go to people — you can’t even hear.Right?It’s incredible how you did."But the point is, we have to get along.Weâ€™re going to make trade deals, but weâ€™re going to have one-on-one deals â€” bilateral.Thank you very much.We want to have a safe country.American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.We’re going to win so much and we’re going to make America great again.He lived there for four years.I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.All Americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected.They said "Well, they didn’t say they got the money."And if America does what it says, and if your President does what Iâ€™ve been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks.IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM.And I hear their speeches.And then in her personal financial disclosure form, he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks – Citibank and Goldman Sachs.They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.Look, I disavowed.We’ve got four weeks to go, and then we have three weeks after we start.I DIDN'T WANT IRAQ.THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait.Events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.I would certainly prefer not doing that.I asked generals â€” I have them in my office â€” I say, General, please tell me why did they sign that deal.Thank you very much.Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to do.Stick with me.These people are living in hell.You can â€”

Q What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?I said, "What’s Club for Growth?"No issue better illustrates the divide between Americaâ€™s working class and Americaâ€™s political class than illegal immigration.They would love you.You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.I love these countries.I won by almost 20%.And you know what?So this is a great ship and that’s a great state.What’s wrong?But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.You know, it’s interesting.And I said it four times.This is from all over the world.Yes, Jon.Thank you very much.And so it’s very important for me to win Iowa.Okay, they saw bombs.They did not know if they would grow old.Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?Of course, he had some questions also.Q BBC.Isn't that a great thing?WE'RE GOING TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.I’ve fought for my employees.The Tea Party people are incredible people.I THINK SO.MR. SCHWAB: â€” acknowledge that â€”

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I didnâ€™t know about this one.Really good.When Iâ€™m looking â€” some of them had them approved immediately.Deductibles are through the roof.We’re going to make our country so great again.No, it’s true.Well, we’re adding some and we’re adding them pretty rapidly.Right to do oil.We’re not going to lose.And we can get into that but it’s irrelevant.(Applause.)Politicians – remember this – politicians forget, politicians generally aren’t competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that’s what you’re going to end up having.You know, it’s interesting.And something I’m very proud of that I think it’s great and it’s you know really great, it hasn’t gotten very much publicity, hasn’t gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate.She’s the one that started the case.When are we going to stop?They’ll order parts that come in and they’ll assemble them.Of course, they haven’t done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will."Why do you allow that?Yeah.I want to also congratulate the other candidates."We’re going to bring back jobs" – he’s using my same language.He came into my office.We want products made in the country.That's the expression.But it was a wall and they didn’t deal.I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing.BUT BOBBY WAS OUT HERE WORKING REALLY HARD.I don’t like to see people having difficulty.So under President Trump, here’s what would happen:






The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.And that’s what I do like saying about my campaign, I spent less money than anybody else and I have the best results.But, in that case, itâ€™s already in place.The worst commercial and I’m with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives, and I’m saying, "Look over there!Believe it or not, I donâ€™t speak to him very much, but I respect him.If it’s not me in the position, it’s one of these politicians that we’re running against, you know, the 400 people that we’re (inaudible).I like Mike Huckabee but no, I don’t think he’s even going to be there.Can you imagine?It’s so sad.Would you raise your hands please?Q    Thank you, Mr. President.And we also need a cheerleader.They’re specialists.How did it start?But he's totally in favor of Common Core.And I don’t mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right.$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn’t work.AND SOME OF THE FOLKS, I SAW ONE YESTERDAY, I WILL NOT EVEN MENTION NAMES BECAUSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY, RIGHT.With me, nobody is talking about that.I think this is the largest room.THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.(Applause.)However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct.What do you think?So when you think of it — and then they say you’ll never be able to build a wall.(Applause.)And these are countries that have benefited by us greatly.The press, ayeyayay.I guess you’ve heard a little bit about it.Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama’s Department of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.WE WANT TO BE POSITIVE.And he said, "Mr. Trump, don’t even think about it.But this is how dishonest the media is.But you have got to go out and vote.I guess you could say itâ€™s like â€” must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think.They’re going to do something that’s special.And he’s very good at politics.(Applause.)And I told the story the other night for really the first real time.Why can’t our children that are in the country, why can’t they be the dreamers?Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM, FOLKS.And by the way, Iran is getting worse.It’s a very interesting system.In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.I’m funding my own campaign.It’s going to be straightened out.And I will win the Trump University case.I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd.It will save countless dollars, raise workersâ€™ wages, and help struggling families â€” including immigrant families â€” enter the middle class.Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions.It’s not controversial.But I havenâ€™t spoken to her.Theyâ€™re friends of mine....I keep getting these requests.And our theme -- what's our theme?And if I send it back, there’s no letter I can write that’s not going to be insulting to those people, really.We may have to get you a larger room.You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides.But I don’t know anything about them.So remember this.And theyâ€™re going to kill my sister.I said, OK. Then I gave him an answer.You know Henry, right?We lose on everything.That’s not going to happen with the United Nations.I spoke with Mitch McConnell today.So not only did they make a great deal in terms of the Iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them Iraq.I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years.Common core, gone.They’ve taken our money.With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job.I mean, I’m watching your people — I’m watching your people on — and I’m going to be very nice, I’m going to be very nice — I’m watching your people on CNN and I’m watching the Fox people and I’m watching the MSNBC people, too, OK?Weâ€™re going to apply common sense.Who wants — I could stand up here for 50 hours, but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff, right?She’s being protected by the Democrats.It was like a month and a half ago.Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.I only wonder, why didnâ€™t somebody do this like 25 years ago?But they’re going to be gone.I’m the only one on both sides that’s self funding.Are you from Russia?She’s on television all over the world now.I love the jobs of building it.Iâ€™m meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch.And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel.Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy.WE PRAY FOR OUR COUNTRY.We never said this.(Laughter.)It was windchill below zero.To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be.And by the way, arenâ€™t our borders getting extremely strong?I said what’s he doing on television?I don’t want their money.Right?And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group.They get re-elected.Q    What do you think needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country?They system that this country is run under is out of control.About two seconds later, you have escavators digging.And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen.And we will bring back our dreams.WE OWE 19 TRILLION AND GOING TO BE 20 TRILLION OR $21 TRILLION WITH THE OMNIBUS VERY SOON.Theyâ€™re so biased and really is a disgrace.Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.Now, you know, I’ve been a businessman.It’s an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.I want them to come back.And then I said we’re going to win here.Then I think we have the SEC.A couple or more.Even our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.(Applause.)We’re going to change that.Here’s the story.The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle.The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different.WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.Also a great singer but I won’t even mention that because Chelsea would be the last to want to have people know that.You have to use your own because they won’t do anything.But we protect South Korea.You know, we’re in age of Obamacare where nothing exists.Russia â€” this is fake news put out by the media.And even if you get one of these Republicans in, like, I didn’t finish the — so, the wall.THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT COME FROM THE MIGRATION THAT DON'T HAVE PAPERWORK, THAT DON'T HAVE PASSPORTS, THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY'RE FROM.His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did.They fire the people.NOBODY MENTIONED IT.They’re pouring across.You know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone.Right?(Applause.)I don’t think the bad guys are going to say, "Well, I don’t want to break the law.I think they were forced to take them for licensing.Bought a beautiful plane.Yeah.Weâ€™re not going to try and stop, weâ€™re going to stop crime.And they just didnâ€™t do it.Thank you very much by the way.This is some crowd.I want engineers.Millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses.Look, we have 10 topics.We’ve got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands.It’s on the cover of every newspaper.I saw this.And I want to thank all of the loyal people — because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.That is the biggest joke there is in this country.Can you imagine large groups?Thank you very much.Their days are numbered.They are not our friend, believe me.And we did well in Iowa.NAFTA was the worst trade deal in history, and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.And then I walked off and it poured right after I left.When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff.THE PRESIDENT: Well, Iâ€™m talking about Republican.Lives lost, massive moneys lost.Half the people in this room are saying it.Nobody would be even talking about immigration.They’re bringing drugs.They’re bringing crime.Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes.I hear she was a fine â€” really, actually, an incredible young woman.This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again.Thatâ€™s not the question.We have Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl.We have so much energy.We went to, the other night, Iowa — packed.(Applause.)We’re not going to do it anymore.We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.Thatâ€™ll be â€”

Theyâ€™re patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and their families protected.Theyâ€™ve been ripping us for years and he finally saw somebody that understands â€” so itâ€™s one of those â€” (laughter.)But they talk about it.It’s very simple.The inner cities will remain poor.Man, there’s anger.We will bring back our jobs.You'll see that when I file my statements.And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before.I was like the establishment.But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security.And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict.They have cars coming from these massive, massive ships.And they are incredible failures.And I’ll know when – and I’ll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody’s going to mess around.Don’t you agree?What the heck?But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America, to promoting development in other nations.And I must tell you, I don’t know that enough people appreciate it.We should have gotten them years ago.I’ll tell you what, Mexico in a certain way is in a mini-version the new China.AND EVERYBODY WANTED TO SIGN THE PLEDGE.I really don’t know much about it.All those people are now looking for jobs.YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE, FOR A TINY FRACTION, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military.Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.Are you a friendly reporter?There’s no leadership in Washington.Sarah Palin.It doesn’t start for a long time before you even get to it.When I’m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran.You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart.Really great.Mr. President, just to follow up on these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  What does he mean by that?And the wall is going to be a great wall, and itâ€™s going to be a wall negotiated by me.And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States.We’re going to change things around.If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good.â€  I couldnâ€™t have made it sooner because I didnâ€™t know all of the facts.We will make America great again.You don’t have to stand.Not even close.These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he â€” I think he probably respects â€”

From what I hear â€” if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China â€” he was on a good show â€” I wonâ€™t mention the name of the show â€” recently.(Applause.)(Laughter.)(Applause.)And we will use it to light up the world.It’s the noisy majority.Thank you.And heâ€™s still waiting to be approved.The problem is – I mean, they buy apartments.I’m going to stop it.Who could possibly have enthusiasm?And for that reason, I have signed the pledge.As you know, every single poll said I won all three debates.And the banks were just killing him.Melania, say something.ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president.How horrible was that?Okay.Can you imagine if you didnâ€™t have me?If I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right?So it’s called vetting.We shouldn’t have done it.And we’re going to get that straightened out.AUDIENCE:  (Sings â€œHappy Birthday.â€)  (Applause.)Frankly, when I looked at what happened – a friend of mine, who’s a great – you know, one of my great friends, he lives right down – not very far from here.And I knew for a long time these were not good people.You know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets.The U.S., like many other countries, unelected bureaucrats â€” and we have â€” believe me, we have them all over the place â€” and theyâ€™ve imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability.Hire your people they’re not from the United States.And I get along great with Mexico.And I've met so many people.I want to protect our citizens, all of our citizens.You’re going to lose.Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s a criminal penalty.They don’t know where to begin.Thank you very much.There’s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats.Q    This will be my last one â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Should I let her ask another question?But we seem to be doing well.Twitter “SHADOW BANNING” prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.EASY.(Applause.)We owe $19 trillion.Not of me.Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.I mean, I’ve got — and you know, not all bad, but there’s so much dishonesty in the media.I predict, yeah, I think I’m going to get the nomination and I will win the White House.I mean 100 percent.Thank you, Tom.It’s terrible.Well, we’re going to work immediately on repealing Obamacare.That was Chuck Todd this morning on the Today Show.Focus on the real issues.I said I disavow.BECAUSE THEIR RATING IS SO LOW, THEY ARE SO -- THOUGHT OF SO BADLY, IT IS LIKE HOW SMART THE PEOPLE WERE.Q    (Inaudible.)I SAY, MIKE, GO BACK AND TELL THEM, WE'RE NOT CHANGING A DAMN THING.So this is called "The Snake" and I think it’s pretty good.And itâ€™s not a bad term.And they’re wonderful people.Can you believe it?Very soon.Q    Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?Itâ€™s probably going to be the killer of all questions.Thank you.So, Simon and Schuster came up to me.So it started off with me where I was going to talk about trade, I was going to talk about all the things, I was going to talk about the military, building it up.Q    Well, the second question is â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Just sit down.And Carson and others?You know, our vets are incredible.As well as law enforcement officers, police, all across the country.I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts.They want to kill us.And it is probably a much higher number than that, OK?And mine wasn’t.They are not being treated properly.The Transpacific-Partnership is the greatest danger yet.It’s like incredible.They didn’t believe me.So we're now off to Nevada and it's a great state.They can’t make a deal.This has been so incredible.And you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways.You’ve got to do this.Everybody loves it.Heâ€™s done almost as well as you did, Darrell, in college.Sheâ€™s got to make that commitment.And you almost think — I’m not saying that, and I’m not a conspiracy person.But, in recent years, millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.You have to bring this work back to this country.And everybody agrees that we should bring it in.NAFTA was a horrible thing.(Applause.)France has the toughest gun laws in the world.I mean, you know.I was on the right side of that issue – with the people – while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong.I mean, it was totally unique.Didnâ€™t know him.Unnecessary regulations.And they just came back from a, you know, very major defeat yesterday.You watch.One of the first thing I’m going to do is get rid of those gang members.The American economy is by far the largest in the world, and weâ€™ve just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history.And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.But all of the people outside, we’re going to take a bigger place because I feel slightly guilty.So weâ€™re just going to let the other folks come in, fill it up.They’re putting it underground, and that’s actually good environmentally.I donâ€™t think they believe it.And I won New Hampshire, and I wasn’t expected to win it; Jeb was expected to win it.We’re going to make it so strong.(Applause.)All of us.And now Iran wants to start negotiating separately for them.Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda.End — end Common Core.…Well, if they provide bigger dividends, people are going to have more money to spend.The evangelicals have been phenomenal.Q    Forty-eight hours.We’re so far behind.I don’t wear a toupee, and I proved it – I won’t bring anybody up.The worst.And maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn’t know or they didn’t want to talk to the press or they didn’t feel comfortable.You don’t hear it from anybody else.We’re not going to raise the age or we’re not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing.It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans.We’re going to bring education back locally.According to Reuters, according to everybody, Drudge, who’s an amazing guy, by the way.I know that because I buy the product."With all of these characters running.Now, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, theyâ€™re leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside.But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same.And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes.SO WE MADE PROGRESS.You are turning a policy disagreement between two branches of government into an impeachable offenseâ€”it is no more legitimate than the Executive Branch charging members of Congress with crimes for the lawful exercise of legislative power.If it’s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it.You have no idea how honored.I took the risk and I’m glad I did.In my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen.They’re making — you talk about a trade deficit.Q Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Iâ€™m changing it from fake news, though.They don’t even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker.Because the police were not allowed to protect people.But this administration is going to fix that.The factories will remain closed.We don’t know who these people are.Thank you!This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of Americaâ€™s mission and the power of American pride.EVERYTHING IS NIGHT.I did a good job as a messenger, but Iâ€™m a messenger.In fact, the markets have gone up.You have thousands of deaths.In Spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the Grand Marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state.And frankly, weâ€™ll be very happy because itâ€™s actually more money than you can make, under any circumstance, with making a deal.The concept is great.The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.Then we saved the world again.Five of their most coveted killers that have been in jail for eight years in Gitmo, which we’re not closing down by the way.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.You saw the anchor baby thing.I’m self-funding.In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.And we will make America great again.That’s pretty good.They fought with us.How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again?Theyâ€™re letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done.Pretend you didn’t hear that.You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse.If you’ve seen what’s happened, whether you go to South Carolina, where I had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in New Hampshire, tremendous in Nevada, you look at what’s happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all.Q Can I just ask you â€” thank you very much, Mr. President â€” the Trump â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Where are you from?You know whatâ€™s interesting?I would have never given them the money.And every hurting family can find healing and hope.So all over the place, I’m spending millions of dollars.You know?I’ve built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved – always.Itâ€™s all fake news.So this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.I told Mike Pompeo, â€œDonâ€™t let them do that to you.â€  I havenâ€™t given anything.Let them build safe zones.I’m not trying to knock him.That’s how we are.I love you all.And yet, with Marco who was more than 2,000 votes behind me – that’s a lot of votes by the way – they said, "Oh, he’s surging.Beada, thank you very much.What a crowd.I’ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and I’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it’s really not to be believed, hard to imagine what’s happened to our country.THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me.It’s evangelicals.This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.He doesn’t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.Carrier Air Conditioning.LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS UP THERE, FOLKS.Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet.We will build a wall and you know who’s going to pay for the wall – Mexico.The phones don’t work.Why aren’t you doing it?"And, you know, historically, I guess, thereâ€™s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President.It’s true.I fight like hell always because it’s an expense.The future belongs to all of you.Itâ€™s patriotic Americans like you who make this country run, and run well.I mean, they’re like desperate people.(Applause.)But they had to go home.Going to happen.I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost.They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity.And they are ripping us like they’ve never ripped anybody before.Because some of them know that this is just a game that theyâ€™re playing.If somebody squeezed your arm or did something really bad – don’t forget – initially she said thrown to the floor.What are you doing?I would think that you would personally be appalled by these revelations, because in your press conference the day you announced impeachment, you tied the impeachment effort directly to the completely discredited Russia Hoax, declaring twice that â€œall roads lead to Putin,â€ when you know that is an abject lie.He goes and he stands on the floor of the Senate for a day and a half and he filibusters, and these Senators – look, I know.They don’t do that.I know so many of these people.Just give me a podium.It’s no longer pertinent.Criminal cartels.SPEECH 4


  Oh boy.I’m sorry.I heard very early in the morning – nine delegates.Itâ€™s going to be a victory for those who havenâ€™t had reason to hope for a very long time.HE HAD AN EXPRESSION.If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page.I’ve had tremendous success.It should have been you walk in – by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long?They do bad, bad things.Right?Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.So what happened with Walker and I just will finish off with this – he’s a nice man.I’ll give it to you.You know, it’s real estate.And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now.But you have many, many people that are here, that are well-known politicians – they’re governors and they’re senators – but they’re not doing very well.It’s very low.People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him.GOING TO BE AMAZING.There are many other examples.They do a phenomenal job.CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.I don’t want your money.And when I was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before I came in here because I wanted to see exactly where we were before I started speaking, I was amazed at the kind of numbers.Again, he’s not going to win.We won with poorly educated.They’re in terrible shape in the hospitals.Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judgeâ€™s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe â€” including reporters safe â€” and is vigorously defending this lawful order.That’s a positive.THE PRESIDENT: Well, the reporting is fake.And, as you know, the Churchill statue was taken out â€” the bust.But I said, "You like me best."I think it could have been the debate.We will win on everything.So I just want to let you know it’s very important.They’re making a fortune.I want to make -"
And they didn’t believe me.I want to bring money back into this country.Turkey has helped us very much with that whole situation.Many, many bestsellers.They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us.We don’t need low-energy.No, I love them.You see, they were asking – they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way.You’re always talking about your polls.Okay.She was a horrible Secretary of State.I’m not leaving Iowa.Mercedes Benz just left.If there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.We really are searching for peace, but itâ€™s peace through strength.It doesn’t work.The worst.One of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA – general services.And in the city of Miami, where I have so many wonderful friends and projects and employees.You have three women here who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be heard.So you can't have Romney.Too many jobs are being shipped overseas.We’re going to make our country rich again.Our military is so depleted.I don’t want to tell you what my attitude.THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.We’ve got to stop it folks.And we did well.They come to a table and they negotiate.Genesco.WE HAVE OUR CITIES EXPLODING.But you got to know what to do.You know, in the old days everything was better right?But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely.No missiles.Thank you!I’m not watching any of them in particular.These are crimes.I’m sorry."You understand it very well because you’ve been covering it for a long time.And I really like what's happened.Okay.As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troopâ€™s presence and focus on counterterrorism.Oh, we're going to win.She, like others that sheâ€™s working with, feels very, very strongly about womenâ€™s issues, womenâ€™s difficulties, very, very strongly.Leadership.I said, "I can’t take your money.Thank you.And I thought it was good here.Whereâ€™s General Kelly?So what happens is this.For too long, weâ€™ve watched our middle class shrink as weâ€™ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.You know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe – you know, I’ve been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.I see these things that are out of plastic.On North Korea â€” back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement.And we do have something special in a couple of minutes.THE PRESIDENT:  How about a couple of infrastructure questions.Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.Q    Are they liars?A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.Over quickly.He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.Itâ€™s your abuse of power.The tax code is now a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans.We're going to Nevada.They take everything.It’s just going to become worse and worse.We love you all.Not today, not ever.We do have other people.I like him.But years ago, the Republicans and the Democrats – they used to like each other.And it’s another form of let’s stay away from OPEC and let’s stay away from that Middle East stuff.We can’t allow that stuff to happen.Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there’s nobody, nobody that I’ve ever seen – Billy Graham was unbelievable.Right?To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice.Can you imagine all of these guys?Down 61 percent since inauguration.How could he be bad?A couple of them are, you know, at 10%, 11%, or 12%.They just wipe the place out and they could’ve stayed there for longer.We have an understanding of (inaudible).And Kanye West has been so great.Youâ€™ll be hearing about that very soon.I yelled out to bring them back.Q    Why do Nazis like you â€” (inaudible) â€” these statements?SO HERE IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID ON THE 150.It’s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering big league and it’s getting worse.We are going to win with the military.That’s out — we’re starting off; we’re going to want a lot."THE PRESIDENT:  No, Iâ€™ll be reaching out.The wall is 13,000 miles long.That was end of his campaign.Lovely men and women â€” they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.And they called.I want to thank my television star over here.Thank you all very much.It’s a tough game and it’s a nasty game but she’s being totally protected.And they’re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.She was a very successful person.And we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.On receiving this news, Meganâ€™s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.Large corporations changed their business models by exporting jobs to other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, where theyâ€™d make massive profits, and they wouldnâ€™t be paying tax to us either.There won’t be — you won’t have any money left to be — you’ll be paying it in taxes.But Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day.When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly.YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR JOBS BACK.One hundred percent.The Kurds are great fighters.Please.You can’t have a gun unless you’re bad guy, you bought a gun.So when this began, Melania and I and I said, "Got to do it."But we have tremendous support from the Kurds in defeating ISIS.Q There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Not good.But who cares?Not going to happen.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you.Because the waiting now is over.We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us.But I don’t know – I was talking to Scott about this before – I don’t know it’s really appreciated by the voters.Who can build better than Trump?But it could be he’d want to be cool, and he’ll wait until the next day.I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.Remember this: Our educational system is a mess.I talked about a lot of things.They hit the lotto, okay?And then — and then — and that was it.And it’s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly.That means I’m going to get it done.So we get nothing.Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion.We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.I have to thank Jeff Sessions – Sen. Jeff Sessions – one of the most respected men or people in Congress.Come on.Right?IT IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO SOME OF THE MASSIVE TRADE DEALS.And I told them I’m going to stop it.THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE.You want to get your schools better, you better get rid of Common Core fast.Okay?And it’s because of China.I mean â€”

Q    (Inaudible.)And he has had a tremendous career.I’m doing well.No so good, right?THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, you.In fact, they have signs â€” â€œHeâ€™s Kept His Promise.â€  Theyâ€™re all over the place.But Israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they’ve done.I wanted to call him.Q    David Duke was there.If you look at the horrible statements, like â€œWay to go, Page.I donâ€™t want to be in a position where people say, â€œNo, thanks.All right.And you have â€” you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent.He thought he was such – his career – in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened.These are patriots.Q    A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money thatâ€™s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.From now on, we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies.It was the same as in Florida.Get over here, boom.And I understand that.Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?Everybody knew that.They say they want to run against me — first of all, I’m winning and tied in the polls now and I haven’t even hit her yet.So they’re way down.We are run by people who in so many words – I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word.Common Core.And you know, my whole fame is and I’ll say it once.We have so much potential.And since then Iâ€™ve watched many other people say that.That’s easy for me.Now is the time for bipartisan action.THEY LET HER GO.Ukraine is going to be fine.It has turned out to be a disaster.I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children.You saved me in so many ways.AND SHE SAYS, WE DON'T LIKE HIS TONE.We’re going to be a much bigger party.We will support Israel 1,000%.Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.We want jobs.And I believe we’re going to have some more coming in.Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war.Same thing – on June 16th, I announced we’ve got to stop illegal immigration.But I’ll tell you what I also want.We are going to make America so ... ...
We are going to win again.You watch.No more testing of nuclear.(Applause.)Thatâ€™s some group.He couldn’t answer the question.We don’t win anymore.Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.I mean, it’s a money-making industry, OK?Remember the heat I took with illegal immigration?But it’s sealed, it’s beautiful.This is a special state.They wanted to get rid of ICE.So we have to fight for the Second Amendment.But that has nothing to do with this; Iâ€™m representing the United States.AND THE PRESS, I WILL TELL YOU -- THE PEOPLE BACK THERE, AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS, NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE THE MOST DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS ON THE EARTH.So, he made a statement, and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great.Theyâ€™re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.Do I know how to build infrastructure?Okay?(Applause.)Iâ€™ve gotten a real glimpse â€” during the campaign, Iâ€™d go around with Ben to a lot of different places that I wasnâ€™t so familiar with.THE PRESIDENT: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.We need it more than ever.We love the country.We’re lowering taxes, which Republicans love.They make a billion dollars a day.But largely.We won with old.I don’t need money.Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare.You look at Black unemployment.This building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didn’t see that in the construction trades.And you know, Hillary – was Hillary missing today?MS. PATTON:  Hi, how are you?That means they're more powerful than you are.And happy holiday.(Laughter.)(Applause.)No, no.He’s very nice, good guy.Mr. President, I want to â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.Weâ€™re going to be working closely together to deliver for you, the citizens of Tennessee, like youâ€™ve never been delivered for before.We send them beef and they don’t even want it.He’s surging."It’s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity.Q    Right.By the way, itâ€™s 300 percent.â€  So you donâ€™t send it in, because you canâ€™t compete.Well, we meant we’re working on it.THAT'S GOING TO END.I love Billy Graham.I want to thank my staff – both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what we’re doing currently, my staff where we’re running for the presidency.Nobody believed that I was going to run.With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.But let me tell you Mexico is going to pay for the wall, right?They were mean.So I said, good.We give you seats.Q    Where is it?Q    So, please explain â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Fake news.Could be 50 [million]…
But we have to get them out.A lot was done in the first summit.If I win, we will have victories all over.But people are fed up.Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country is going to be just like it says on that beautiful red hat â€” it says: Make America Great Again.And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesnâ€™t sound wrong.And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received.I mean, this guy was a moron.Q    How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™ve been accused.That can’t be possible.So then, as you know, North Korea is a big problem.What they've done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world.A tremendous deal with South Korea.It’s not going to happen.That’s the choice we face.It’s been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far.But she said "If you actually say -"
So the NBC guys come up – terrific people.I said, I just heard it.The hats – it’s going crazy.And I have the best results because in most polls I’m number one.She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself.A poll just came out in Florida where I’m leading big.(Laughter.)I only say that you have to look at the facts.And it didn’t work.That’s why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP “in its current form,” – ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity.They’re all calling me too.A big fat con.At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.Everybody stayed right ’tis the end.We have artificially low interest rates.And I see it.And by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular.I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH THEM.I can see why.Remember that.And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China.(Laughter.)Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross.I thought, "Oh, they’re going to find indie."Phenomenal.I’ve shown that for a long time.Since then, our tax laws have tripled in size, and the tax code itself now spans more than 2,600 pages, and most of it is not understandable.He thought I was kidding.I will tell you.A lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money.I said, "Phil I don’t want your money.My first day in office Iâ€™m going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last 10 years.I gave $50,000 or $100,000.The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops.They never asked us for that.â€  Nobody has ever said, â€œYou should pay.â€  These are really wealthy countries.Number one, we give them a lot of money.No, you know, it is amazing.A lot of people up there can’t get jobs.They want to live.I was 17th.You look at the fields and you look at everything, it’s so beautiful.I’m more militaristic than him.I told them, â€œIâ€™m not happy with OPEC.â€  We take care of all these people, we defend them.He’s at what 3%?(Applause.)They took money in order to say bad things.I’m with everybody.Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border.I have 145 judges.They’re getting a deal that’s going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think.And we’re going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific.Judahâ€™s family braced for the absolute worst....Honestly, it’s dishonest reporting.AND WHEN WE EXPLAIN TO THE HEADS OF CARRIER THAT HERE IS THE STORY, EITHER STAY OR IF YOU WANT TO GO TO MEXICO, WE WISH YOU A LOT OF LUCK BUT WHEN YOU SELL YOUR AIR-CONDITIONERS, YOU ARE GOING TO PAY A 35% TAX FOR THE AIR-CONDITIONERS TO COME ACROSS THE BORDER.We can’t let people kill us.And itâ€™s a criminal penalty.We have people that don’t know what they’re doing."Oh, Trump?They said thereâ€™s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.They pay me millions and millions.(Applause.)Take a look at his past.If you’re single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 – so, very important.We love our country.How are you?People say, "Mr. Trump, what’s your attitude on ISIS?Our politicians live by a different standard and I think that shouldn’t happen.Weâ€™re making our military protection a little bit better for us too.It’s a talent.I was like the fair haired boy.And hopefully, that will be â€” heâ€™ll be approved very, very quickly.I actually think it’s going to be more money than that.But anyway, so we protect Japan.We’re being laughed at all over the world.THE PRESIDENT: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I donâ€™t think he did anything wrong.I like honest reporting.I have to go down and say hello.This was not supposed to be one in question.That was an election he should have won and he lost.Puts people in there – mastermind – bing, bing, bing, it’s like shooting everybody.That hasn’t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades.ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran.He’s not a smart person.They think it’s $2.5 trillion.Boom.Now she hurried home from work that night.Q    All right.It’s your name.But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does.You’ve got to build a wall.The communities along this historic route were a vivid symbol of Americaâ€™s booming industry.Believe me.In one way, she’s running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins that’s the end of that.I think â€” I have it right here â€” I think that what weâ€™ve done behind the scenes, which nobody really knows about â€” and I donâ€™t blame you for not knowing about, you know, personal letters, private letters.But if she’s allowed to run, honestly, it’ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong.These are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage.They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.So, I’m on the front page of the New York Times.I feel awfully good.To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade.It will be lifted — this ban — when and as a nation we’re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country.Sheâ€™s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.I know.And the reason I’m getting that — and I’m going to do great with the Hispanics.I mean nobody’s ever spent money on ads against me.So I had vision in 2004 – Reuters – actually it was before that but they wrote a story.The United Nations is not a friend of democracy.It's an incredible movement with incredible people.All night long.Like this isn’t Trump.No, Iâ€™m working on it very hard.That was below the average rate for developed countries at the time.This is one room that really does know how it works.She was just at Fortune Magazine for like something like Woman of the Year which is great…But Ivanka is going to be very involved and Melania is going to be very involved very soon.And you know what?I do it really well and all that stuff, but itâ€™s possible I wonâ€™t be able to get along with Putin.They are devaluing down to nothing.I look forward to that very much.Q    But within your administration?Well, there is gridlock in Congress right now and that’s because there’s no leadership at the top.He knew how to get things done.Well, they cut the "country" out so it’s referring to Iowa....It’s an honor to be here.Theyâ€™re going to have a chance to speak at a major â€” they have a major chance to speak.We all know it.It wonâ€™t be my people.When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.A person has a baby, lives in Mexico or lives in Asia or lives in many different place, has a baby, walks across the border, has the baby here.You know that.Usually I do a double.So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.And, you know, when they asked Kerry and Obama, the deal was made.Remember that – low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets – Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Ave., land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over.Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.I love the country, I love the country.The best Republican Presidents have not only been warfighters, but also peacemakers.This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty.It’s a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly.Thatâ€™s fine.Thank you.I love the Hispanic people.We leave and boom it comes apart.Now, [Bill] Kristol’s the one that’s – but he’s the last one.It is a simple answer.Thank you, thank you.I want ISIS to surrender.When you think of it.And it’s true.It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities.SHE IS THE ONE THAT CREATED IT WITH STUPIDITY, WITH STUPID, STUPID POLICY.By the way, the new President has been great.The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock.Forget it.We have a president who in seven-and-a-half years has doubled the debt."We’re doing our show live from the White House or something".Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me.We love you and we're going ahead to Nevada.We’re terminating Common Core, and you will see something that’s magic.We’re here constantly.Sit down.I hope that itâ€™s going to all work out.There’s tremendous drugs pouring across the border.We’re going to see.If it doesnâ€™t work out, it will be a tremendous waste of time, energy and money.So, I really – it’s an honor to be with you folks, I can tell you.Everybody else isn’t.And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will.I mean, you look at it, it’s tremendous abuse.I’m very proud to say that we’ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that’s also a record.And I like it because then it shows how big the crowds are.(Applause.)So this was not easy getting this in.Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.She shouldn’t be allowed to run.So we have to make great deals before we do anything with Cuba or anybody else, right.You’ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place.They don’t have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should’ve taken.And you know, there’s the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, "Are you going to vote for Trump?And you make me look very bad.He’s got no credibility.Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe itâ€™s doing very well.So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before.Because he was a major slave owner.Thatâ€™s very nice.The process has begun from day one.You lose $500 billion a year with China.One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if it’s Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country.It actually works.We will make our communities wealthy.America must do more — much more — to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in Orlando.It canâ€™t get any worse.Youâ€™re right â€” that could have been a world war very easily.We have tremendous illegal immigration problems.We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly.I’m using my own money.Now, I don’t know if you saw his recent release.But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.And now I’m leading everything and I did okay in Iowa.Weâ€™re going home.And we can build it and we can build it right.Although I have to tell you, we have General Kelly here today, and we stopped 78 percent â€” going up to 80 percent â€” on the border traffic coming through, in just a short period of time.And I was witnessed to the carnage over the last six weeks especially.We’re going to bring back the jobs.I just met him and I can tell you.Turned out to be a total lie.Maybe we’re not supposed to get into that fight.She said, "People don’t believe you’re going to run."And what happened?These rooms werenâ€™t designed for this many people.We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others.I promise.African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.Now, it has to go through Congress and, you know, a lot things have to happen.It’s under siege.Again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, not too many people.And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do.Theyâ€™ve been decimated.Youâ€™ve seen what theyâ€™ve done over the last long number of years.You know, I think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time I spent and for the amount of money I spent.I’m the frontrunner by a lot.Q    Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville.They don’t buy it.But I’ll tell you what, whether she is or not, she doesn’t have the strength or the energy to help Israel.And some, I assume, are good people!It takes – because you have to vet each company.Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China â€” right smack in the middle â€” is phenomenal.Club for Growth.Weâ€™ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.We can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.Not going to happen.This is one of many but a judge that doesn’t want to do a number on the guns and that doesn’t know how important it is.It’s been amazing for me, even from an educational standpoint.Q We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it.Then Obama announces because he’s so predictable "We are leaving on a certain date in a year."It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs.We’re going to win because of Wisconsin, I hope...We’re going to make America great again.Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.Right?It canâ€™t get â€” honestly, it canâ€™t get â€” thatâ€™s so nice, thank you.And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship thatâ€™s 30 miles offshore right out of the water.It’s true.And some of them are like third world countries.You know that very well.So I just tell you this.We’re broke.There is no limit.Nobody’s spent more time with the vets that are running.Can’t be her.Who’s military here?(Applause.)Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.THE PRESIDENT: Iâ€™m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.I love you.I know friends that have had false charges.I’m self-funding.It got worse.Well, they’ve treated me nice.Q    And, Mr. President â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  But Canada has treated us very badly.Thank you.You look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have.And somebody that when I heard that she was going to endorse me, I was so honored.Everybody said "Skip Iowa".And the reason I said it can be possible because nobody could be foolish enough to allow a thing like that.We have no choice.I think Putin probably assumes that he canâ€™t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.They were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to, you know, get involved.And it affects Iowa so much.You know, some of the gangs in LA.And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.You know, that was about two months before.Heaven’s why?You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?And when I was in Iowa last week, I said "What do you think?I said, how's business?We owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount – $1.4 trillion.You know, if I wanted to have your money, I think I’d have a damn good chance and I think I’d get more money than anybody else.He’s fighting me all the time.You do a very good job.They said "Donald Trump was disappointed".I watched all – "Oh, I pay so much tax.It’s unheard of in primetime television.But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what theyâ€™re supposed to be doing.So, years ago – many years ago – like I hate to say 40 but I won’t say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville.And I know them.Boeing is building a plant over here.They donâ€™t like it.But I’m just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens – they become weak.I’m the least spent money.Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.We will make our country strong again.No, I think just work.There’s something going on with him that we don’t know about.And don’t worry, they never pan the crowd.American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe, and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives.We’re going to win so much — we’re going to win a lot.So we are going to give you – we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex.Q    Iâ€™m asking you â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco?So all of a sudden, everyone’s saying "Wow"…and from almost at the beginning, you’ve seen I’ve been at the top like from almost day one.THE PRESIDENT:  â€” and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win.37%?You get it from South Korea.He talks about fixing the VA.We were almost 800,000.Our country will thrive and prosper again.If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along â€” and donâ€™t forget, weâ€™re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.That’s what a deal is.For me.As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.Don’t you?"They’re fed up with stupid people.The heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted.DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.Iâ€™ve created over a million jobs since Iâ€™m President.So that would be a second national emergency.You know, these are the greatest people.THEY DON'T WANT TO BRING SOMETHING ELSE TO COMPLICATE IT.We owe them $1.7 trillion.YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN ORLANDO.A talk show."I was jolted backwards.And if you’re there illegally and if you overstay your bound?But I’ll do the fundraisers in the White House.Go.But I do appreciate that.It will be a big, big cut.Right?You saw that yesterday.We are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it.I don’t want you to read it."I don’t think so.TRUMP: The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to screen.The reason – one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending.Including Hillary Clinton.So many victories that are going to be coming out…In fact, you might get tired of victories.In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding â€” 250 years since the day we declared our independence.We don’t know what we’re doing.The forgotten men and women of our country will never be forgotten again, believe me.You have the inner city problems that have been going on for ever.And itâ€™s not.It’s going to get worse and worse.Better than having trucks going down the road and everything else.You know why?You could be rich.So, we are going to make our country so great.OK?They all wanted to be here but they’re with Ivanka now and that could be, certainly, within the next week.Why am I going to give them $1 million?So he’s sort of got the worst of all elements.And after theyâ€™re out of business, theyâ€™ll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.Conservatives want the Keystone Pipeline.We got to reduce it.Well, look, Gary Johnson, he got 1% of the vote last time.And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.(Applause.)We will make America wealthy again.When I see somebody like Jeb – no I’ll tell you one thing I respect.But it’s so wrong.I win at golf.I see him name....Yeah, it’s called the statute of limitations, right?They were laughing at the Secretary of State of this country.Police and sheriffs are members of our community.AND WE'RE IN WORSE SHAPE NOW THAN WE WERE 15 YEARS AGO BEFORE THE WHOLE DEAL STARTED.You would be laughed out of the country so fast.I give him an answer, I blow him away.He writes me a letter asking for $1 million.They’re too cunning.It’s all about jobs.So it's a real, real disaster.It just doesnâ€™t work that way.And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters.Thank you.Tough cookie.But you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person.Well, I think the big thing that’s changed is – and it’s been obvious to all – number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship.But so I think we’re going to do – we’re doing really well with the evangelicals...
And by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness.Q    But â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I wish it could have gone quicker.Go ahead, in the back.So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion â€” and this year, itâ€™s going to be pretty big too, because thereâ€™s few things more important than our military.They have so much power because we owe them $1.5 trillion and they send all those cars."He said, huh, thatâ€™s fine, thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re supposed to do.It could be but I doubt it.Until we find out.And I’m not a politician fighting.Thank you so much.Nine downgrades.NASCAR.But one of the polls came out because in South Carolina and North Carolina, I’m leading really big.They’re coming at all of us.In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.You dare to invoke the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this election-nullification schemeâ€”yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for Americaâ€™s founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build.We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.With Mexico, we will build a wall.She was Person of the Year.I know that my life will continue.But I watch others too.Thank you everybody.Q You are the President now.Did you see the picture?Iâ€™m sure in that group there were some bad ones.And if she doesnâ€™t do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office.But the facts are on Bush’s side and ultimately I think Marco’s going to be hurt very badly.And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.They’re coming at all of us.Big deal....We’re doing really well.I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests.We don't win on trade.Itâ€™s unbelievable.I’m saying, "Isn’t the grass beautiful?You know, they shoot first, they talk later.He’s not going to run."That one is going to be fun.So it’s a great question.But I have ask you folks to explain the status of that.But this is just an unbelievable woman.I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.But you were there.So letâ€™s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.He’s the one that fought currency devaluation.And if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re fighting, youâ€™re not going to fight it very well.I’ll be the great at the military.And we’re getting rid of a lot of things.And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they’re stabbing Israelis, and even Americans.We can’t let it happen anymore.You know, I go to Dallas.They know I was joking.They closed down all the streets.I mean, if she was, her face stayed the same.America must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.We used to hear theyâ€™re all leaving.And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well.He â€” he didnâ€™t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.Heâ€™s a friend of mine.Q    Yes, Mr. President.In fact, Iâ€™ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five oâ€™clock on Saturday, and I heard â€” just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.Okay?Of the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers – can you believe this?Weâ€™re going home.We have to talk to them.Just a quick follow-up.I mean, it’s not a contest between the two of us, just so we understand.But they’ve already found it.They looked at us.When you look at this crazy Iran deal where we’re paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they don’t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means.Iâ€™ve seen thousands of plants and factories close.You see whatâ€™s happening.Always have been.They probably will.Okay?They actually get it, but they donâ€™t write it â€” letâ€™s put it that way.I mean, maybe it’s not working but it’s better than Jeb right?"I mean, every time he raises his head and he starts talking, every single time he raises his head, our ships start floating over, our planes start going over.Okay?It will be fair.OKAY?We have a tremendous trade deficit with you.I know that.Might be 5 million.If you win, if you lose, it doesn’t matter.I’m really rich.You’re going to see what we’re going to do.And Hillary is a weak person.They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse.And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.Q    Yeah.The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because theyâ€™re there â€” because we have our new people going in place right now.I don’t care.He actually put out a tweet tonight.I will only tell you this.This country is going to start winning again.My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independence.I’ve seen the parents.You have some reporter named Jacobs.Youâ€™re going to like this.Yes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques.But I am.Then they said, "Oh, he’ll never file his form whatever."...But the motorcycle guys love Trump.And they’re calling me.In actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that Univision, previously my friend, went ballistic.You know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans – wouldn’t it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again?I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?My wife said "If you run, you’re going to win" because she understands that I like people – I love people and people love me.They’re all talking about doing it, and you don’t have to.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good.But until we secure our border, theyâ€™re going to keep streaming right back in.Say, â€œHey, how you doing?â€  Okay?Would you get these numbers up?And I promise, if they turn negative, I’m not going to be talking about them.Not going to happen.Q Can we ask what youâ€™re doing to do?You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states.Now, if you have a company where you’re losing $400 billion, you’ve got to do something very fast.Are you a Kurd?The married couple.I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens.All of our communities, every single one of them.We donâ€™t like bad news, right?We can’t even go there.And we’re going to change it around.Can you believe it?Thank you.We have great stuff.And thank you very much.They wouldn’t be able to build it.The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster.They said, "They said they will never pay for the wall."We’re going to have borders again.She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy.USA!Beautiful land.Okay?If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials.You have Japan.Hopefully, we never have to use it.Why do you need a second summit with the North Korean leader so soon?In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.Q Thank you.And most importantly, we will make our country great again because that’s what it’s all about.We’ve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business.They were talking about the Department of State, State Department, and they said very strongly, you know, the things that they’ve done.I want a job."He knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didn’t change.I was speaking to a couple of them.They want to work, they want to make the country great.And I loved it.They donâ€™t talk about that one, but that was, to me, pretty bad.So they killed 128 but many more are dying right now.I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.Now, I donâ€™t know that weâ€™re going to make a deal.And I think if you people will say I’m the one that came up with the term "rigged".Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again.They would like to see me lose an election because theyâ€™ve never been challenged like this.I’ve been a job-producer.Itâ€™s time.Because I’m so excited, because we have so much potential.(Applause.)Now, they’re talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better.On energy policy, America First means opening up America’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers, including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration.That’s a lot of money for a guy you’ve never met before.Crazy thing.And we’re going to meet and we are going to have something that’s going to be really fabulous.I mean, I think most of you can cover that.So we’re going to protect the Second Amendment if I’m president.No, but I’m totally for it.President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011.Thank you.Nobody has done the job that weâ€™ve ever done.We will defeat ISIS overseas.The good news is he doesnâ€™t have good ratings.And it’s a huge humanitarian problem.You’ll never really run for politics.The Times, I think theyâ€™re going to endorse me.I will be America’s greatest defender and most loyal champion.Thatâ€™s some numbers.With that being said, you know, I have a good chance of winning because you look at what’s going on.Who’s better than me?I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father.Not even close.And you’re going to remember the evening because we’re going to start winning again.So, I don’t have a lot of the people coming to me.Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, â€œHow about a fine?â€

And when I asked President Xi, I said, â€œDo you have a drug problem?â€  â€œNo, no, no.â€  I said, â€œYou have 1.4 billion people.Not even close.That’s great.But we’re also going to get jobs for people that are here.Now, they’re going into Yemen.Is that correct?I spoke to Putin twice.So many happy veterans.Thatâ€™s what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll have control for a long time.MR. SCHWAB:  Thank you.You’d never forget."CAN'T BE ANY WORSE.And if she does it, you see what happens every time there’s even a thought of raising them just a little bit.I don’t know.I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit.We’re trademarked.Thank you.What you have to have is people have to know who it is.What she did is a criminal act.Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m doing.We’ve got to get it done.I didnâ€™t want to meet anybody else.Now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys, they were also very weak and somewhere — but here is my ad.And weâ€™ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.And then you found out there’s tremendous crime.And they’re people that, you know, look when they call me I’ll treat them with respect but I’m not going to be doing bad things if it’s bad for the country.And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack.It’s going to happen.Our leaders don’t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much.Believe me, folks.We have no idea where these people are coming from.I don’t have time to be political.Oh, they treated him pretty rough though.And we’re going to get it.I hardly know her.Very simple.They took over Iraq.Not sustainable.After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.I’d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solitarily with the people of Orlando who have come under this horrific attack.In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it.Q    You were asked earlier in the news conference by my friend from Sky News about the message that you are sending to â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.It’s not.Theyâ€™re getting other things.I’ll be watching them on Tuesday night.It's corrupt.But you will be getting a total star.Q    Mr. President, you always say you support your allies.We’re going to do it by putting America first.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.And I said, "You know, I never heard a politician call another politician liar so we can do it."They say the loser of the night was Marco Rubio and it’s true.Q    Mr. President, just to finish really fast.I don’t know why I didn’t think of it sooner.Because we need money.You know, the slogan is "Make America Great Again" and I’m adding "Make America Great Again and Safe Again" because we don’t feel safe anymore.We have a country that’s not protected.If I build it, it’ll be taller, better, and less.THE PRESIDENT: Good.And you know, for years, they would fight.But what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists.So you can say what you want, but thatâ€™s the way it is.Theyâ€™re going to love it.Youâ€™re going to have nobody.And theyâ€™re not treated the way they should be.Youâ€™ll see.Because we have to do it.I would say itâ€™s a spirit like I have never witnessed before.Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or I’m not showing up.I could have built it for four or five million dollars without the permitting process.We’re going to create jobs.People are going to come into this country but they’re going to come in legally.We need some pomp and circumstance.Because if you look at what’s going on and you look at the tremendous crime and you look at the drugs that are pouring across the border, it’s – the drugs are pouring like water.We have no border.Thank you very much.All right.Now, they take our money.But when I’m president, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, enjoy yourselves, don’t eat too much turkey.But if they don’t say yes, you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk....I had a crowd 7,000 people last week.We have $4 trillion in the various places.We’re going to put America back to work.He signed that.I’m telling you, folks, we’re being led by stupid people.So thatâ€™s the extent.Now they’re saying, "These guys are – they’re dirty fighters."Would anybody like it from the media?(Applause.)Weâ€™re also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against Communist oppression.He was vibrant.There’s too much — it’s like — it’s like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.Yes, maâ€™am.We have to win.The other group didnâ€™t have a permit.Corporate inversions.So hereâ€™s the story, folks.How’s Rubio doing?As we all know, our Gulf Coast was hit over the weekend with a devastating hurricane of historic proportion.And she said, "We’d have two people here.Probably tops the $6 million number.But Iâ€™m honored that theyâ€™re here.Sounds like a lot, but itâ€™s not so much, although weâ€™re putting it to much better use than it used to be.Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.And I said, they fight, they’re always fighting for decades and decades, for generations.They are the worst.I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism.James.(Applause.)And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good.And I’m very proud of it.And you know, Wisconsin.You know, my hands are normal.You look at Asian unemployment.Weâ€™re going to put our miners back to work.And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?A feat that Monmouth University’s Patrick Murray’s highly respected pollster called "astounding".So I say here’s what we’re going to do.How did Trump get it?"They’re a terrorist state.[Chris] Christie, by the way.But they would put nice political people at the border.And, I donâ€™t know, we have so many more.It’s wonderful.…Anyway, so here I am.But then they said, "Oh, well he announced."We have so many happy groups.Q    â€” the 2018 midterm elections.The horror is beyond description.Like a Jack Nicklaus.So now I’m here to talk to the people of Wisconsin.The tone is such hatred.You’re special.You would love the people."I won’t win.AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Booo â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  By the way â€” watch what happens.THE PRESIDENT:  Youâ€™re with who?Itâ€™s why Americaâ€™s future has never been brighter.MR. TRUMP, NEVER FORGET THE ANSWER, THE WALL IS VITAL.And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.Can you believe it?Now, it’s one of the big subjects.Weâ€™re covering everything â€” all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldnâ€™t be done, whether it was theft or anything.And it has been indeed carnage.Right?I can only tell you what he â€” now, he was replaced long before the election.We love Nevada.But when Jerry was so strong and so great.Why can’t we just keep our mouths shut?Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.They didn’t talk about her foundation.How come you signed the letter?"(Applause.)You look at what China's doing to us, what Japan does to us, what Mexico is just killing us at the border -- at the border and with trade.And on that one, they said, â€œHe was too soft with President Putin.â€  I had a great meeting with the President.He’s a big excavator.When the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win.But we see by the lines – the lines go down to Park Avenue.You have Cruz at 20% and Carson at 16% and going down and Rubio at 11% and Bush at 4%.You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness.HE ENDORSED ME FROM NASCAR, RIGHT.You do have other people, and your ratings arenâ€™t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.Fox, 62 percent — Fox Las Vegas, 62 percent.It’s going to be a real wall.Our people are incredible.But I will win the Trump University case.Itâ€™s a con job.We have $2.5 trillion offshore at least.I donâ€™t know if you heard that.We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.That’s a great feeling.The problem that we have is that the leaders of Mexico, Japan, and China and every other country that we do business with, they’re smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders.I would have given – just so you understand.Why aren’t we embargoing?One gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000.And weâ€™ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do thatâ€™s much better than the Paris Accord.They’re just too smart."How does it feel?On energy policy, America First means opening up America’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this Administration.I mean, honest.They can’t get it in.$150 billion.We are one nation â€“ and their pain is our pain.I was all over the place tonight.So we do not go abroad in the search of war.7/11/2016






6/28/2016


It is great to be here.No, not all of you.Didnâ€™t want to take it that far.Because again, I’m the only one that’s self-funding my campaign.It doesn’t have to be this way.But they kept saying, "He’s plateaued....People in your world are saying they possibly could.A really great one.Remember that.And I’m not going to beat around the bush and "Oh, let’s talk and let’s be nice and let’s say – " Nobody can do it like I do it.But if you go â€” as an example, youâ€™re CNN â€” I mean, itâ€™s story after story after story is bad.They call it an NBC monkey poll.Our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world.And they quit looking.So one thing that I felt it was very important to do â€” and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for â€” well, maybe a little bit â€” than reporters, than good reporters.Yeah, it is.I love you people.You know why?Because, believe me, the enemy doesn’t want to be killed.That was very normal.So Chris, who’s a friend of mine, he hit me hard.But they agree and they can’t get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership.Our country spends our money so stupidly and I will tell you that I could speak for myself I pay a lot of tax but I fight like hell to make it as low as possible.You ever see her 18-minute speech?I’ve done a good job.But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn’t show up for the people of Florida, and I don’t think he should be doing that.In a way â€” and Iâ€™ve been saying this for a long time â€” theyâ€™ve been sort of the forgotten people, but theyâ€™re not forgotten any longer.Now, I could do this.We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.I don’t know what it is but they like me.Mr. Jones gets a bigger dividend, he’s going to have more money to spend in the economy.We admit many more, and that’s just the way it is.They’ve never seen anything like it.Itâ€™s not going to happen.Iâ€™m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down.Club for Growth – a friend of mine, he’s a conservative guy.Wait, wait.Do you understand that?The decision is ours to make.I went up 11 points.Thereâ€™s no nuclear testing and thereâ€™s no testing of rockets.They don’t have it.We're going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks.How do you spend $1 million doing a soccer field?THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE.When I get finished with the Keystone, they’ll be happy and we’ll be happy.THE PRESIDENT:  Which one?On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.I’ve fought for my business.But you know I have a great policy plan and I’ve gotten a lot of credit for it and it’s on DonaldJTrump.com.We have a writer.They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal -â€“ or JCPOA â€“- and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place.And yet that’s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.Thank you.Well, he’s left the race so I feel pretty good about that.We’ll come back.Ask Boeing.And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.And I said that’s just incredible.We started, I was one of 17 people – senators, governors.I say that.But it’s so sad to see what’s happening.We just left Iowa.(Laughter.)Great guy.Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.I really do.It was amazing.An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there.Now, they’ll probably say initially "No".I don’t want them to know.We’re going to stop it cold.Everyone says, "Oh, Trump is going to be very tough."And we're going to bring them back.Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays.I donâ€™t know.They didn’t know the room was too big, because they didn’t have anybody there.This could go on forever.Now, I knew the process very well â€” probably better than anybody.That is how we will all succeed and grow together, as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious American destiny.I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.AND I SEE HILLARY CLINTON SAID, I DO NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S TONE.And France — I mean, you get caught with a gun, it’s — the only one that has guns are the bad guys.But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.The numbers that you gave are wrong.Beada will send me some money.We're not going to have a fight.But they still want to live.But you know what?I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein.You know in many ways, it’s the cheapest thing you can do.Do you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed?Q Did you fire Mike Flynn?Weâ€™ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.Thatâ€™s why it hasnâ€™t been done in close to 40 years.We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.Is there a national intelligence estimate, for example, that youâ€™re prepared to put forward?THE PRESIDENT:  Who are you?The enthusiasm, it was unbelievable to see.But that’s okay.(Applause.)I’m also going to renegotiate some of our military costs.It is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I’ve ever seen of any kind.The information was provided by â€” who I donâ€™t know â€” Sally Yates â€” and I was a little surprised because I said, doesnâ€™t sound like he did anything wrong there.World War I levels.So we get a traitor.So with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say we’d just go through.I like the Keystone Pipeline too.They have to do it.And then we have all the strikes.Oh, great.The absolute cheapest thing you can do.When I gave that answer, they say – although some people – I see it here – some people say "We love that.Q    Roberta Rampton from Reuters.I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville.Look where we are now.They’re too smart.…The best thing that I’ve seen in going around and the thing that I’ve seen more than anything else is how smart the people are.Clintonâ€™s entire campaign rests on using a single tactic, and itâ€™s not working very well.And all of the different state – Connecticut.The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities.The real country, our real country â€” the people that really love our country, they love you.He’s trying to make you – he’s trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts.Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute.Am I going to say he’s doing a great job?I mean, Christians, evangelicals, we’ve done so well.I think we’re going to support somebody else."You’ve seen that.That’s all they do.Stand up, Steve.For me, it was like a picture.We have the opposite thinking.Why do they have to develop them?We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban â€” (applause) â€” thank you â€” and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.His show is dying and he keeps saying do it, do it, but I never liked it.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.For a person like me, I mean, it’s very exciting.We’re going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad.I don’t even know.They have police that say, "You know you have one day left."It is a horrible, horrible way to think.And itâ€™s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and itâ€™s unacceptable.But remember this.A lot of the money when it was sent out, different people would call.And what did we do?I have no anything.Everyone is looking â€” itâ€™s the second time heâ€™s been introduced.You know, these politicians, all talk, no action.They didnâ€™t know anything.They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country.You know?I didn’t expect it.And on ISIS, likewise, almost at 50 percent.Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.You had nine downgrades.We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes.Slightly large, actually.Theyâ€™re very dishonest people.We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money.So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important.I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security.Weâ€™ll have new deals.I think he’ll be a great cheerleader for the country.Handle China."Day one.We mourn as one people for our nation’s loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it.These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers, not just in the U.S., but around the globe.I really believe the Iran deal.Weâ€™re going to make great deals.I was all set to have the meeting.I don’t like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody.Wow.I agree with that.Many laws.What are you talking about?We’ve got to be smart.They didn’t take the oil.That’s Donald Trump.I like him...We’re going to start winning again, folks.Always I heard, â€œYouâ€™re innocent until proven guilty.â€  Iâ€™ve heard this for so long, and itâ€™s such a beautiful phrase.IT'S A RIGGED SYSTEM.Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG â€” Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible.And I have many of these people vetting the people getting the money and working hard.And it was a rough time as you know.They say "Donald Trump is not a true conservative because he taxes."There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech very, very soon.It’s all over CNN.Two planes.Weâ€™ve defended other nationâ€™s borders while refusing to defend our own.And I see it last night again.The worldâ€™s largest company, Apple, announced plans to bring $245 billion in overseas profits home to America.And they did a very thorough investigation.We’re going to approve it but I want 10%, 15%.Woman:
No, sir.I think it was like 50,000 or 60,000 more than they’ve ever had before.We’re going to make ourselves rich again.And people will come into the country legally.First of all, we have a president who told them a date.And I said this.If I was president, I’d say, "Congratulations.None.Okay, Iâ€™ll criticize judges.It’s important to understand what America First means.And we appreciate it.You look at women â€” 65 years.And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.What it has to be is when somebody’s on line and they say it’s going to be a seven day wait, that person is going to walk over to across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of.And these are people who come over to the country and they’re DREAMERs.But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps.Silent majority?Here’s the thing.Iâ€™m just saying, at some point, I think theyâ€™re going to have to come back.You, I remember more than anybody.I was the same thing.So when I came down — when I came down on the escalator, we came down.I think I’m a nice person.The world is blowing up, the migration in Syria — they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to Syria, and the whole world’s talking about it.This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.I just saw him.And, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it.LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS.And weâ€™re going to be working â€” weâ€™re discussing that situation exactly right now.She was totally radicalized.It turned out to be a lot of money, not a little money.We will make America safe again.We’re going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen.All right?Join me in believing in this better and brighter future.We as a country are being ripped off.The establishment’s got a problem, you know.I like China.Or related in some â€” not too many.We will win on health care.And we’re going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors.I use many stats.They say, "He hasn’t cracked 50%."25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part – think of that – as part of the global jihad.You know, it’s amazing to watch it.What do you say â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  You donâ€™t really believe that stat, do you?Q    Please explain â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Why â€” did I say that?It doesn’t mean anything.Now, most of the money went out quite a while ago.In fact, I get criticized all the time.I would bet you we could save 20% of our budget.It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business.The borders will remain open.So I don’t really see one or two.Weâ€™ve been touring for quite a while, and Iâ€™ll tell you what â€” 29?Okay?The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.But weâ€™ve done â€” weâ€™re saving, by the way â€” just for the taxpayer, weâ€™re saving a fortune.Q    Mr. President, are you putting what youâ€™re calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane?Interestingly, they said "He’ll never run.Who has read The Art of the Deal?I’m doing some shows tomorrow.Very bad, evil people....They write me a letter.It’s hurt him."We’re going to leave on such and such a date."And I took some heat and I always explained that.We would have gotten them back.And thatâ€™s all theyâ€™re doing, is delaying.They don’t want her to testify because she’s a disaster.Unbroken.Because weâ€™re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal.We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion.And weâ€™re actually I think probably leading â€” based on everything weâ€™re seeing â€” and weâ€™ve spent practically nothing.I’ve had these guys that I’m on the stage with go you don’t really mean Mexico is going to pay for the wall.If I don’t win, I will consider this" — and I mean this — "a total and complete waste of time."So I have a great relationship with the Hispanics.And the line looked like it was, you know, long.The level of genius — they fully understand.These are bad jobs.And she actually said "Some of them when they hear your name it looks like they’re a boiler waiting to explode."Let me tell you about the travel ban.We should have the Gulf states — Saudi Arabia and these states they are not spending.She served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT LOVE OUR COUNTRY.The tariffs are hurting China very badly.They talk about fantasy football.Q    Yes or no, are you going to â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Canada will come along.And I built a great company and it’s a tremendous number.And weâ€™re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.But then I’m good at that stuff, you know?But they say the people are with – we have the most loyal people by far.And they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, "go home."Now, nobody ever reports that, but thatâ€™s why we did it quickly.So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.So remember that.I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things â€” port of entries, lots of different things.Why aren’t we taking that oil back?I said, I had 20,000 people.In Iowa.You know, we talk about how well we’re doing.Weâ€™re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.I think Marco is highly overrated.The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure.Why is it, Mr. President, that you always seem to side with the accused and not the accuser?Right?THE PRESIDENT:  Iâ€™m not putting anybody on a moral plane.If I do well, this and that.I will fight for you with every breath in my body â€“ and I will never, ever let you down.But it would make us highly competitive.They will love going to their job.And I guess we’re live on CNN, we’re live on so many different things.Everybody knew that.Morning Joe held it up and he said, "Wow, those are great numbers."Look, I’m not a fan of Mitt Romney.The people of this country are absolutely amazing.So, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals.Like a lot of money on jets.What was it like 18 months later?Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false.And this wasn’t a setup.Go ahead.There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.Who knows?I can always be convinced.You pay your taxes, follow our laws, support your communities, raise your children, love your country, and send your bravest to fight in our wars.It’s lying.And I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not – if I were him, I’d spend money on positive ads about himself.They used it on Romney.What could possibly be more bipartisan than allowing families to keep more of what they earn and creating an environment for real job and wage growth in the country that we love so much?You suggested that the Chinese â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I did.We're going to bring them back ...






 And I know how to do it.Now, I know you people arenâ€™t skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee.You know, this world of politics – "Mr. Trump, you said -" don’t forget I’m the one that said take the oil.I love you.There will be consequences for those companies.We’ve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%.I have been in business a long time.You canâ€™t buy bread.And actually I think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which was interesting but I wasn’t surprised.And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.I was the slowest with the trigger.Here’s what I have to say about Iowa.(Applause.)The worst.I said, "Is he intelligent?"We have great law enforcement officials.…A lot of European countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration.Does anybody have a final â€”

Q    I have an infrastructure question.THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY.So, we put out a statement today.They have been magnificent.But Mr. Bannon came on very late.Young.SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS, BUT THE SUPER-DELEGATES, THAT WAS WORSE THAN WHAT HAPPENED WITH US.Why?And they were having a lot of difficulties.They’re not coming down because it’s too dangerous.When I did "The Art of the Deal", I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional.WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH.But it’s so bad, all the people that they didn’t think were signing up are signing up.I really have just a great feeling about it.She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot.General Kelly â€” you know, they used to put political people â€” I refuse to say political hacks because I would not say that.Sit down.He was saying the nicest things about me.YOU LOOK AT AREAS EVEN FROM HERE, BUT YOU LOOK AT PLACES, YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE NEW ENGLAND AND NEW YORK STATE AND PENNSYLVANIA, GREAT STATE -- WE'RE LEADING IN PENNSYLVANIA BY THE WAY.I donâ€™t mind bad stories.You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he’ll do well.But weâ€™re going to take care of that, too.No rockets.They’ve never seen what’s happening right now.So I understand it because Iâ€™m there.So we have to bring our country back and so many different things.We’re going to get rid of Common Core.Last week in California, a 66-year-old veteran – a female, a veteran, 66 – got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed.I love that.After we repeal and replace Obamacare, our Republican majority will pass massive, historic tax reform â€” the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and potentially even bigger.You know, think about it.They saw â€” what is America doing?It’s got to be fair stuff, folks.The election, it came out really well.Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO.PERSIANS, GREAT NEGOTIATORS.And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.Iâ€™ve been briefed.One company said, sir, weâ€™re building a big plant â€” thereâ€™s nothing we can do to stop it.The strategy of our economic rivals has worked.They are building a bridge on every corner.So, I said that, since my election, our economy has become the hottest in the world.And secondly â€”

THE PRESIDENT: I think they donâ€™t believe it.We have 46 million people and they’re getting food stamps.They would have had everything they wanted.For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more.I didnâ€™t come along and divide this country.Like all nations represented at this great forum, America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper, and every child can grow up free from violence, poverty, and fear.But I want to do â€” so I may delay that.If anybody saw that report.Not all false.And who else won on The Apprentice?Now they call it the Autumn of Trump.This is a person who I’ve known for a long time, who I’ve respected for so long.That’s why you don’t want to give me money, okay?Weâ€™ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves.All talk, no action politicians.I may never even see it.They want to take these migrants — the migrants, you know, and I feel terrible about the migration, caused by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.Q And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about whatâ€™s happening at the border â€” calling it an â€œinvasion,â€ talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on â€” and yet thereâ€™s a lot of reporting out there, thereâ€™s a lot of crime data out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s because of us.I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson.We won’t be losing anything other than we’ll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be.We don’t make good deals anymore.Weâ€™ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote womenâ€™s business leaders and entrepreneurs.They really get it.Go out and vote tomorrow.Second to none.But when I raise almost $6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in.Not like over the last – right?No, they’re going to make a lot of money.President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy.But they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our money.Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville?They’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.How are we doing?Did you ever see what they do now?Every time I turn on an add, I see an ad about Trump.Q    And he called on it again, linking â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Senator McCain?But I hear where they don’t want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which I really like better than going bing, bing, bing —






— and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you — it’s stuck in your hair and you say oh my God, I’ve got to take a shower again.If I win, I have a good chance of winning.BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP OUR MAJORITY.I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses.Pay down our debt.I’ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana, and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs – they literally these jobs have virtually disappeared.You know, he comes in with his big motorcycle jacket and big Harley.And if we elected, we know that.And we’re winning by almost 300 delegates.This is a very big moment for our country because you have a man who is very outstanding, but heâ€™s got very strong charges against him â€” probably charges that nobody is going to be able be â€” to prove.And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur.I want you to go.â€  And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job two months ago.Such an honor.If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.They gave Obama everything.Real news.These are a few that weâ€™re naming.And that’s what’s happening.We’re not going to be where China made last year trade deficits $505 billion.I’ve had the debates.Are you not running?I think.We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security.You have a child, a young child, at stake.Whatever that means.It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn’t seen for decades.When you think – and just one thing before I introduce our incredible person, our incredible guest.She’s so smart.But my preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up.It’s possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he’s going to supersede.But I’ll tell you what, she shouldn’t be allowed to run.Nobody else is going to be able to do that.I have the best courses in the world, so I’d say, you what, if he wants to — I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.I havenâ€™t spoken to her in way over a year.We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.Just remember this: I’m going to be your champion.We’re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.They’re going to have the richest oil — if you go to Iraq, take a look.It’s really – this is the press.But you have to know the facts.Always take the oil!USA!I ALWAYS SAY WHEN I WAS GOING, WHEN I WAS YOUNG GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL AND GOING TO COLLEGE AND BEFORE THAT WE NEVER LOST.We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.Iâ€™m not finished, fake news.And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and weâ€™ll do some questions â€” unless you have no questions.THE PRESIDENT: No, itâ€™s not good, but they happened.And NBC, I made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal, far more than I would have ever gotten — I mean, I made an unbelievable deal — far more than I ever would have gotten if I said I think I’m going to sell it if times were normal, right?THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.And you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you’re going to make a deal.And we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy…
Shall I read you the statement?Anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us.Not going to happen.She’s very smart.No, you’re going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner.Carl Icahn, one of the great businessmen, and others have endorsed me.Q    Was it terrorism, that event?It’s such a great company I’ve built.Boeing just had a big order from China.And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish State and it will forever exist as a Jewish State.I want to straighten things out and I want to make America great again.I like it better than Univision.The best way to keep foreign terrorists â€” or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists â€” from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place.But here’s what’s going to happen:


After I’m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I’m called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — I’ll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.In fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no.We’re just having a celebration.But of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one-state, two-state.This guy is a total disaster.And by signing the national emergency â€” something signed many times by other Presidents â€” many, many times.We're trying to do the right thing.So, a friend of mine, so I call him, I say, "You’re actually doing that."Weâ€™re going to deliver.And we wonâ€™t let that happen.The military orders equipment they don’t even want and the stuff they do want they don’t get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, it’s not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we don’t want.That’s so easy.Right.Q    So could you explain what you meant?And weâ€™re really doing â€” we had a great first year â€” so successful in so many different ways.I have as big a heart as anybody.I said, "How does what feel?"You’re right about that.Or there’s something going on.You know what uranium is, right?I don’t want to do it.I mean, they have to give me the name of the group.We had a great conversation.I SAID PEOPLE SHOULD HONOR PLEDGES.What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else.They said "You didn’t ask me."You had a lot of bad people in the other group.Franklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements.(Applause.)Oh, Hillary.But until we do that, weâ€™re out of the agreement.And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, it’s selling like hotcakes.They’d rather leave it over there.We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and they can do lots of things with those paychecks.They’re sent there by Hillary Clinton and they’re picketing that the money wasn’t sent.We love you.SO THEY GO TO THE PLANE GRAVEYARDS IN THE DESERTS.And actually, sheâ€™s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.
