We’d have three people.He’ll probably – he’ll endorse – just so you know.I certainly didnâ€™t win by people listening to you people, thatâ€™s for sure.Right?History will judge you harshly as you proceed with this impeachment charade.Okay?Just concluded, as you know â€” two days ago, signed a deal with South Korea â€” a trade deal.No, I don’t think I feel any pressure.I’m self-funding my campaign.But – I mean, look what’s going on with your premiums.(Laughter.)We have absolutely nothing.In fact, in Florida, I own Doral and in Florida we had the tournament there two weeks.These are the pastors.I would have said, "I want them back; you don’t understand me.Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that’s it.They never said, "Hey boss, we’re closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight."We tell them.Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz â€”- good lawyer â€” just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.It was called desertion.So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again.We see friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger.And weâ€™re going change it around fast.The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.AND THEY GET FIVE OF THE MOST VICIOUS KILLERS THAT THEY HAVE, THAT THEY'VE BEEN AFTER FOR NINE YEARS TO GET THEM OUT AND THEY BRING THEM AND THEY ARE BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD TRYING TO KILL EVERYBODY, INCLUDING US.He moved them right across the border and they came back and they moved them again and they came back.I’m going on vacation", believe me, it doesn’t get much worse than that.THE PRESIDENT:  They donâ€™t.We may never get it there.Hillary is controlled by her money.Why would you tell people that we’re sending them in?WE'VE BEEN ON THE COVER -- WE'VE BEEN ON THE COVER OF "TIME" MAGAZINE, SO MUCH THAT IT BECOMES ROUTINE.We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.And the stupid trade deal that we’re making doesn’t even cover it.They’re wonderful people.I can pick five other people.This is not acceptable in our society.They gave me that and I love it.That stuff is — those deals are no good.So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.He’s going to have nothing.We had 35,000 people the other day in Alabama.Really good.I didn’t know anything about the debates.We have wounded warriors all over the place.I’m looking at all these people.Okay?The money has all been sent.It’s like Japan.You know this is supposed to be...for like a record.And I’m on the front page a lot on the New York Times, and to be on the front page of the New York Times is a big deal.It’s going to open just in time – and by the way, listen to this one.I got credit.And frankly in a way it’s worse because Cruz is establishment and yet he’s got no relationship with the establishment.USA!I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney â€” (applause) â€” and all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today.Iâ€™d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs.But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy â€” making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.You know, I always tell – I used to say this to politicians that run that’d be friends of mine, I’d say, "Pretend you’re a little bit behind.At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer.We’re going to bring our jobs back from South America.One agency alone can stall a project for many, many years, and even decades.I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother.They’re not sending you (pointing to the audience).Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours?Go home.Atlantic City.Let ISIS be one; let me be two, because I want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year.But I’ll be out there; we’ll be out voting.So they put up a sign.You know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right?Come over here.And it only makes common sense.And by the way, once was a fraudulent ad because they said, "If Cruz and Kasich got together and you added the delegates" – and they showed the delegates.Thank you.And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.Now, I guarantee you one thing.He was young.And many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate.And you know, a lot of the press hasn’t been very fair.THE PRESIDENT:  Itâ€™s a very big â€” itâ€™s also â€” youâ€™re right.I CAN TELL YOU.In the last six months, since I took off the horrible, horrible Iran nuclear deal, as they called it â€” one of the dumbest deals ever made.I should have."like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have.My tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it’s gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups.I should get credit for vision.And they had provisions in the agreement, and they would take it out because certain politicians didnâ€™t want to have them in there.Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.Truck drivers hauled made-in-America goods along this vital artery of commerce.Later this year she will get her masterâ€™s degree in social work.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.It’s going to be your turn.We have 28,000 soldiers on the line.It's true.(Applause.)Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration.Like 5,000.Nothing changes.It is a big problem.Weâ€™ve just had a great set of briefings upstairs on our infrastructure agenda.Helped us; real ally.I WOULD HAVE SAID, LOOK, FELLAS, HERE IS THE STORY.Don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love.We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines â€” (applause) â€” thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.SO HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS.You can’t do it.The guy’s at $59 million and he’s down at the bottom.I was given â€” actually, Iâ€™ve seen that information around.You had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different but Russia is powerful so we could sort of say that’s a balance.We won’t have to use it.I know nothing about that.(Applause.)Everybody wanted it.Now itâ€™s possible Iâ€™ll hear that, and Iâ€™ll say, â€œHey, Iâ€™m changing my mind.â€  That is possible.We’re going to become rich again, we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again.Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that.They don’t even have to give the money back from what I understand.I have been thanked by so many groups – great veterans’ groups.(Applause.)Q    And â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I want to thank you all.The largest guns in the world.He was a monster.But come Nov. 8, weâ€™re going to win Florida, and weâ€™re going to win the White House, and weâ€™re going to make America great again.So here’s what we did.Wow.He’s having a good time.You know, I remember that years ago because I’ve been a very political person on the other side but always very political.So again, I just want to congratulate everybody.THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT AND WE WOULD HAVE LEFT AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK IN TWO WEEKS.That was the first real problem I had with him...
Now, I said a common sense conservative and today I heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said he’s a common sense conservative.People liked that.And I wouldn’t say it against our folks.We owe $19 trillion.Thank you.Beef.So letâ€™s begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the United States military and all of our wonderful veterans.There will be a major tax reduction.I have great respect for China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders.This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history.They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn’t to build a bathroom.What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?He’s at zero.To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States â€” financed through both public and private capital â€” creating millions of new jobs.A Trump Administration will change our failed trade policy – quickly
Here are 7 steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs.But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours.A lot of people said, "Oh, he’ll never file."We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.And it was two of them – two of them.We have to do it.We welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and weâ€™re going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day â€” unlike the way Obamacare was passed.It’s a laughing stock.Somebody who’s going to make the country – why are they knocking it?So, we’re going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again.It’s over.And we charge them nothing.AND WHEN I WAS IN THE DEBATES AND I MENTIONED THIS, PEOPLE WOULD COME UP THAT I WAS DEBATING AGAINST, AND THEY USED TO SAY DONALD, YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO BUILD A WALL, ARE YOU?(Applause.)So thatâ€™s the way it goes.Okay?Don’t be ashamed of your name.But the tone, Jim.A lot of people like him; some people don’t.But, I said, "This is going to be an election that’s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.And Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Administration is working just fine.Real people.And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us.That’s why I really think your question is so great – "I don’t want to hear how you’re going to do it, Mr. Trump.And that’s not going to happen.A.J.THEY GO OUT THERE LOOKING FOR HIM.The car seats.But only the good ones.So I checked many of them.They are going to build that plant – they’re building it, it’s going to be finished soon – they’re going to build that plant, they’re going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you’ll be reading a big front page story all over the place that Boeing is going to leave, right, South Carolina, they’re going to make all their planes in China.You want to put pipelines under our land youâ€™re going to make the pipe in this country.And then it went on from there.I said that they are going to break away.It’s nice.We don’t have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you – do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things?We have to create a safe zone some place in Syria.And you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me.Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.(Off mic.)I have so many friends from Cuba.And the other thing: Chaos.He respectfully gave it.You know, millions of people.I have been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever even thought to be.This is an amazing, amazing night.Then John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didn’t even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America.It’s very sad.Weâ€™re great now.I promise you I would do such a good job.The second statement was made after, with knowledge, with great knowledge.For many, many years, that hasnâ€™t happened.And when I started this journey, and it is a journey, and I do love you people.This mountain actually shifted.We don’t win anymore.We would like to get that."Weâ€™re going to fight this terrible ruling.We’ve got to close the deal.We want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen.I was in first and he was close to last.The only place they donâ€™t want to give as much money â€” $1,375,000,000.We had a good time.The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.Now, I said you have to have a commitment to make it.Ford.But they take our business.I assume that’s not happening.But I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event.NOW I'M LOOKING AT DIFFERENT RATES AND DIFFERENT CRIMES.We would have been down the tubes.What theyâ€™ve done to this family, what theyâ€™ve done to these children â€” these beautiful children of his â€” and what theyâ€™ve done to his wife.You’re going to destabilize the Middle East.He was born in Canada.Theyâ€™re not true.Hey, look at our leadership, it’s got flaws.It could have been a little bit better.Americans.Look at my hands.Q No, itâ€™s not going to be a bad question.The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate United Nations Security Council resolutions.Let’s put them in.Right?How we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe.Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.No, they never said that.He’s so thrilled and so happy.I hate to tell you, itâ€™s not.And Forbes and another group said, "No, no, we don’t know what these companies are."Go ahead.And this is quite a gathering.And then they’d come in, "Sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week."No guns.I promise you.THE PRESIDENT:  One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have for many years, is in the Middle East.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re in support of me because Iâ€™d be all â€” Iâ€™d be in the wilderness without you guys.We’re going to do it, folks.Bring them back.They said that itâ€™s good.Big.…If I didn’t run, I’d probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible.But we’re not being protected whether it’s a budget.And I watch these guys â€” Little Adam Schiff, and all of the guys.And I’m a free trader.They said very strongly, they said, "We are going to want a lot for the prisoners.According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.What?Okay?General Odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember.Thereâ€™s no nothing.Communities thriving with jobs and surging with commerce.And youâ€™re going to go to it, and youâ€™re going to do a phenomenal job.The Gulf States have nothing but money.All you had to do was say, "We want our prisoners back."And the best thing I could do is say – but I can’t destroy a man.THE PRESIDENT:  But Iâ€™ve learned â€” who?Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.And then you go to other countries and you see places like you’ve never seen.You know, Obama always leaves the White House.It was a beautiful thing.So we need help.BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS A SAFE COUNTRY.Sarah was here.We’re going to win.And they’re not bad.It’s been an honor.Those guys – we need law and order.He’s a nice guy.I love it.WE USED TO BE AT THE TOP.But if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, it’s impossible.Go ahead and see.So, she says the solution is to ban guns.When Ford moves to Mexico, I’m going to talk them out of it.Nobody knows the system better than me.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.We’re going to make our economy incredible again.Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details.We have to take care of our vets.Thank you.They’ve agreed for years.That’s with 14 people, 15 people.You don't just ...






 You don't just add them together.He had a bad night, according to CNN, Fox.We don’t know what the hell he was going to do."Your deductibles are going through the roof.I can’t even talk about it.Today, we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent, and itâ€™s way more than that.So weâ€™re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.It’s been a little controversial.Letâ€™s go, Jim.And I like Gov.Yes, please.Right?Well, I understand how the system works maybe better than anybody.We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.And I said, "If I get in, we’re going to stop that problem."Low level guy.I would have won in Ohio but I didn’t want to take a chance leaving my beautiful Florida because I love Florida and I wanted to win that.The president can’t make a deal.The insurance companies are gone and theyâ€™re going to lose the next one pretty soon from what they say.You have problems with the VA also, huh?I go remember he got elected – "I like Ike".Theyâ€™re going to believe what they believe.I’m not going to be quick.33%.It’s not a silent majority.I have very good relationships with the people of New Hampshire.No, no, it’s true.I think Iâ€™ll stop short of that.MR. SCHWAB: â€” who tremendously contributed to the discussions the last (inaudible).We owe $20 trillion.You look at New England.And the jobs we have now are bad jobs.They couldn’t get it done.It’s like extortion.Where is Jerry?That’s the way life works.Right?But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.WELL, THEY ARE CHOPPING OFF HEADS.I don’t know when they took it but it was recent.And you know what else is a disaster?I’m a believer and I believe in the Bible.I may say, I want 10%.They have to do it.All right?But I’ll tell you what, when you look at what we’re doing, we’re not going to have — if we keep going like this, folks, we’re not going to have a country left.Now, this wasn't close.I don’t know if I can make it.Weâ€™re going to work very hard on the inner city.As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, "Yes, she violated section so and so".He loves me.Thank you!Like you don’t buy planes here because if you do, you won’t be able to get them back in.Petraeus was, you know, essentially – look, I don’t want to get into it with the poor guy.They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned â€” theyâ€™re bad people, folks.So it really doesnâ€™t matter from their standpoint.They refused to comply.He just called me and said, "It’s a movement you’ve got going.And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled â€” right, Mike?Theyâ€™re not going to have old equipment much longer.It just went beautifully â€” right through the roof.TPP is a disaster.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes.But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States.We have to be smart.They’ll give us the money.(Laughs.)And I want to thank Ben Carson, whoâ€™s going to be heading up HUD.The worst in 36 years.These are people only believe in jihad.They’re our greatest people.I’ll give you one good example.Did you see the picture last week where they had a little wall this big and they built a ramp for trucks to go over it with trucks?We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television.Its politics.And somebody would say that’s profiling.Isnâ€™t that easier â€” look, if Iâ€™m â€” do you think Hillary does that?Great.It’s very hard.He's very tough.And you know she’s been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it’s Whitewater.And you know what they want so badly?Some people are so surprised that weâ€™re having strong borders.Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.They don’t want her.Boom!You can do so much better in Iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in Washington.Okay?What a bunch of babies.Not me.Who are you with?Because that was a sad case.I’m not going to let Japan rip us off.I mean, the good work with the police.(Laughter.)They come to my office.They didnâ€™t step up, and they should have.We get a dirty, no good traitor.Yeah, itâ€™s a con job.You know, guys like Jeb Bush and Hillary, they hire pollsters.Or if they canâ€™t do it, Iâ€™ll have Sarah Huckabee do it.And you look at crime.Thank you very much.We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.Now, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up.I talked about the border.(Applause.)You’re CNN.Combine them all.Nobody understands it.Fake news, folks.Whoever heard of this?This is your moment.And I said, "$1 million for what?We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help.You’ll have to find out.They came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and they’re Democrats and they’re long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched.So this guy was just getting beaten.They’re bad jobs."And you know really don’t — I’ll tell you who does not like — yeah, we’ll get Ivanka.We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.We must...






... we must as a nation be more unpredictable.I got back our hostages; I never paid them anything.We have a stock market that is so bloated.Where were you?"I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters.(Applause.)Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.And I’ve been there.Weâ€™re going to support the amazing â€” absolutely amazing men and women of law enforcement.Omarosa is actually a very nice person.You lost 70,000 jobs to China.‘But if I hadn’t brought you in by now, heaven’s sake you might have died.’ Now she stroke his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held him tight.(Applause.)A lot.But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report.We have one young lady whose husband â€” please, stand up.Take their â€” letâ€™s see what happens to her.No, did you hear?Over nothing.You know why?Thank you.And it’s been an amazing time.He would be the best president ...






 And representing some very, very wonderful children, Ivanka.So I want to thank everybody for being here.So if you donâ€™t mind, I would ask â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  I wouldnâ€™t mind that at all.First of all, I am a great Christian and I am.First of all, I have to tell you.We don’t have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their job.I said, "They did?"Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.These people are so stupid."There's nothing wrong with that, right?Mr. President, yesterday at the speech at the U.N., you spoke about how Venezuelaâ€™s problem was because of Cuba and the Castros â€” how they went in there and they brought socialism and communism to Venezuela, and now to Nicaragua as well.You know what I want to do?I think itâ€™s going to be a very, very important day in the history of our country.Well, I got it for two reasons.They all tried.Japan – they send their cars by the millions.Bob Lighthizer has done a great job of negotiating, as they have.Our prisoners – I want them back.USA!THANK YOU.AND WE CREATED ISIS.And have you talked about that with him?Weâ€™ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.I think it’s bothersome because I love the vets and I’ve worked hard for the vets.He said, â€œDonald.And think of the new inventions that will lift up the sights of our nation.Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today.People are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago.People say "What’s going on?It’s time.These aren’t silent people anymore.There’s anger.Right?You know what you’re saying?Nobody believes you’re running.AUDIENCE:  USA!You know, you’re talking about 10, 11, 12 years that people have wanted to bring the money back into the country.And Hope and our whole squad.We go to New Hampshire, then we go to the finals (ph), so three weeks.That’s why he’s out of the race because he couldn’t figure it out.This is a much different – this is a normal voting process.Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.But we’re going to have security.Our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security.This is something everybody agrees – the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things – taxes paid.And you just — I actually — I shouldn’t do it.America will be independent once more.And General Mattis has been great â€” you see whatâ€™s going on.Now, in all fairness, because of the agreement that’s about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place.Very good relationship that we have.We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America â€” the America we love.No, but I’d love to finish first.Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, I don’t care.But the Asians love me and I love them.Are we babies?Okay?Pretty good.The FBI has great and honorable people, but the leadership was inept and corrupt.They want better lives, not more petty attacks from failed and totally discredited politicians like crooked Hillary Clinton.It’s probably the first women he’s ever had.Now, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, thatâ€™s okay with me.They're going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country.Those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe, and maybe someday hit even the United States.Yeah.Our vets are being treated worse than illegal immigrants.But one of the things – "Never use the term ‘anchor baby’."The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together.So for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incoming…In fact that was my first two weeks.(Laughter and applause.)I have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for President.They’re like gamblers.I don’t want them in our jails.He’s doing a tremendous job.We need somebody who’s strong.They don’t have any Christmas displays.Done by very, very bad people.THE PRESIDENT: He wanted it.But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.At least, because we don’t even know who’s coming in.But he doesn’t treat me right.And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.– I said jokingly "How long did it take them to do these massive islands they’re building right out of the sea?For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment.And I said, I hope they don’t call this guy.But I’m doing something – nobody is giving up what I’m giving.As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before.You probably saw that.EXCEPT I THINK ACTUALLY IT WILL BE WORSE.Germany!And Adam, who’s a great guy – I guess a lot of you folks saw that – but I’m watching...we have television screens all over.I hope.I sell millions of millions of condos to people from China.They want to do it -- they don't want bureaucrats in Washington telling them how to educate their children.I will tell you.Itâ€™s time that Washington heard your voice â€” and believe me, on November 8th, they heard your voice.(Applause.)Because a lot of people said, "He’ll never run.But I only like polls that treat me well.You look at all of the things that are bad--  I'll give you an example."Mr. Trump’s tone is not nice."In recent years, I’ve been struggling with an incurable illness and I’m on home care now.Thatâ€™s what he does.Take me in for heaven’s sake.And I don’t mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better.They don’t have those tools now.You’re not taking a renewal."We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.I mean, our country is like a third world country.We are going to have fantastic trade deals.The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we’re losing $400 billion a year.And I called him.You’re moving to Mexico.I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.And they know itâ€™s a big, fat con job.And when I was running in Florida, I said "How is it possible to win?"And when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that.The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated.I watched New Yorkers dying.I’m really good at it, folks.(Applause.)Remember this, I wasnâ€™t thrilled, but the lawyers all said, letâ€™s tailor it.Itâ€™s been something thatâ€™s really been very special.We shouldn’t be saying it.Thank you very much.Now, just so you understand, Kasich is running also.Such an easy job heâ€™s got.Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii â€” part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court â€” and I have to be nice; otherwise Iâ€™ll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.But just remember, they’re not so stupid like you think.Those statements aren’t really meant for me – it’s not meant for a guy like me.It was so cold.But his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I’ve heard about it for years.These aren’t good jobs.YOU DON'T NEED THAT.Everybody knows that.Do you understand it’s reverse psychology.That’s the wrong number.And all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger.Balance it out, fellows.I don’t want to wait for your freaking Applause.Weâ€™re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.He gave the world his apology tour.So we should have kept the oil.How many people?Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history.Weâ€™re going to have a great eight years together.SO HERE IS THETORY, FOLKS.And by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they’re going to come into this country, but they’re going to come in legally, OK?So I could have you chosen for a position.So I won’t do this a lot.HOW IS YOUR GOVERNOR DOING, BY THE WAY?He wasnâ€™t greeted by the top officials."Well, let us go check, Mr. President, we’ll check."So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up.So there’s something and it’s so important.And then he came to me the next year…but Trace came to me and he goes – you know, at certain awards show, I won’t mention the name – but he said "Last year, I couldn’t get into the show and this year I’m hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you."They’re controlled fully — they’re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.They will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power.The other night in Iowa, I told that, and I said, we have so many young people and the place erupted.You know, like 11 million.Is it terrorism?But if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the Democrats that he doesn’t have the right to be president.Everything was fine.One hundred years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again.So I just want you to know that.I thought it was terrific.And now if they want to dump, thatâ€™s okay, but theyâ€™ve got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump.And our leaders aren’t smart enough to stop it, okay?Iran is taking over Iraq, and they’re taking it over big league.I’m special.I assume it’s a typo but maybe not.He deserted.They’re fed up with stupid leaders.Thatâ€™s not great.I’m going to win.They have no papers.So I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect.And I think he went back tot he beginning, but let’s say second World War.I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare.Okay?So, I started and I talked about the border.And I have to tell you legal – you come in and we’re going to have a good time and you’re going to be there and you’re going to do great – and visas – maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we’ll do something, we’re not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form.You apparently have so little respect for the American People that you expect them to believe that you are approaching this impeachment somberly, reservedly, and reluctantly.I could sit in a room — or the Oval Office — for a period of, literally, a half hour and I really believe I could get everybody — every single — you know, it’s one thing they don’t agree on health care or they don’t agree on common core or they don’t agree on other things and they’ll fight.But I see the ads on foreign policy.THE PRESIDENT: Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.And today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us.We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.You know, I’ve been here for a long time.And he’s not somebody that just do it.Don’t do that."But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.All of these things – we’re going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something that’s much better and much less expensive....Very sad but I think it’s going to be really a story of hope and something that is really great is going to happen out of that.THANK YOU.Q    So how can a guy who does that be your friend?We get nothing.But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I’m now leading Hillary Clinton.But I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat.They canâ€™t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where thereâ€™s no barrier, and they come into the United States.Can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time?I said to John Deere, "I want an endorsement."WE PRAY FOR THEIR LOVED ONES.And can you tell us how youâ€™re feeling about your chief strategist, Stephen Bannon?Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?And again, itâ€™s the same old story.Sadly, Iâ€™d probably do the same thing to them, okay?President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.PAGE AFTER PAGE OF THE LIES -- PAGE AFTER PAGE OF THE LIES.We didn’t get our prisoners back.We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.But when you think about the kind of numbers youâ€™re talking about â€” so you have $700 billion, $716 billion â€” when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall â€” which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.And weâ€™ve even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.And I always tell the story.Are you ready for this?I said, â€œYou have to do me a favor.I thought it was terrible.Yes, I think that Iâ€™ve already â€”

Q Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?We don’t have money.And, by the way, if I might add, including the womenâ€™s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.But we are run by incompetent people.it won’t happen.People were shocked, Trump got it.But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.They’re tough cookies.He arrested three people; everyone else scattered.It has no place in America.I don’t know what’s going to happen.So maybe all of it but I doubt it.The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.And one other thing happened.Now, I would have done it differently.And I wanted to go up and I wanted to hug that television set.But if I get the number of delegates, there’s not a thing they can do.If you have the right messenger…






I’m really focused on one very big election, one very important election, and there are some pretty good elections.That didnâ€™t work.While protecting the environment, we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels, and highways.You’re going to be so proud of this country again.He likes me.Youâ€™ve raised doubts about these accusers.People that put the money in are dealing with the candidates.So I’m not taking money from anybody.He laughed.I’ve never done this before.24 days.I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.He can get nothing done.We need like every character.…Then I announced.There wonâ€™t be intellectual property theft.You know, and you have that kind of a Sheriff here.I met him over a year ago.(Laughter.)Some of them I really like.Thank you all for doing a really incredible and creative job on what weâ€™re going to be discussing today, which is infrastructure.SPEECH 15: President Trump Press Conference - Feb. 16, 2017

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.Theyâ€™re going to take down some more.WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE WALL -- OH, THAT WALL IS GOING TO BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS A WALL COULD BE.Every birthday since she was four, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Judeâ€™s Childrenâ€™s Hospital.I could do the wall over a longer period of time.BUT WE DIDN'T KEEP THE OIL.And the freeing of political prisoners.Everybody was bidding.Now, maybe we won’t.Thank you, Sheriff.It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters.The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.We can’t stand the guy any more."I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve noticed.Okay?I said, â€œWow.That’s what we got.They can’t find jobs.They’re sleaze.You know, Obama signed an executive order where everybody just come in.Itâ€™s gone.Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism.There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism.He’s a disaster.Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.Why does that matter so much?â€  They said, â€œIt just is impossible to make peace in the Middle East unless you have between the Israelisâ€¦â€

So, I heard that from one â€” the King of Saudi Arabia, who is a great guy â€” King Salman.VARIOUS ANCHORS, SOME OF WHOM TRULY DISLIKE DONALD TRUMP HAVE SAID WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US -- TO US, I'M THE MESSENGER, YOU'RE THE IMPORTANT ONES IN THIS WHOLE THING, BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO US IS ONE OF THE GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENONS THEY'VE EVER SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.So we will get that straightened out.That’s a problem.Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes.Yeah, go ahead, Jim.RICHARD PETTY.Maybe more.Be very careful.I’ve done well in the debates.Yes.They want to do their job properly.But millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood.So we give them $150 billion and they’re not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products.You couldn’t turn on in Florida where I was you couldn’t turn on the television without seeing Trump commercials.It lasted for two hours.I know it’s a record for the room.I don’t want to tell all.On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or tenth generation.I don’t know if they’ve even announced Illinois yet but we’re leading by a lot so I think they’re going to announce it.And now I’m in politics so I have to see people I wouldn’t normally...The Boston bombers came here through political asylum.I have some people that I know very well and they’ve had a job for 20 years at the same place.But I have another one, Ford.I could even save more.But I want to get the automobile industry to build factories here.THEY WERE KILLED.And you’d say to yourself, "People give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million.But I built a great company.You got to use.And you think I’m going to change?I threw it into a chapter.We’re leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers.Don’t worry about it.SOON GOING TO $21 TRILLION.Together, Republicans will lead America into our unbelievable future.Itâ€™s all a big lie.They didn’t even respond.So now – maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research – so many of this – there’s so many good – Alzheimer’s – you know, there’s so many things going on.You know.You know what he did?We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force, purpose and determination.And Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed me.We have people that aren’t working.We are removing these gang members by the thousands.And he was like depressed.And we want to stand alongside of them.They’re all over the place.(Applause.)Florida was so amazing.Now, I said it for economic reasons."But you’d go to New Hampshire.And some of the more fair reporters — about 30 percent of them — said he was right.It's a scandal.And some of the states will take over their healthcare.Because it’s — it’s inconceivable.As an example, education.Itâ€™s this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won â€” some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room â€” instead of being up almost 50 percent â€” the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent â€” rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.They respect what Iâ€™ve done.Today, Iâ€™m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.We’re bringing them back from Mexico.That’s good.One second, right?I have the smartest people in this country lined up.I want to congratulation Ted on the winning of Texas.[Audience response inaudible]
Okay, because she talked about falling to – now after, I must tell you, her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground.Well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his – you know, he certainly lives above his means.We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it.You wonder why we get the crowds, you wonder why we get this tremendous support, you wonder why I’ve gotten more votes than any Republican in any primary in the history of the Republican Party?Yes.But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them.You know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago.TRUMP: Thank you.How do you do that?AND I HATE SAYING THAT.But I want to steer it to them when I can.You remember?But they didn’t have tractors.This isn’t a caucusing process.And if they bring it back, they’ll be using it to invest in our country.And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy â€” and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.You know one of the reasons they didn’t build the wall?The people are really smart.China – think of this – China we owe $1.4 trillion to.So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer.Thank you very much.I tell you that.We’re beating the governor.And last night in Kentucky, we had a tremendous crowd â€” 25,000 people, more â€” and a similar crowd in Tennessee, by the way â€” packed, with thousands of people outside.Your deductible is so high.I mean, even if you’re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russia’s a problem, China’s a problem.And he waits.So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1.4 trillion.Iâ€™m not happy about that, because I know itâ€™s going to be a question.Let’s face it.When Nabisco moves its plant from Chicago to Mexico, I’m going to talk them out of it.I see him on the different shows.These are monster, monster economies.They used to call it the quiet majority.I donâ€™t like whatâ€™s happening in Cuba.Youâ€™re never going to be able to use it.Theyâ€™re going to love waking up in the morning, going to work.We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they donâ€™t have the right equipment.(Applause.)Right?I’m more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of Obamacare and coming up with something much, much better, and certainly, getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you’re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education.Honestly, if I didn’t believe this, I couldn’t say it.Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.My people said, "No, this is the biggest one.But he was fighting and I gave him a lot of money and he came up, you know, a year ago or so and he gave me a plaque.Everybody was taking advantage of us.It is a loss.And the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it, not to give money to different things because it’s a lot easier actually that way.Q    George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.I always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning.The wall is peanuts.It’s a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow.Big consequences.And you know what?So there’s this poll that comes out.But when I put, let’s say, Carl Icahn and I’ll say "Carl, do me a favor.Now, we have a very important election coming up.Can you believe it?Thank you, everybody.Right?(Applause.)It’s one of those things.And now it's happening more and more.(Laughter.)What?So in one sense I like it, but basically Iâ€™m a low-interest-rate person.Both everybody is going to like us more.I love people.Thank you.Iâ€™ve condemned many different groups.But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Meganâ€™s life, from reaching those in need.It was poorly delivered.THANK YOU.Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.They said "it's a movement."Boy, he’s taking a lot of abuse.Go home to mom.THE PRESIDENT:  The guy looks totally like stunned that I â€” have you ever been picked before for a question?Now, you think about that.Hopefully all of the people in this room.Don’t we agree?So I would approve it.Obamacare.Q    Weâ€™re kind of, uh â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  And then weâ€™ll call it quits.He makes that deal, Israel maybe won’t exist very long.And you will never ever use them.People are scared.No, I used to think they couldn’t move.We’re gonna be there very soon.And we conceded on every single.Then Obama got out the wrong way.I don’t like dishonesty.It’s being chipped and chipped.But he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall.ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.And we’re keeping it open.I was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn’t vet them quickly.I didnâ€™t either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it.And he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what?You’re not supposed to run."I donâ€™t think itâ€™s ever been â€” I just donâ€™t want to be second-guessed.Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.Thatâ€™s considered a cool auditorium.It’s beautiful.They drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars – millions of cars – and we sell them beef.Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie.Some of it didn’t come through.(Laughter.)But that is the past.But more importantly, he choked.They spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide – listen to this one – 55,000 negative ads on me.Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last weekâ€™s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.Take a look at the deal he’s making with Iran.We need lots of energy.All to charity.The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.They have to pay.First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.Remember?THE PRESIDENT:  I wonder how you do â€” you know, all my life, Iâ€™ve had very few stories â€” but Iâ€™ve had some on the front page of the New York Times.The whole – the world blew up around her.I havenâ€™t paid them 10 cents.And we’re paying interests on them and we owe them money.Let me do it.Somebody could come and say, â€œThirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me.Why didnâ€™t she bring it right at the beginning?I don’t think so.We’re importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president.That’s what I am.They have got to spend.They wanted me to end up in a boxing match.There is none.What a great â€” where is she?But you know what?YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN BERNARDINO.But they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldn’t go 15 feet.I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me.11%.But to flip coins, they say "Okay, you’re going to get this district.(Applause.)And we have people that are controlled by special interests.But suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country?I don’t want them in our country.But I think I will probably be able – what my history – you know, I took some heat because I get along with Democrats, I get along with liberals, I get along with conservatives, I get along with Republicans.People massively injured, still in the hospital.Do you know why?When our soldiers aren’t being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today.And I just want to say we’re going to go forward and we’re going to win.If it’s windy, if it’s hot – everything is extreme.But what theyâ€™ve done here is a disgrace.Specific date to the day.I talk about Second Amendment.Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.And the things they say â€” and Iâ€™ve known her for a long time â€” the things they say are so unfair.We have an amazing thing happening, it’s just...






 Look, that’s their way of marginalizing, not even me, they are marginalizing you.AND WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM, AS BAD AS THESE TWO SITUATIONS WERE, AND I PERSONALLY THINK THEY WERE, THEY WERE BAD.Sixty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six now live in poverty.They’re sending us not the right people.We’re simplifying.I’m a conservative person....But I think the political press...I think the political press – I see the stories and I see the way they’re attached.Thank you all for being here.But those three guys, they’re great and they’re just fantastic people.I swear to you I won’t do anything."So they're very tired of it.I’d like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and California.(Applause.)WE HAVE NO CHOICE.I heard one of my commentators this morning, said, "you know, I’ve been watching this stuff for 50 years and I’ve never seen anything like what has happened with Trump.Well, the Chairman asked if he could come up.(Applause.)We’re going to flip a coin."We want the world to be — we want to bring peace to the world.Carried interest.We — "build a wall" is right.So he’s an insider but it’s almost like the man on the street because he can’t get anything done.They said trump is a great speaker.And just for the record, we donâ€™t hate you, I donâ€™t hate you.Nobody’s going to mess with us.Lieutenant Governor Parson.Together, We will make America strong again.See, Obama never read the Art of the Deal.Q    (Inaudible.)Each year the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East.Very simple.Can they go three hours?What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who donâ€™t believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions.I came out.THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY THAT DEALS WITH US ARE FAR SHARPER AND FAR BETTER.And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.Nobody talks about it.Honestly, Iowa is so important to me.I mean, I know cities.But we can only get there together.And yes — and they’re looking forward to it.THE PRESIDENT:  And the other thing â€” very important â€” I believe wages will start going up.Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, they’re going to Ireland.Isn’t it crazy?They died.And you know what?And I think you do a very good job.But it’s interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list, they’re at 1%, 2%, you know, in terms of what happened – what just happened – they’re at 1%, they’re at 2%, they’re 3%.Itâ€™s been festering for many, many years.Obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well.I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying, â€œItâ€™s too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but Iâ€™m going to choose you, number two.You had Camp David in 2000, where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous.But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is.And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, "Oh wow, we can get away with this and it’s going to make it impossible."And we’re going to pay for that and it’s going to cost less money – it’s going to cost less money than the system we have now – and you’re going to end up getting much better care.What Iâ€™m saying is this:  You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs â€” and it was vicious and it was horrible.I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint.They can’t make a deal because they have no leader.Doctors are quitting the business.I SAID ALL RIGHT.Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.She is a truly wonderful woman, of the job she’s done in Florida is incredible.Well, thank you.I mean, there are a lot of them.Q Mr. President, thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, fair question.But we’ve got to go back.I said, "Let me ask you.Theyâ€™re screaming and I saw that.You see whatâ€™s happening.I want to make our country great again.He has done some job.USA!Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don’t talk about him.How else am I going to raise the money?You’re going to see some real good things happen.We’ve got about a 20-point lead.It’s obsolete.Because if I don’t win, to me, I will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time."Number one, we have the smartest.We’re going to rebuild the military.I don’t think it’s appropriate.The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever.Get rid of the fraud.I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLE.There is none.We’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.Highly overrated.They don’t know what they’re doing.Nothing’s gonna get done.Good company.They use it all the time.I’ve been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans activist.Like we did this afternoon at the hangar.And I looked out the window.I’m number one by a lot and I spent no money.And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe.What is going on?And high-quality manufacturing jobs lifted up communities, gave Americans a paycheck that could support a family.And then you look at — I was there and you had lines that went a mile long.Like a rocket ship.They conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later, OK?But I just want to thank the President, because heâ€™s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.They just – they run, they win, they lose, who knows?Now, you look like you’re doing pretty well in all fairness.This is the United States Senate.I knew it from the other side.Weâ€™re talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people.Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day....Look, when this started...I said if we could raise $1 million that would be good.You go to China.I said, "Fellas, you’re going to have Iran take over the Middle East and that’s what’s happening."We’re not eating oreos anymore, right?And he ran for Congress.TODAY THEY ARE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT NOTHING.But if they don’t win, we’re going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe Supreme Court judges.Other people are going to die.He mentions it but I don’t think he’s going to be capable of doing anything about it.Thank you so much.I mean, you’re going to win."They’ve been working so hard.They like Christmas.(Applause.)We want to help them.You know, I used the word before.And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, â€œThirty-five years ago, you met someâ€¦â€ â€” and you might know â€” you might not know whatâ€™s going on.Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.And with NATO when they don’t pay, you know, I said – I was asked a question by Wolf Blitzer, a very fair question about NATO.You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake.Some are going to Nevada.I wouldn’t leave the White House.Right?Mitt Romney lost an election he should have won.But we had the best plan.They say the audience is old.So weâ€™re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you.I’m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that’s in big trouble.(Applause.)I don’t believe it.I made speeches for him.I said how many Christians are there?Theyâ€™re great people.I said, "How can I hit him?Q    Thank you, Mr. President.When I look at parents and I see local parents in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, I went to a school and I saw the parents, they love their children.It’s been really amazing.And God bless America.Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.I mean people were writing, "How are Mr. Trump’s hands?"For two weeks.And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal thatâ€™s fair.Everybody – even my enemies – said "Trump is going to win."A very special man and president.And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.She wants to take away American’s guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.You know, it can be solved.But I will anyways, so I guess it doesnâ€™t matter.We have the greatest people on earth.(Applause.)I hear only – I just hear terrible.‘You’re so beautiful,’ she cried.Here tonight is Debra Bissell.Q On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?How many people are from Cuba here?And now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three.And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.We have the highest employment numbers weâ€™ve ever had in the history of our country.Do you understand?Tiffany, Eric, Lara and Melania.Because of this and other reasons, like weak borders, America remains stuck in the past.And he’d come over to your house, check you out, fine.They’re building military fortresses in the South China Sea.Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism.So, 2,000 years ago in China – we always get back to China – 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China – oh, we’d like to have a wall.I said, "yes.Please â€”

Q    About Iran, Mr. President.Oh, stay up.The House bill ends the Obamacare nightmare and gives healthcare decisions back to the states â€” and back to the American people.We’re going to repeal it.We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.But I could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made – I didn’t want to do that.(Applause.)You see it with Jamiel.They’re building in the South China Seas a massive military fort.Please.We’ve been losing all the time.She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.Like bigger than anything you’ve seen.GOOD?(Applause.)I love it.So that’s not so bad either.It also holds agencies accountable if they fail to streamline their review process.You heard about that.And these are big plants â€” $750 million and a billion dollar plants, in some cases.(Laughter.)You are the ones Obstructing Justice.He looks like such a fool.It’s gonna happen.I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again.AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN AT EVERY LEVEL.NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country.That's not going to happen.Everybody wanted to leave.(Applause.)I had Perry came at me strong; he went down.I also know guys that are overrated.You know the story in Obamacare, they don’t have to take it.Thank you.I was on the ground in Texas yesterday to meet with Governor Abbott â€” who is doing, by the way, and incredible job â€” and local officials so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.I shouldn’t say that.We lose $58 billion a year in terms of imbalance.Take their guns away.Q    (Laughs).We just signed a budget that’s so bad and the Republicans – you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from.And I said, if you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East.But you know — although I think last night I gave her a big headache.Bye bye.Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present.You probably saw I’m going to spend — now, we’re going to start spending a lot of money because I don’t want to take any chances.You want to move to Mexico, build your factory, it’s going to be wonderful.I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing.We have an amazing country.Jobs have already started to surge.They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.Our Founding Fathers Understood Trade
George Washington said that “the promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.”
Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the “expediency of encouraging manufactur[ing] in the United States.” The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that: “The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government… must produce want and ruin among our people.”
Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax.So, we’re going to bring our jobs back.And he wasn’t a big name.No, what a lie – Katie Tur – what a lie it was from NBC to have written that.Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding.Q Iâ€™m sure you checked that out, sir.Much more.(Applause.)I’ve had such great support.Sheriff Joe from Arizona.They want to get rid of the bullets now, they’re doing everything they can —


Think of Paris, think of Los Angeles.But they’re very nice people.Forty thousand.Remember this.Thereâ€™s nobody I respect more.We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases.Well, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been talking about for a year and a half â€” strong borders.A lot of good things happened.Whoa.Whether itâ€™s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, itâ€™s going to build a lot of wall.We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can’t work.WE'RE NOT CLOSING GITMO.But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.(Applause.)I don’t even – honestly in all fairness to her, I don’t think she believes it.We didn’t talk about trade.What did you think?YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THIS ROOM.It costs other campaigns millions to get a report.WE WILL NEVER PAY FOR THE -- F-BOMB -- WALL.Q    So you donâ€™t feel a kinship with him?By the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldn’t make any difference.I’m not buying any more of them.I mean, if you’re a poker player and you’re predictable, you’re not going home with much money.He gave a date.So we canâ€™t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.They came to me -- the press.You gave them $150 billion.All these guys think that I’m a tough guy so I’m going to be so quick with the trigger.But I’m not happy.They’re coming – not coming at me.They’re not sending you (pointing again).Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.We don’t win anymore.That’s serious wall, right?A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.So Iâ€™m going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution.And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually â€” it wasnâ€™t a setup.But if we’re going to deliver real change, we’re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.We have great military but we can't beat ISIS.Hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they’re closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour.I can’t speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays.I got it built for peanuts.But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.So, you know, I went to like an Ivy League college and I have a lot of friends that are against guns and I argue with them.So I just want to thank – this endorsement meant so much to me from these two guys and from the whole community.We have not used the real abilities that we have.Oh, believe me, if itâ€™s off by 100th of a percent, itâ€™s like I end up getting Pinocchioâ€™s, right?THE PRESIDENT:  Letâ€™s not talk about it.I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade.He’s this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament.Weâ€™re going to bring back â€” could be $3 to $5 trillion from overseas, money that canâ€™t be brought back as part of our taxes.Iâ€™m wondering, sir, if you â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but thatâ€™s okay.I turned him down.It’s just not right.And I said that in 2003.(Laughter.)So, I’m sticking with you people.THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, thatâ€™s great.I just left Phoenix – 21,000 people.So if they didn’t say they got the money, which they all did, 100% got the money.We can’t.But they put it up.And nobody wants to say that, but Iâ€™ll say it right now.Instead, you pursued your next libelous and vicious crusadeâ€”you engineered an attempt to frame and defame an innocent person.Why aren’t they going to go and vote?By the way, they’re killing us on trade.I said, â€œWhere the hell did that come from?â€  I think it was the only one in over a year.But we’re doing well.Last year, I heard, through friends, the story of Alice Johnson.Why would politicians want to change a system that’s made them and their friends very, very wealthy?I’m rated number one in the polls with the Hispanics.That is a fact, and it’s a fact we need to talk about.It shifted.When the parents surround those schools and they love those kids and they love those pupils and even when their kids graduate, they are committed to those schools, they’re committed to education.This United States has tremendous problems of their own.Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do.(Applause.)But it’s still the New York Times.I have like this photographic memory so I don’t need – but I want to be sure because if I used the word "the" incorrectly, they’ll say, "He didn’t – "
"Favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month".It will be in Vietnam â€” Hanoi.And I tell you what else I see.It’s true.Do they undermine this countryâ€™s ability to work with Russia?We have to change.What I do best is build.When I’m president I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside our borders.I wouldn’t either if I had two, I swear I wouldn’t.No, I’m not going to do that yet but we have their approval.We do all sorts of exercise.This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible.We have some good business people in this audience.We’re under budget and ahead of schedule.But you know what?It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably — probably — from the Middle East.And we’re going to find ourselves a Patton and we’re going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women.I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.The world is a different place.(Applause.)We’re going to put these stupid, stupid people that allow and I’m talking about basically politicians, and in many cases, you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and I mean take a look at the Iran deal.I really do.THEY COME IN AND THEY ARE POURING OFF THESE BOATS.I sort of expected this.Believe me.They write these beautiful letters – "Mr. Trump, I can’t afford much and I know you don’t need it but I’m sending $50 because that’s so important what you’re saying about the country."Q    Should they be â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Wait â€”

Q    Should they be deciding policy, sir?Right?They went up 10 points.They know I’ll do great with China.So I just – I learned that they are terrific people in Iowa.Okay?The people that did it right, the people that did the best job got hurt the most.We love our police ...Janet Yellen should have raised the rates.I was killed by the press.Thereâ€™s nobody.He dislikes people.ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.Great businessman, very rich guy, very, very successful.At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country â€” (applause) â€” will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.They’re not supposed to.Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.And that’s what they’re doing.That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured â€” nobody talks about that â€” horribly â€” like, loss of legs and arms â€” going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.So politicians are bad people.(Applause.)I said, "I have to do it.The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration.That's the kind of potential we have.Nobody knows.I REALLY MEAN IT.100%.That was before Trump was going to happen.When I see that statistic, I mean you’re losing your jobs.So when I say "Mexico’s going to pay for it," these guys on the stage with me, they’re not business people.By the way, usually when a deal takes that long, it’s bad automatically.Thank you.This is something nobody can even understand.That’s not going to happen with me.But global warming – you noticed they changed the name – they go global warming, they go climate change, they go – now I hear a lot of extreme weather.THE PRESIDENT:  Say, â€œThank you, Mr. Trump.â€  (Laughter.)Who care?I think that ABC â€” I think â€” well, Fox â€” I like Fox.But I think it’s like 23 boxes.AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SO GREAT AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.And to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly, Right to Try.He says, "I’m the only one that can out-vote him."That’s what we want to do.Thereâ€™s one Chicago thatâ€™s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe.GREAT COMPANY.Education is very important to me.No longer will we tolerate one job-killing delay after another.And weâ€™ll all go down together, and what weâ€™ll do is weâ€™ll negotiate.I see some of the things.Because there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and we’re going to take this country back and we’re going to make this country so great again and so strong again.Just so you know.I want to see if I can get a deal done so that people donâ€™t get killed anymore.Every country is ripping us off.They get the cash.The things they say â€” Iâ€™ve known her for a long time.They didnâ€™t want to say that.But instead of putting our country first, you have decided to disgrace our country still further.Hey, this is out of the big book.Right?(Applause.)I know what was said.I’ve been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back.I like all the great builders.Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years.This alone will instantly save another two million jobs.The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.She was so amazing the way she walked up here and just spoke from the heart, and we all have to speak from the heart.They want to destroy our civilization, and he’s worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax.And I’ll tell you what else, middle income folks – their salaries haven’t gone up in 12 years.She never even came – flinched.THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.You see the corruptness.Your first claim, â€œAbuse of Power,â€ is a completely disingenuous, meritless, and baseless invention of your imagination.They ended up calling this guy "What do you think about Trump?"Well, it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles.Please.And heâ€™s being very well-received.Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home.Mostly.We have a tremendous deficit.There are so many great things we can do on health care.That’s a little bit like what I’m doing.THE PRESIDENT: And youâ€™re not related to our new â€”

Q I am not related, sir, no.Take me in for heaven’s sake.After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans.Because, you see, this election isn’t about Republican or Democrat.Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man.We have people – bureaucrats in Washington – telling you how your child should be educated in Iowa and New Hampshire and all of the different places that we go to.Q    Is it a winery or something?Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s time to declare our economic independence once again.I think it’s probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can’t get the money back to invest in this country.Was that terrorism?I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.I can â€” when I look at whatâ€™s happened to the reputation of a great gentleman â€” a great intellect; a brilliant man; somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court Justices in history, intellectually â€” I think itâ€™s a shame.Well, Tom Brady is a very good friend of mine.I don’t know if you know it.Theyâ€™re taking down plants.I have so many people.Could we maybe just go around the room and weâ€™ll introduce ourselves.It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.They’re not supposed to be doing that.You know, one of the things that makes me happy.No, they want to take it away.We have Lincoln and we have Jefferson and we have Dr. Martin Luther King, and we have â€” but they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office.And somebody told me today that somebody else – I think, Walker – used my term.BUT ONCE WE WENT INTO IRAQ, WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT THE WAY WE LEFT.That’s fine.She has a great husband, Jared, and I’ll tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and she’s very proud.Iâ€™ve been on it for 15 times this year.When millions of dollars are given to Cruz and Kasich and millions from different industries, you’re not going to be able to say, "Well, we’re going to do and go against the banking industry to do what’s right for the people" if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars.WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT MILITARY, AND BY THE WAY, I SAID FOR YEARS WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THE OIL.We protect you.Whenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs.I’ll tell you, you know, it’s like, I’ve never did this before.We protect them.Do you think Hillary Clinton can get through one?(Applause.)I mean, you can see them...This is where we’re going.Very disappointed with myself.You are making a mockery of impeachment and you are scarcely concealing your hatred of me, of the Republican Party, and tens of millions of patriotic Americans.And I’m just honored by it.China – taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base.It’s disgusting.Everybody thought the deal was dead.Scum.They say, "Is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?"Bomb.Thank you.I said, â€œDonâ€™t do it.â€  And Iâ€™ll tell you, it happened â€” where I was at a meeting with a lot of supporters, and a woman stood up and she said, â€œThereâ€™s a province in Syria with 3 million people.Thatâ€™s what we have borders for.We’re talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off.Just don’t waste your – "
...I’m going to Iowa.Honestly.So you know what, itâ€™s fine.Oh, what a beautiful accent.But we do have a real establishment and they’ve never seen this happen before.So somebody said, "How did they get there?"And by the way, when I speak to foreign countries, there are many people, with permission, listening to the call on both sides of the conversation.No, it’s true.And I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party.BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT BERNIE SANDERS AND I HAVE IN COMMON WAS TRADE.Look, when we send stuff over to China, it doesn’t get in.I’m a person – yeah, it’s going to be like this...If the press writes false stories like they did with this – half of you were amazed that I raised all of this money.And remember this, we are like the policemen of the world but we don’t get paid anything.(Applause.)Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.She will not be a good president.There are those people that probably wouldn’t have want him to back.Could we have your support?MR. SCHWAB:  Mr. President, I will ask you, maybe, a personal question.Because we have a ban.They have to work with us.The work has been unreal.Big.Effective or regular?YOU WANT TO SEE TRADE IMBALANCE, LOOK AT THE IMBALANCE WE HAVE WITH JAPAN.We decapitated Iraq and now Iran is taking over.You know, I’m doing the old post office or watch (ph) you (ph).Do they have any semblance of guilt?Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund â€” nice name â€” which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of Americaâ€™s existing and massive foreign aid payments.I see them all.And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.She doesnâ€™t have the capability to do it.And it’s just a different thing.And then there’s ISIS.I guarantee you could run it a lot cheaper.So we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China.And you know how I heard his name?Iâ€™m here to deliver a simple message:  There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States.What you’ve done has never, ever been done before?"I made a speech outside.That’s really nice.Thank you very much everybody.You know what I did?This event just happened.We don’t win anymore.They’re going to be a monster.That was – there have been many disasters.Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.But think of it.Excuse me.PEOPLE SHOULD HONOR DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY SIGN THEM.You are the ones subverting Americaâ€™s Democracy.I’m a very honest person...Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities.I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.Weâ€™re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.(Applause.)They didn’t mention?So they said, "He’ll never put in his financials."But we’re doing so well.And Iâ€™ll tell you what, that 9th Circuit â€” you have to see.There was with Bush.And after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.(Applause.)Beating everybody by a lot.And if I didnâ€™t get elected, believe me, they would have left.But nobody wanted to say it.Pretty close.But it’s possible – the world blew up around her.Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.The red one sells.Thank you.I think weâ€™re going to have some great surprises.And then he took one where I wasn’t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture.Weeks, weeks late.And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.You have a party called the Democrats and they’re going to have to make that choice.And people are now looking.I wonder why.Guys like Carl Icahn.The male shooter in San Bernardino again whose name I will not mention was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.Whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we’re babies.So when I talk and when I’m up on the stage with these guys, these people — wonderful people — and a very nice woman, Carly.And we will take care of our great veterans.We’ve given them $150 billion.They probably would have had him thrown out years ago.THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, THE WALL IS VITAL.He hasn’t won anything.You know, he was favored.Schools where our children can learn free from violence and free from fear.And Iâ€™m saying, hereâ€™s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.We lost â€” tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS.And the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful.We have stupid leadership.In this effort, we will be working hand-in-hand with our House leadership team â€” and Iâ€™ve really gotten to know them and they are winners and they are terrific people â€” terrific people.That’s my global — I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air....So whatever you can do to spread the world, I’ll be around.Q I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when youâ€™re providing information thatâ€™s fake?Itâ€™s under design, and youâ€™re going to see some very good things happening....We have such a problem.Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.Not only the number of deaths, which are obviously – that’s what’s going on is incredible.Weâ€™re going to work on it very hard.She says, "Darling, did you hear that?Ready?We continue to call on partners to confront Iranâ€™s support for terrorists and block Iranâ€™s path to a nuclear weapon.They’d move from New Jersey to Texas.She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done.To me, it was instructional.The fact is somebody comes in illegally and they have a baby, we’re not responsible.The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning.I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices â€” Iâ€™m not happy with OPEC.You know Mark Burnett.So I only say this and you know what?Q (Off mic.)But we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we’re going to bring back wealth to the United States so we can afford to save Social Security, which I’ll save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make America great again.And I think you’ll see we have an amazing code.They would have had great budgets.We don’t know if they’re Syrians.Somebody does a sign.They have riots in the street.Right?Doctors are quitting.And then jokingly, I said, "How long did it take to get started?Guys like Rubio, I mean, he desperately needs money.I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.(Applause.)Honestly, it’s horrible.We should not allow it to happen.We need more jobs, we need better wages â€” a lot better wages.Thank you, everybody.When you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here.And we have unbelievable police forces that don’t get the respect that they should get.They’re like gamblers.But in looking at these situations--  I built an incredible company.And I think we're going to do terrific and the SEC's (ph) going to be very, very exciting.Thatâ€™s not acceptable to me.I don’t know if they’ll give me an endorsement.Sheâ€™s been talking about that to me for two years, long before I even decided to go through this journey.Not too nervous.If we had a wall, we donâ€™t need the military because weâ€™d have a wall.And he said, "We’re going to build a wall at the southern border."I went.It will never, ever be the same.I was the one that said it first, and I mean it.Here’s the problem.Heâ€™s embarrassed.BUT IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF OBAMA, AND OBAMA CARE AND ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT DON'T WORK.So I backed McCain, he lost.Okay, thank you all very much.Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing Americaâ€™s interests.This is something that we didnâ€™t anticipate.We admit many more from other countries in the region....By the way, the Sheriff is here and he’s a great guy and his people are fantastic.And instead of being like "Thank you very much, Mr. Trump" or "Trump did a good job", everyone said, "Who got it?They’re big believers.We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.A friend of mine who’s a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.I am asking you to choose greatness.Itâ€™s gone.They’re so good.We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria.And we’re going to be able to save your Social Security.You have to do another amendment.It’s not going to happen.And thatâ€™s going to get taken care of.But give them their day in court.In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, â€œDonald Trump.â€  And the two people that asked her that question smiled.Because our armed forces was depleted.We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea.(Applause.)Illegal immigration.THE PRESIDENT: I donâ€™t want to be one of these guys that say, â€œYes, hereâ€™s what weâ€™re going to do.â€ I donâ€™t have to do that.(Applause.)I mean that.Without our protection, you would have real problems.I’m not angry at China.We will be there soon.I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA.NICE AND EASY.You know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can’t be — that nobody can do what they did, right?I called him up six months ago, told me the same thing.Yeah, go ahead, finish it.And I did have to mention her husband’s situation.More unsafe â€” you go to Afghanistan, right.In fact, we’re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.It disadvantages ordinary Americans who donâ€™t have an army of accountants while benefitting deep-pocketed special interests.Thatâ€™s been happening for decades and decades â€” not going to happen any longer.Remember?Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.That’s not good because terrible things are happening and we’re getting weaker and weaker.I think it’s going to go down as the worst single thing that’s ever happened to Israel.Weâ€™re fixing the inner cities.Yet, it is the exact opposite.But Planned Parenthood — millions of people — and I’ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped.They donâ€™t want that.I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.WHAT A LANDSLIDE THAT WAS.If I don’t make it, I don’t make it.So to the African-American people within the community, what do you have to lose?We can't forget it.When theyâ€™re in trouble, they always pull out the racist word.I loved it.So I just want to say that this was an exciting evening.But now they’re moving from here —  — not that many people are leaving New Jersey.Q Fixing the inner cities.I THINK I HAVE A GREAT TEMPERAMENT.I was in favor of her being – I think she should be in the debate.I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.Q    What about the message that you may be sending to young men?We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.And then at the end of the process â€” they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense â€” and at the end of the process, they get rejected.I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter.People have never seen this situation with China.In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize.It’s sort of an amazing thing.But you got to know where to use it and when.So today Iâ€™m calling on all members of Congress â€” Democrat, Republican and independent â€” to support pro-American tax reform.People view you as a tough cookie that’s not going to take this crap."Good evening.What does this moment that weâ€™re in â€” the cultural moment â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Itâ€™s a very big cultural moment.I mean, Bush has $125 million.But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong.Yes, Jon.People don’t realize.But 44%.You have a lot of them moving into South Carolina.But weâ€™ve gotten rid of a lot of them.He said, "Even if you don’t win, what you’ve done is incredible; you’ve totally changed the landscape of politics."And I’ll tell you and I’ve been saying it.If you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb.And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson.And honestly, nobody knows who to believe.But more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you’re putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody’s done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it.We’ve got to stop it.If it does get in, you have to pay a big tax.Our southern border will be protected always.Yet, when the monstrous lie was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy dissolved into dust, you did not apologize.Q Well, when you say â€” when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your â€”

THE PRESIDENT: Am I going include who?Okay?And I hit Rand, Rand, old Rand.I watched last night and I watched the president truly that didn’t know what he was doing.Remember how that was?I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.Come here, Steve.You are unwilling and unable to accept the verdict issued at the ballot box during the great Election of 2016.(Applause.)When I went after your governor when he decided to run and I said, "You know, I’m going to be nice to him.Pay off our debt.No, don’t applaud, don’t applaud, don’t applaud.I did great.Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy.So, here is the story.But I do.For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%.We’re number one in costs.He wants to take over the entire government, and heâ€™s going to do it.It’s beautiful what’s happening.But weâ€™re going to get rid of those terrible, terrible regulations.And we owe them the exact same amount.I say fan the crowd and they never fan it.You getting out to vote.And honestly, I’ve been watching all the pundits.And it’s been fun and it’s been interesting.They had a really bad accident.Hard to imagine what’s happened to our country.They’d leave – today they’d leave this country for other countries.I don’t have to give him a big speech.Or where are you from?But it’s too bad.We’re going to win.Q You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.Because I can’t be so nice and say "We can all do a wonderful job".The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before.Maybe the worst transaction I’ve ever seen negotiated.Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.Now, I could be doing â€” I could be doing this all day long.And they just said it.Oh, we love South Carolina.These people are living in a different planet.No matter where we go, it’s amazing.I'M TELLING YOU, FOLKS, AND I TELL IT ALL OF THE TIME, BECAUSE AS A REPUBLICAN, AND AS A REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE, WE ARE AT A TREMENDOUS DISADVANTAGE.But you know the one bad thing?I do have to know the name of the group because, who knows?We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what’s going on right now.I like Ted Cruz a lot.WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action â€“ constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.Iowa.They were saying how I lost.(Applause.)People donâ€™t realize, I have to say, what a mess we inherited.You know, they’re — a lot of them are nice people.(Applause.)Finally, I want to get to taxes.Hi, Lynne, how are you?I asked Mark yesterday, "What are they doing?People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying.Thank you, Ann.These guys – and I don’t think we’ll have to.Then they write me a letter, which I posted, asking me for $1 million.Mexico is killing us -- absolutely.Plus, if you think, Iâ€™ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down – too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears.And they had alarms going off; you know that.Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down.But they were hacked, and terrible things came.Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that.Never again.THE PRESIDENT:  â€” a mile away from where I went.So, they have a jeep — over, down, bump, make money.WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA, CANNOT STAND ALL OF THESE VICTORIES.Just three weeks ago, Debraâ€™s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien.And I am going to try â€” I will do everything within my power to fix that.I see it.This is evil.Come on.And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.And he thought it was a joke.I mean, I am learning.I think if she stays in, he might not.Oh, we are going to help your daughter.But it’s called vetting.I HAVE SUCH GREAT VETERAN SUPPORT.Q    Senator McCain defined them as the same group â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at â€” excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?I think we’re doing a lot better than anyone knows.(Applause.)Give me a break.Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests.She came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized.The problem with the Iran deal was that Secretary Kerry was like an amateur.HE GETS THE JOB DONE.I never even gotten a letter of thank you.(Applause.)They have no idea.Did you see any change in her face?It’s — the level of stupidity is incredible.You forced our Nation through turmoil and torment over a wholly fabricated story, illegally purchased from a foreign spy by Hillary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault our democracy.Now, I haven’t been asked about NATO a lot but I understand NATO and I understand common sense, and I’m like a smart person like many of the people in this room."Dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, "Honey, who cares?And the press conference lasted a long time.I’m competing with the musical talent.As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA.But what do they also get out of that deal?It was fake news.But I have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have.I’m looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it’s up.Tremendous taxes over there.I just got the best hotel in North America.Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening.I just want a debate.Now, every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they’re getting a final approval from the government.But somebody puts up a sign.You leave.I take and take.Q    â€” or have you already made up your mind?Poll was good – way, way ahead of anybody else nationwide.Thank you.Itâ€™s going to be great.Okay?We’re going to take this system apart.It’s too long."Pretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War.They’ve lied to us.I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.Do you do that, Des Moines Register?I mean, look.We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.He’s a moron.He’s a good guy.The TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas.We get Bergdahl, a traitor.And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the– a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint.You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems.Yeah, I canâ€™t tell you now, but it came â€” it didnâ€™t come out of nowhere, that I can tell you.Q    Here we go.It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it.Somebody else would have it, probably maybe Iraq because he would have come back.I’ve toured so many of the states.Incredible people.But that’s who I am.But yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level Hispanic commentator.We’re going in the wrong direction.HERE IS MY DEFINITION OF TRADE.And let me tell you, we have some wonderful people over here and they’re here illegally but they’re wonderful people.That’s not going to happen with me.I KNOW FREE AND I KNOW EVERY FORM OF TRADE KNOWN TO MANKIND.I think he’s been treated very badly.It’s called life.Now, that’s true with Hillary also.Q Thank you, Mr. President.My kids love those two guys.Let somebody else have a day in court.I said, â€œThatâ€™s too bad.I put it out before the American people.Okay?Itâ€™s not like itâ€™s complicated.YOU'RE ON THE COVER.So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don’t know how he stays here.Look how dangerous.Eugene Washington, a man I like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there.I mean, you look at the omnibus budget from three months he got everything he wanted – fund Obamacare, bring people into the country that shouldn’t be here.I think.[SILENCE]


Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community....We’re ending Common Core.People that are doing badly.I want the facts.I said, "Very interesting."Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website.Nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office, the Washington Post published a story headlined, â€œThe Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.â€  Less than three months after my inauguration, Representative Maxine Waters stated, â€œIâ€™m going to fight every day until heâ€™s impeached.â€  House Democrats introduced the first impeachment resolution against me within months of my inauguration, for what will be regarded as one of our countryâ€™s best decisions, the firing of James Comey (see Inspector General Reports)â€”who the world now knows is one of the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen.We have companies coming back into our country.Too much work, too many people, blood, sweat, and tears.We’re reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country.(Applause.)It also means we must change our foreign policy.THE PRESIDENT:  The people are going to be working, theyâ€™re going to be making a lot of money â€” much more money than they ever thought possible.And we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership.Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike — and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest.How much do I get?Right?Look at the worst education.We will confront hardships.Because you had Iraq and you had Iran.I consider that an asset.Mexico’s going to pay for the wall.And itâ€™s unnecessary.Could be that we donâ€™t work it out.Our number are through the roof.On the budget, Trump – this is with 15 people remaining – Trump 51%.They’ve been unbelievable.We don’t win anymore.They think they’re hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say.You have no safety.Itâ€™s me?But it's happening more and more.Weâ€™ll do it the right way.But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.We’re leading everywhere.Thank you very much.He wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me.We don’t talk about that too much.WE'RE GOING TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.That’s long-term debt, very low interest rates.Right?We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.Youâ€™re a very wealthy country.Obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere.Two weeks later, the place was blown up.I filed papers where everyone said "Wow, that is unbelievable."Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam.Some of them havenâ€™t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.So if I don’t give the answer, I’m not going to win."They want to destroy us.I have guys ...






Carl Icahn endorsed me.YOU KNOW, NOT A BIG DEAL.When he landed the plane recently in China, right, they refused to give him a stairway out of Air Force One.And we’re doing fantastic with all the young and middle.So when I started, I said we have to do something about it.I don’t like Monmouth.We need some of that thinking.Me, I’m going to do the right thing.We have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source.We’re being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed."He is not a conservative."So ...






 Could be -- it could be any second.And he was stupid enough to write me a note.A couple of more.Itâ€™s all fake news.And weâ€™re going to start winning again, and youâ€™re going to be leading the charge.Incredible people.But with all of that the statements were so good.I was getting these little polls.I may be wrong.They’re leaving.So if you’re looking for a job and you can’t find it and you stop for a while – you know, after a while you sort of like "It’s not happening.We have to preserve it and cherish it.AND SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, SIR, THEY'RE WINNING TOO MUCH.Our veterans are treated so badly.You use anything you can.Q    The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Say it.They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it.(Applause.)The debate last week – everybody watched the debate.I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room.But I think it should be straight.Then Kate killed in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, by an illegal immigrant.All of this, and so much more, is possible.He’s got a great future.Whereâ€™s Bob?They would have been in trouble.I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.But in one case youâ€™re talking about classified.On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition.They won’t be too smart when I put my people there.We got to start the tax reductions.Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us.ISIS has the oil.That’s a real positive...Nobody’s tougher than me.Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State â€” it is unsustainable and collapsing.I hate to tell you.I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these ...You know it’s true.He’s representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and I’m way up in Florida over everybody.He looks like a dumb guy, I’m telling you.We will do very, very well, very, very well.I PROMISE.It’s economics.I have nothing to do with Russia, havenâ€™t made a phone call to Russia in years.I donâ€™t think so.Far greater.The word is renewal.You’re talking about Iowa?He wanted to buy Caterpillar...
Well China is doing that times 100, times 1,000, and what they’re doing is the devaluation of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete.When I saw that at the tape, at first I said, "Oh, this is terrible."Itâ€™s a big con game.But if America fights, it must only fight to win.Don’t worry about it."Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?And I want to thank everybody.I have a wonderful guy – campaign manager.Then, his father cried out with joy, â€œItâ€™s the Americans!But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.Plus, we want to find out who’s in the good group.That woman!We’d be much stronger because the Middle East is a disaster.Remember: Make America great again.But you know what?That's more than Richard Nixon.Please.I tell you what, the United States is counting on it.So I donâ€™t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement.It had to be a record for a house.For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.We’ve got to stop it.We're bringing our jobs back, folks.We’re being led by stupid people.(Laughter.)No, no, but if you want a nice person.They said, "We won’t do that.He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect.I really believe that President Obama would admit that he said itâ€™s by far his biggest problem.So I did â€” I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.I wonder, is it George Washington next week?And weâ€™re leading in many of the battleground states all over the country.It’s costing us $200 billion a year immigration in this country right now.I didn’t want guns.And here is your pledge.Iâ€™m a messenger.Right?YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN INNER CITIES, AND LOOK AT CHICAGO.We don’t use them.We have to be tough.It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower.So it’s been a real focus.Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence.Saudi Arabia without us is gone.I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible.Weâ€™ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.Q I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.I let him know that I’m not interested.And are you coming along okay?'Cause Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months.And they did a story where they – I didn’t know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media.And we got it done.Oh boy, were they looking.We can’t have it.If we don't--  The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed.They couldnâ€™t get them into these massive arenas â€” thereâ€™s something going on thatâ€™s really incredible in this country.A couple of them got up.I made a business deal a year ago.Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way.Iâ€™ve already done a lot of wall, for the election â€” 2020.It’s not even close.Whereas the Democrats went down.We owe them $1.4 trillion.I wasn’t looking for the credit.I’ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it’s not the right thing.I come into your neighborhood, right.I WOULD HAVE HONORED IT.There’s 17 people.What they’re doing to us with those documents, and Cruz is the one that insisted that we can’t talk about money manipulation, which is devaluation of currencies in the agreement.I want a lot of things.I like to see how did I do?So, we have 93 million people out of the labor force.We’re letting all of these people — hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they’re doing is adding to this incredible problem we have.I have to do it."Yes.And this is something that’s so special and so amazing and it’s on the cover of time magazine.We believe â€” especially the people in Tennessee, I know you people so well â€” (applause) â€” in peace through strength.They control the mayorâ€™s offices, the school boards, the city councils and the seats in Congress.You know?I mean, the only thing I feel so guilty about all the people outside.I would say, how are we doing?I said, "I won’t win."Believe me.And had I known that I was going to be liked as much as I am in Iowa and people did like me – you will understand that – I would have maybe spent a little bit more and I would have been there a little bit more and maybe I would have won it.In fact, they’re asking Cruz, you know, at the debate which by the way they said I won every single debate.We let people go out of Gitmo and they kill Americans.Greater then every before.If we had the wall, it would be very easy.The last thing on my mind I want to be was a politician.It sounds bad.They dump massive amounts of steel.And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the Grand Hyatt Hotel.We’re going to win with education.Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.We conquer the unknown.So, he would remember (ph) it.Now they want to have more debates — "Oh, can we have more?I don’t like the fact that there are 11 people now as I understand it.The Hispanics.We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none.That’s their number one weapon and the trade that we’re making doesn’t cover it.I want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens.Iâ€™ve been given good reviews.HOUDINI COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OUT.(Applause.)...Jeb again, right?And we ended up raising almost $6 million.We have such an amazing relationship with Hispanics and they’re great people.My job is not to represent the world.My name is TomÃ¡s Regalado from Radio and TV Marti.At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.Trump says don’t do Iraq.We’re negotiators.Okay?Woman:
So we thank you.It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000.Thank you very much.Iâ€™ve heard so much about you.They said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million.You have to go through a process.We have a very good relationship.Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.We’re going to be watching your boy.Now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something.Really hard.Unemployment rate – well, they say – that can’t be possible.And we tweeted about it.Instead, they talked about fantasy football.And what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals.We have the most incredible new jets and everything.But I think Des Moines Register has somebody says it’s coming out sometime.I look at this guy Jeb Bush.It’s like a great athlete.They’re rapists.Your campaign — there’s never been anything like it."Iâ€™m there.WE'RE WINNING AT THE BORDER.It is so incompetent.Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money.And they said bringing peace to Syria.But it’s got to be good trade for us, right?There’s a lot of people, a lot of countries being given a free ride.We’re together tonight.I want a podium.Hey, look at the campaign.Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.And for the last — and leading a lot.But with Canada, itâ€™s very tough.And I will fight to bring us all together as one people.Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, ran his first campaign for public office in 1832 â€” when he was only 23 years old.A whole different world out there right now.And he came on – just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it now…it went to number one.It’s the cheapest thing we can do.We have 93 million people.He hasn’t won.Look, I’m telling you — you know how I’m going to bring them back?They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us.25%.And you'll see that.Last night in Dallas at the American Airlines Center, 20,000 people – the basketball arena of the Mavericks.You know, 42% with like 14 people that’s pretty good.We have to be a little bit unpredictable.(Applause.)I mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.(Applause.)I mean, it’s so little.But a lot of these groups – getting vetted by, you know, when you pay the money out, they need government documentation.And I think â€” and theyâ€™re all saying the Trump people are going to turn out.I’m working very hard and there is great anger.But its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America.It was very important â€” excuse me, excuse me â€” it was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly.And one of the things that they don’t take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting.It’s not — I don’t think it’s good.By the way, I’ve used the laws to my advantage and companies.But I know you well enough.They just announced North Carolina.You know they couldn’t get environmental impact statements.It’s like a form of extortion, I guess.How are these people gonna lead us?We’re going to win in November.These numbers I hated to look at.I’m a messenger.Theyâ€™re very good people.WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.But he said, "You’ve got to come in."I mean, I don’t know.Those are the big jets.Q    Can you tell us broadly what your â€” do you still have confidence in Steve?I’m a big believer especially in clean air and clean water.We are going to straighten a lot of things.And then you hear the announcers.I am a conservative.They built it in about one year, this massive military port.They don’t need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them.Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?They’re controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions.But we can’t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again.Our Founders feared the tribalization of partisan politics, and you are bringing their worst fears to life.Believe me.And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.I HATED, I HATED WATCHING IT.We’re going to try getting rid of – and I’ve said that to a lot of evangelicals, a lot of great Christians.They’re going to come in through a process.Iâ€™ve loved it.That’s why I say, I mean, some people say it’s worst than stupidity.We are going to have victories again.Spoiled guy.This has never happened to China.We must build bridges of cooperation and trust â€” not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, itâ€™s what it is, division.And remember this.Incredible man.Now, we have really 15 – I would say – look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to 13,000.We have to do it."YOU KNOW, UNITED STATES, THEY SAID HAD NEVER LOST A WAR.And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well.Q    Thank you very much.Now, she shouldn’t be allowed to run.AND, YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY TWO WEEKS AGO, A MONTH AGO, I WOULDN'T BE SAYING THESE WORDS.Everyoneâ€™s an Islamophobe.The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something.The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.We don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it.We virtually ended the estate tax â€” or death tax, as it is often called â€” on small businesses for ranchers and also for family farms.Wouldn’t it be nice if our country could have that same thing?I don’t know.Radical Islamic terrorism.And it's not that she believes in it.Now it’s time for the American people to take back their future.When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly.And because it wasn’t really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes.They don’t want us there.(Applause.)It’s true, and these are the best and the finest.He’s getting some free publicity.She was not nice and I was fine, just a little bit of a jab.We went to Dallas – 20,000 people in Dallas.And theyâ€™re very happy.Get out and vote!Iâ€™ve â€”

Q    Has there ever been an instance when youâ€™ve given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?THE PRESIDENT: Oh, Iâ€™m working on it.Good.THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE.EXCEPT FOR THE REAL ENEMY.As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly shared prosperity and rewards to those who play by the rules.And our economy now is hotter than itâ€™s ever been.Thank you.More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel, many people turned down this honor.THE PRESIDENT:  No.I said what the hell is this?So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.So, and so many different elements, and I’ve been talking about trade.You know, North Korea is very mountainous.We can’t let it happen."Oh, okay.You know that.But Iâ€™m not making anything near what they want to do.Trade with China, how big does that get?AND YOU SEE THE CRIME RATE IN LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY IS GOING WAY UP.(Applause.)You saw it in Orlando.Thank you very much.And by the way, more money is coming in.A lot of people donâ€™t know exactly what it is.Is that too much to ask?I did that.You’re going to speak to Carl Icahn."I always talk about Ford.I just – you’re not going to be – who’s the wise guy?Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.It can go other places.Insurance companies are fleeing.But if Cruz wins, remember what I said.I have received letters – heartfelt letters.We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher.But it wasnâ€™t classified information.I see Rubio on the ads all day long.Great deal maker.They don’t build ships like this anymore, folks.And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if thatâ€™s possible.(Applause.)AND WE HAVE ALL OF THE CARDS.You never get tired of winning, right?I shouldnâ€™t be sued.Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result.I hire people, they do a Web site.in Arizona.This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.But I really think that — I think it’s a great question, David, because I really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening, and everybody, is the Republican Party has become more dynamic.I always talk about trade.He’s failed us and he’s failed us badly.Because there is no such thing as a political hack.How much longer should we stay here, folks?And so I said number one, it’s obsolete.There were many times that.AND THE RASMUSSEN POLL JUST CAME OUT, WE'RE LEADING NASHLTIONALLY.And when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me.But I guess they didnâ€™t, and thatâ€™s okay.Vladimir Putin was on 60 Minutes with me three weeks ago.They do at will.The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion.We are going to preserve our Second Amendment.And then what happened – I ran against all these Senators and Governors.We failed to develop a new vision for a new time.They think it’s almost like an impossible number – how can it be so bad?Over here the other day we had a 9,000 -- we had a 10,000 -- we have people.Very big numbers.With Democrats with the whole super delegate thing, it’s ridiculous.Q    Well, Iâ€™m saying, as Senator â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  No, define it for me.It was terrible.Weâ€™re going to be fair.When will you attack them?I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight.So weâ€™ll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.We have people that don’t have it.It’s amazing.And they’re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons – one of the big reasons – as you know is taxes.But it would be much easier for me to be so tough â€” the tougher I am on Russia, the better.I like him.But she responded – yeah, you get that, right?We’re going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4.And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it.Fortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect.So if the Democrats, who have â€” all you have to do is look at where they are right now â€” the only thing they can do is delay, because theyâ€™ve screwed things up royally, believe me.The wall is going to cost $10 to $12 billion, OK?I guess I donâ€™t understand.We have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we’re going to redo those trade deals and it’s going to be a thing of beauty.So, Obama is the worst thing that’s ever happened to Israel.We had a very good talk, especially the second one â€” lasted for a pretty long period of time.I used it for myself, except that I won by such big margins that the whole system is rigged on both sides.YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WAS ALL LIES, FOLKS.I don’t know if you know this, but just a few weeks before San Bernardino, the slaughter, that’s all it was was a slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words "radical Islam."We’re going to take care of them.I wanted fairness.That’s not a good deal compared to the other deal."I want them to have a great economy.And Iâ€™m honored by it.Because I think if I win Iowa, New Hampshire is amazing.I said, "It’s so easy."(Applause.)If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, thatâ€™s a good thing, not a bad thing."I was fighting for ISIS."But it would be nice to see – because I’ll tell you what, he takes my votes away much more than he does Cruz.Thank you.In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders.Can you believe that?So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.So I have a good chance.THEY ARE FIGHTING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YEMEN.Everybody can be c-- This plan is just a basic disaster.So, look, here’s the story.Now, the Second Amendment means a lot of other things too...The Second Amendment in under siege.AND WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG.Well, look, I don’t expect — I have a lot of respect for Reince and for the group and I like the RNC and I don’t know that I’ve been treated fairly or not.But he is right.Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold Iran totally accountable.(Applause.)Have a good time.(Laughter.)Q But arenâ€™t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the peopleâ€™s faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you donâ€™t like â€œfake newsâ€?How about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine?Total state debt is $45 billion.Everything’s nice.I would have never thought this could have happened.We use donors to negotiate with China because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be.You know, the black background.I believe – because I’m a dealmaker – I believe that I can put both sides together.America is open for business, and we are competitive once again.Itâ€™ll be interesting to hear what she has to say.We’re going to make our country rich.But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly.I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis â€” heâ€™s over there now, working very hard â€” to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.Yeah, go ahead.I’ve been at 42%, 44%, 45%, and I’ve had like seven people.(Applause.)I didn’t need to do this.She supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what’s going wrong with our country and our borders.I said, "What do you mean?"Itâ€™s why new businesses and investment are flooding in.I told Mike Pompeo, I said, â€œMike, donâ€™t get into the time game.â€  We stopped them.They moved them a third time, they came right back.(Laughter.)There’s been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it.But somebody said, â€œPresident Trump lost on the ban.â€  Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.We have people that aren’t smart.It’ll add to the excitement in Cleveland and that’s good.I OFTEN JOKE, YOU'LL BE CALLING UP MIKE PENCE, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE YOUR GOVERNOR OR YOUR VICE PRESIDENT OR WHO THE HELL KNOWS.Number one, it’s a good – it’s called an enforced diet.Yes, maâ€™am.Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the Russian Witch Hunt.We have a president right now that doesn’t have energy.We should work — thank you.Take the oil.It’s a quality of life issue.No vision.I mean, Bernie Sanders has brought her to positions that she didn’t want to be at.And by the way we’ve spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the Middle East and it has been complete and total disaster.(Applause.)How am I preparing for my SNL?I want ISIS to surrender.We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it does impact my opinion.What are we doing?So I’m not going to say it because those guys will say "Well, he was wrong."They really have been very fair.THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA CAN'T STAND IT.Q    (Inaudible.)They haven’t done anything.We’re doing so well and I love this place and I’m back here all the time and I’m going to be here a lot in January.I don’t want to really knock them, I don’t want to mention their names.And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.Iâ€™ll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship.Did I look good?Those are great people.These people are horrible.We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.Okay?No, I’m going.And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines â€” (applause) â€” which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.And one of the reporters â€” I wonâ€™t say that it was John Roberts that said that, I refuse.I would say there’s less than 1% chance.I have so much false press about me.Our veterans are taken worse care of than illegal immigrants who come in our country...You don’t even have to write it down.She said, "If you don’t run, you’re never going to poll before.Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.They couldn’t get it.(Applause.)(Applause.)Weâ€™ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.Now they’re coming at us in full force.Let it be for everybody.This is what we will bring it down to.Much of this money was paid a long time ago.Thank you very much.Now I heard the other night, "I want to debate Trump".And for the most part we havenâ€™t even started spending our money yet.You double up the sanctions.Let me ask you a question.A friend asked me, "Please see them."Probably here you have some great companies, some really good smaller companies, you can’t get the banks to give you money.But if we canâ€™t, weâ€™ll terminate it and weâ€™ll start all over again with a real deal.Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump.But during the good old — they were making a billion — listen to this — a billion dollars a day, and we protect them.The difference is he didn’t get any response.American steel will send new skyscrapers right here in Miami into the clouds.I think we’re going to do well.I said "What?"The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam.It can happen.We’re going to look at a lot of different things.They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.Hillary is a disaster on the Second Amendment....I’ll pledge this to Iowa.I think healthcare is probably tougher, okay?A ranting and raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, declared just hours after she was sworn into office, â€œWeâ€™re gonna go in there and weâ€™re gonna impeach the motherf****r.â€  Representative Al Green said in May, â€œIâ€™m concerned that if we donâ€™t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.â€  Again, you and your allies said, and did, all of these things long before you ever heard of President Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine.And weâ€™ll do it with democracy.There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office.It’s not a friend to freedom.We’re going to come back.And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it.You want them all to love you unless you’re stupid.Sergeant Bergdahl, all right?We win.We’re going to be saying it...
And I won with women.Q    Thank you.I know in one case…like $150,000 a month.No, it’s not going to happen.And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, thatâ€™s â€” I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.It’s an economic behemoth.And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he’s coming from, I think people are going to say, "Whoa, we didn’t know that."You don’t reward behavior like that.Okay?I am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state.We’re going to make our country so strong and so wonderful.I didn’t know who did it.We got it.Q    Itâ€™s a habit of mine.You came at us from 15 different angles."We now have a good relationship.That’s my own problem.No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn’t like him in all fairness.I don’t do any of that stuff.Almost no interest.We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.Youâ€™re going to be getting a total gem.They also have self-inspection.My administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States.We totally blew it.But they did a very massive poll and I came out number one in leadership, number one on the economy, number one in jobs producing.Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but theyâ€™ll soon be under renegotiation.I visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.But except, I’m not a speaker.I’m building on Pennsylvania Avenue an incredible hotel.I’m a little bit down.I do, and I always will.Thank you.And I guarantee you...






...So we’ll see.He called me the other day.I’m trying to make a point, right?What I want is common sense.But with me, I don’t care that much.(Applause.)This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate.Do you ever notice?So no money – it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money.The one good thing?Arafat rejected it.The next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart.He’s a bad negotiator.I have to tell you that I’ve competed all my life.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.And they come out with the story "Trump files bankruptcy".I think what she did was very bad and I think a lot of people have done a lot less than her and their lives have been destroyed.You know what happened?China.You know, I think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe — except every time there is a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they are on drugs or something, cause some of those guys, it’s like.Who came down.And he should be â€” heâ€™s the most brilliant person.Weâ€™re all good students â€” some are bad students, but even if youâ€™re a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.(Applause.)Running for president, believe me, takes guts.It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.Now think of it.WE DON'T WIN ANY MORE.There’s something going on, folks.Now, remember this, I go every night to someplace.And actually, one of the pundits – because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits.Did you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor?I love it.He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen.And they don’t understand it.(Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.We owe China $1.7 trillion.REMEMBER THAT.Do you think I can take you in a fight?We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.And I said, "By the way, what are you going to do now?"WE'RE GOING REMEMBER THAT THEY DO A FABULOUS JOB.As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000.He has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened.No responsible leader can put the workers â€” and the people â€” of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.One of the higher ones.I turned on the game.So he would never make it.I don’t see how he can win.PLEASE, WE'RE WINNING WITH OUR MILITARY.It takes a lot of guts.Thank you.Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.And it showed a company that’s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow.That was a little bit rough.I must tell you, itâ€™s â€” I donâ€™t mind your question because â€”

Q    Raheem Rashidi, from Kurdistan TV.I don’t know if that’s going to help me in the negotiation.And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden China stops buying.So the press has to be responsible.I think he’s a very good man.They said it couldnâ€™t be done.You do not know, nor do you care, the great damage and hurt you have inflicted upon wonderful and loving members of my family.President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.You don’t know the power that you have.She’s being protected.But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.Who is he?"We want to remain a free and open society.(Applause.)Not going to happen anymore folks.And he asked a question to President Moon of South Korea.They go this way, 10 feet.WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING FROM INDIANAPOLIS.We can save our country.You know, I told you I made commercials for Bibi.Let’s get to work!Please.It was very badly depleted.So this is what it takes.Itâ€™s a depleted military.But anybody that knows her understands that.I will tell you this: You can’t educate your children through bureaucrats in Washington.While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record.We’re never going to have to use it.Total.Okay.Thank you very much, everybody.Weâ€™re going to bring jobs back.So it’s just been an amazing evening.The father’s a friend of mine – a great guy.I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel.In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.(Applause.)Thatâ€™s the stairs they drop down to get the mechanics up to fix the light bulb, right.Heâ€™s a tremendous man.And actually, infrastructure is something that I think weâ€™ll have bipartisan support on.And the hardest working followers.OKAY.George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists.Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.Are you saying that all three of those women are liars?You know why?You can even check.Obamacare’s dead but we’ll terminate it quicker than that.Very simple.So and you mean no PP.I have a very good relationship with Marco.Q    And is it okay if I give it to the New York Times?93 million.It’s going so fast.And we’re going to build a wall and we’re going to get, you know, the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes.I saw a guy the other day.They have been through something that nobody could ever experience.Look, Club for Growth – you ever hear this?Go ahead.These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.BUT THEY SHOULD HONOR THEM.THE PRESIDENT:  Thatâ€™s great.Now, the bad news is they’re always wrong.When I fight, I win.They have a target on their heart.Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, itâ€™s one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right?Beautiful.I really got nothing.You know, all these guys come to Forbes.Think of it.They build a ramp.I’m sure.We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.Hey, I’m the most conservative on the border.So yeah, I think it’s not a question of presidential ...There's going to be respect again for law and order.I said, "You know, I think we’re going to have spend money just to spend money" but it’s not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot.Now that is a first in the history of Air Force One.So, we started and something happened called Paris."Okay, good.Okay?She was sleeping.We have the best in the world.Go ahead.It’s very important to me, very important to me.So, they’re very conservative numbers.I have no special interest.As you know, President Obama gave them a pass and I didnâ€™t like it.The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before.Mr. President, I need to find out from you â€” you said something as it relates to inner cities.Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.Cause I always have — like, look at this room, packed.Your turn, get over here, boom.So when we first started, I talked about China how they’re ripping us and Japan and Mexico.WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.Not about money.In this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China.THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.So we have a very, very dynamic party and I think we’re going to be able to unify the party.And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did.Georgia.Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn.(Applause.)So it says "$50 million or more", I go 50.But you know, some of these guys try to copy it but I had it trademarked because we’re smart.In recent years â€” (applause) â€” in recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago.Q    Mr. President.And I started to realize that peace between Israel and the Palestinians, for the Middle East, is a very important thing.We’re all watching.But I â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  The Times are very interesting, though.They draw big salaries.The wall behind me is very, very special.He said exactly that.Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.That’s better than being a real estate broker.Iâ€™m happy if theyâ€™re happy.I got out took a picture.For them not for us.I love the people.In other words, if they do not treat us fairly.And I said, "How it is possible to win?"So anyway, I would like to — look, I just want to end by thanking everybody.You need – I’ve produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year.Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us.Signing executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run.The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution.And whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years ago â€” in fact, they donâ€™t even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is.Most of them was made up.And in a couple of cases, they werenâ€™t Republicans.PROBABLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE'RE UP TO $4 TRILLION.Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal.But you know what?IT'S BEING DEPLETED SO BADLY.It was beautifully done.But you’ll never ever run for president."So, if I can â€” now, I love to negotiate things.WE ALL HAVE GREAT FATHERS, I HOPE.AUDIENCE:  USA!They don’t want to show this crowd tonight.The biggest in two decades.The cheapest thing.I mean, these people don’t mind being killed, can you believe it?We will build a wall.It’s operating now.The border city of El Paso, Texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime â€” one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nationâ€™s most dangerous cities.It’s $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion.Now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that.Thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor.We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.And with China — you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years.And weâ€™re never quitting, and weâ€™re never going away, and weâ€™re never, ever giving up.How the hell can you vote for this guy?But we’ll take it.Thank you very much everybody.Weâ€™re going to take care of it all.But I have to say this.Every – and just think of this.Phenomenal relationships.And that’s exactly what happened.BUT MY FATHER WOULD SAY TAKE THE LUMPS OUT.But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.I mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I’m sure they never talk.I had the largest vote getting in the history of a Republican primary except for one and I brought many of those extra people in.But thatâ€™s going to happen.Another mess I inherited.Theyâ€™re using equipment thatâ€™s old.Where?If you would’ve told me on June 16th, when I was with my wife, Melania, and we came down the escalator in Trump Tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this.We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants â€œDeath to Americaâ€ and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.And besides that, to do that kind of thing, to negotiate great trade deals, to re-enhance our â€” I mean look.Theyâ€™ll make it impossible through regulations for our product to be sold in their country, and yet theyâ€™ll sell their product routinely in our country.A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something.It’s called using your head.We will bring back our borders.Remember the brain.Or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament.I’ll talk to them.If we get the delegates, we’ve pulled out a knock-out.You need eminent domain.I think we’ll have a lot of money left over.I mean, they’re flipping coins.(Applause.)He’ll never run."Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league â€” Ford, General Motors, so many of them.China’s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.But coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children.Democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century, for 60 years, 75 years, even in some cases 100 years straight.Didn’t devote tremendous money to it.AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.Hello.Then it goes to 11%.They’re proud people.And thatâ€™s a shame.That’s a choice I put before the American people.Everyone says Trump won the debate.But he said he wants to abolish Medicare and one thing, people do like their Medicare; they do like it.We have all the power in China.Inner cities filled with new hope and new opportunity.We will do a good job.When the great Ford Motor Company – great company – when they build a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico, when Nabisco moves its massive plant to Mexico from Chicago, we can’t let it happen.And then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense.I wouldn’t want her either.We shouldn’t be saying it.We have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people.They’re not stupid.Believe me, we will make our country great again.But you go with everybody.But people – one of the reasons they say I’m doing so well because I let people know we’re going to bring jobs back.We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.I have to be nervous even talking to her, you’re so famous.One of the best reports theyâ€™ve seen in many years.But I wouldn’t say populist at all.So the drugs pour in and the money pours out.We can’t let this happen any longer.It doesnâ€™t matter to me.Because when you have 11, you’re not getting to hear me and you’re not getting to hear other people talking and I think that’s too bad.AND THEY LET HER GO.We’ll take care of all of that.Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give â€” theyâ€™re not giving classified information.But the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany.I’ve never saw – I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before.Itâ€™s been going on for many years.It has nothing to do with dress.They’ve taken our base.That’s a lot.President Obama has not been a friend to Israel.And believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they’re going to have them more so than ever before.Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline.And we are going to restore respect for our country and for its great and very beautiful flag.Then when I signed...that’s when you sign your life away.They never can come back.WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG BETTER WITH THESE COUNTRIES AND THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT US FAIRLY.Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.To make a great deal, you need two willing participants.Itâ€™s a great honor to be with you.Right?I’m really happy about that.Chelsea is such a great friend of Melissa Young and Melissa Young – I just want to bring her and Chelsea onto the stage and maybe Melissa would like to say something and Chelsea.Right?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think jobs can have a big impact.VERY MUCH.We’re going to get those miners back to work.But any deal I make toward the end, Iâ€™m going to bring Schumer â€” at least offer him â€” and Pelosi.I’ve won, and my life has been about winning, and that’s what I want to do for the country.I don’t want to think about it.Unlike a lot of reporters â€”

Q    Nazis were there.Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.AND THE SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL IN MANY WAYS, BUT REALLY BAD IN OTHERS.They’re not the JV.Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server.That’s what I do.We have to get discipline –
I mean, I have a case.Is it 20%?No, we’re lowering taxes very substantially.And I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics.We got a bad decision.That was a great deal.You mention something youâ€™re an Islamophobe.We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.We don’t want to get advertisements.No more golf if Bernie Sanders — no more golf.Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go – Florida – we have crowds that are maxed.Well, we just went over that.And then we’re looking at Hillary Clinton.Hereâ€™s another beauty.But I could pick a woman and she could have charges made from many years ago also.Yeah, they’re going to pay for it.Saudi Arabia, before the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day.Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country.You look at what’s going on with Syria.But we have to be treated a little bit fairly.And I’m just very proud to be a part of this.How dare — that’s — who’s going to do that?And we have to do something.And all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime and more failing schools.I have to say.They said it couldnâ€™t be done.The big leaders werenâ€™t there to greet him.Itâ€™s an invasion.I’ll give you another example.It was going to open up in ’17 – sometime during the year ’17.Weâ€™re having a big opening in two weeks.And you know, Cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech – "Sen. Jeff Sessions" – and then he comes out and he endorses me.They said they didn’t want to complicate – so now, we’re going to end up making a new deal probably at some point.Okay?It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich – in other words, it’s going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true – while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions.And then, they said, "What happened?"I mean, whatever it is I have to do.Thank you very much folks, I’ll take the job.(Applause.)Great golfing area, right?I just read – all I did, I stood up and I read statistics.We’re going to win so much.How did it start?They think $2.5 trillion overseas right now.When they go into vote, I don’t think they say "I’m going to vote for Trump because he’s self-funding and he’s not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera."The horror is beyond description.Go out and vote tomorrow.I will tell you, it was something that I really appreciated.YOU NEVER SAW CAMERAS MOVE LIKE THIS.We have to end — education has to be local....The press is going to have to check it because what do I know?28 different times that they know of and they wouldn’t have done it.He sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that "We are sending 50 soldiers in Iraq, Syria" and these soldiers have a big target on their backs.I love you all.I mean, this guy is – you just have to study him, folks.Except Iowa there was one poll – there was one poll, Monmouth – I’d never even heard Monmouth.Iâ€™m not saying they had to report it because itâ€™s a very personal thing.And by the way, speaking of that, you know, I was against going into Iraq.I’m going to do the right thing for you.It wasnâ€™t good.But came in and I said, "So what are you going to do?OK?I’ll tell you what we’re going to do, right?They went bankrupt.Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you’d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children.But to win the states that we’ve won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, Florida.Everybody knew I was being sarcastic and joking.Right?So Saturday, get out and vote.We have regulations cut to a level â€” in the history of our country, Klaus â€” this was reported recently.We want the best talent in the world.And they’re all over the place.So I canâ€™t tell you whether or not theyâ€™re liars until I hear them.I’d rather reverse it.Itâ€™s true.For every one percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs.Right?He’s taking my votes.It was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla the way he held that child that almost like a mother holding a baby – looks so beautiful and calm.By creating such a strong economy â€” you just look at your televisions or see whatâ€™s going on today; itâ€™s through the roof.We have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism.I have 33%.They’re gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.You know what’s going on.I want to take away some of your muster.These are campaign promises.And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one.IT IS VITAL.Jamielâ€™s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite.Remington unveiled the first typewriter.No, no, think of it.We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.Premiums have soared double digits and even triple digits.But they have to respect us and they have to understand where we’re coming from.Oh, good because it’ll get even higher ratings if they do that.But we had a great poll come in – CNN last couple of days – where we’re leading I think by 13 points in Iowa.Do you know if you want to become a citizen of Mexico – I love the Mexican people.THE PRESIDENT: Now, thatâ€™s what I call a nice question.I know the bad ones.They’re closing plants all over Michigan to build a plant in — in Mexico.But the only thing I can say is this: If I win Iowa, I think it’s over.And then there were many other things.Do you mind?And I’m different from all of the other candidates.(Applause.)WE HAVE A COUNTRY IN CHAOS.Okay?Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough.I’m putting up my own money.It’s an honor to be with you.Chuck knows it.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.You’ve got to be smart in life.You know, it used to be they’d move from New York to Florida.THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, weâ€™re not going to let it rain on your speech.An agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.We don’t need – some people say it’s not nice to say.The public isnâ€™t â€” they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.Q    And about Syria:  Sir, in your speech you did not mention â€”

THE PRESIDENT:  Uh, yes.Politicians are all talk, no action.They’re going to have the same standard as the poorest person in this room.(Laughter.)And you've all heard that hundreds of times.Because when I announced on June 16th coming down the escalator with Melania, it was like the Academy Awards.Now finally they started – after Paris they started bombing the oil.You have to announce you’re running because nobody’s going to believe you’re running."Somehow, that doesn’t sound so fair.But we had to go with the healthcare first.These politicians – are they really that dumb?"So one of the things we’re going to do is if Todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait – because the waits are unbelievable – 5, 6, 7 days sometimes.They know what’s going on.AND I'LL SAY THIS.Boy, they are bad.But think of it, if we’re losing that kind of money – that imbalance.The Bible tells us, â€œhow good and pleasant it is when Godâ€™s people live together in unity.â€

We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate Americaâ€™s centennial.You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood.The father even said he was running for President of that country.We’re not going to forget it.They were phenomenal.And you have like 90 days or something.That’s because people have heard me and they say "You’re such a nice person."I understand the rest of your question.I said to the crowd in Iowa – great crowd, 4,000 people – I said "Can I take it?I have to hear it.I had a big lobbyist asked me to have – he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign.They don’t understand.I just saw where for the last week she’s been hitting me really hard with the women card, OK?Get going.I’m a Presbyterian."That defies any rule in presidential politics that I’ve ever seen," said this highly respected man.Hillary had only softballs.I hate to give it up.THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.They always keep our equipment.SOMEBODY SAID, MR. TRUMP, SIR, THEY'RE GOING TO CALL IT THE TRUMP WALL.(Applause.)When you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted.We’re one of the worst in the world in education.Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.We’ve got to stop it.Right now – and you know it – we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans.Itâ€™s a con job.But I’d love it if we made them.You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI.I don’t know how many people like Bibi.We can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
