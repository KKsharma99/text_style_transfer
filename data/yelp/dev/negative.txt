gov.kasich of ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @golfchannel

the president: well, i would.and you know, ive met a lot tougher people but ive never met any human that lied as much as him.what bill did was stupid!congressman ron desantis a top student at yale and harvard law school is running for governor of the great state of florida.nobody.but they want a redo or do over.very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since ronald reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.i think maybe there’s no more important point.#makeamericagreatagain #imwithyou<url> <url>

yesterday in pittsburgh i was really impressed with congressman keith rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure).big danger.none of romney's leaked comments change the fact that obama is a complete disaster.the democrats have no message  not on economics not on taxes  not on jobs not on failing #obamacare.with proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base.because you know, weve got men, weve got women.#trumpfortriumph

this russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in hillary clinton's losing campaign."hes only worth $5 billion."if you ran for president i would vote for you.i would be willing to shut down government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall!they didn’t laugh at me.look what happened to friends of trump for less.china is just taking advantage of us.ill talk to the republican front-runner.dropping supplies into enemy hands is inconceivable.we have replaced many miles of old barrier with powerful new walls!i can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay?love people who are great under pressure.@foxandfriends  a very serious situation."time is money"---the art of the deal.its hard for me to turn down money because thats what ive done in my whole life.really they just gave me a standing o!@rtmatador trump says things that no one else would even consider saying i agree with him on the immigration situation i love honesty

wow @sharylattkisson  just wrote the definitive piece on what i said about john mccain <url>
one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians.thanks!this isnt some game.he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes border security and crime prevention.he is a great guy and player.our country is at stake!trump doesnt want money therefore we cant  even though hes better than all these guys, even though hes going to do more for israel than anybody else, even though bibi netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and i did and he won his race, so i was very happy about that.the next day, were watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart.im not going to tell anybody what to do.who would do this?@topsecret_pt: @realdonaldtrump - ireland scotland dubai!you should highlight that point.so, we are going to make our country so great.just took off for ceremony @ pearl harbor.staying at the trump hotel.massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped.slowing down the fun.he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama.our next president must stop china's rip-off of america.<url>
thank you arizona.you want to move to mexico, build your factory, its going to be wonderful.he is  fully vaccinated and ready for kindergarten in september.communities all over scotland are fighting this loser.must be chanded but i am bringing out the military for this national emergency.they can also cause war!at the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the american people for immigration enforcement and border security.!!and we need great trade deals and were going to make great trade deals.oil is secured.now everything about obamacare was a lie.i am not looking for an....totally lost it!and then if we want to buy  we want to move to another location, well, thats very expensive if we do that.interest rate costs should have been much lower &amp; gdp &amp; our countrys wealth accumulation much higher.puts our agents &amp; military overseas in danger.hopefully rick saccone will be another big win on tuesday.i should have easily won the trump university case on summary judgement but have a judge gonzalo curiel who is totally biased against me.@senrickscott  @senatemajldr @senjohnbarrasso  @senbillcassidy

@hillarysusans: @greta @realdonaldtrump that was such a great piece.obama must go!and i said it yesterday — it has to be eradicated just off the face of the earth.youre all focused on the way hes raising money and youre not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday.bernie has given up just like he did last time.entrepreneurs: don't put blinders on or limit yourself.not worth $30.its graduated.i want to thank and congratulate the republican national committee and reince priebus, who i just spoke to.thank you!i dont think the dems on the border committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal.honestly, i did, i always liked him but he became  you know, somebody told him youre losing very badly.no clue!.keep your momentum.negotiation is persuasion more than power.@eamyoncanoe  cute boy nice.@sal_lyann: donaldtrump @jennifer75ar @cahlrstorrie does donald trump want to be president?were going to win again.be aggressive and seize them when they come.watch my interview with @ericbolling on @foxnews today at 11:30am et
@colinswood  @realdonaldtrump is worth more than all of the other presidential candidates combined and plenty more.keep working hard.we’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own.actually they will take over iraq and all of their oil.hes got all meetings locked down no transparency only his illegal leaks.he doesn't have the strength!@drewhemijk  thanks drew..general john allen who i never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against isis.@greggjarrett <url>
