Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel

@tokindaddy: @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Brian don't try take Trump on with your wit".I mean, she goes along with everything.....alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history tradition and importance of the House Chamber.Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.The United States must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or Ebola will be all over the United States-a plague like no other!It will be done!<URL>

Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you.Because what’s happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.Our great Senator (and Star) from the State of Arkansas @TomCottonAR has just completed a wonderful book Sacred Duty about Arlington National Cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion.But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, Im now leading Hillary Clinton.Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC.So heres what we did.Tough numbers for the Radical Left Democrats to beat!I am no fan of Bill Cosby but never-the-less some free advice - if you are innocent do not remain silent.Thank you @SenatorTimScott!<URL>

Thanks to @SteveKingIA for the kind introduction at the IA Freedom Summit &amp; congrats to @David_Bossie &amp; @Citizens_United on a great success!I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti.They didnt have Caterpillars.It is another monstrosity a la ObamaCare.My kids never negatively discussed my criticism of President Obama with me or anyone...it's not in their nature!Very productive talks yesterday with China on Trade.9:00 P.M.and your equilibrium will be kept in check if hard times hit.@FameWhoreBuster @billmaher  Thanks.Incredible people.WE HAVE A BADEN EMMY, WE HAVE AN ENEMY THAT IS DISHONEST AND A PRESS THAT IS DISHONEST.The greatest abuse of a country that I think I've ever seen financially -- China.Not all false.It costs too much!I said NO and the game was over.@largemarv74 @Yankees  Not even close but that doesn't matter!I don't believe @BarackObama knows that he selling us out.We won the presidency.Good things are going to happen!China and Russia voted with us.Q Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as —

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would.And you know, Ive met a lot tougher people but Ive never met any human that lied as much as him.What Bill did was stupid!Congressman Ron DeSantis a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida.Nobody.But they want a Redo or Do Over.Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.I think maybe there’s no more important point.#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou<URL> <URL>
Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..<URL>

Great poll- Florida!And that is a real problem!@anniehic @NYMag And so have many others.@Abdul_Akbarzai1:  @TheRealZach49: @realDonaldTrump can't wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what Obama destroyed"
@D_Mellette: @realDonaldTrump for president 2k16
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots!From an amazing day on the border in Laredo.And I said them a long time ago, and I was right.One way or the other we will win on the Wall!But you look at upstate New York, you look at Ohio, you look at Pennsylvania.Thank you Mr. President.The Democrats &amp; Shifty Schiff whose presentation to the Senate was loaded with lies and misrepresentations are refusing to state that the Obama Administration withheld aid from many countries including Ukraine Pakistan Philippines Egypt Honduras &amp; Mexico.Were going to make America great again.The walls going to cost $10 billion to build.Enjoy!So much to talk about - see you there!Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for.They would have used your $1M to extract donations" from others"

The Democrats want to run a Country and they cant run a Caucus.Mexico is going to pay for the wall.<URL>
Yesterday in Pittsburgh I was really impressed with Congressman Keith Rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure).Big danger.None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster.The Democrats have no message  not on economics not on taxes  not on jobs not on failing #Obamacare.With proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base.Because you know, weve got men, weve got women.#TrumpforTriumph

The real estate market in Vietnam is booming..Still sold at Trump Tower...The story in the @nytimes about the U.S. escalating attacks on Russias power grid is Fake News and the Failing New York Times knows it.When will the Fake News Media start asking Democrats if they are OK with the hiring of Christopher Steele a foreign agent paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC to dig up dirt and write a phony Dossier against the Presidential Candidate of the opposing party.........

Incredibly proud of my son @EricTrump &amp; his efforts on behalf of @StJude in Memphis TN.I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out.Jack Lews handwriting shows while strange that he is very secretivenot necessarily a bad thing.Theyve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation...
One my way to New Mexico  see you all shortly at the @StarCenter!So it says "$50 million or more", I go 50.who was so inaccurate?.Just had a very open and successful presidential election.Just remember that.The President says look this is your neighborhood youve got to stand up to protect yourselves.It’s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.#MAGA

CNN is the worst - fortunately they have bad ratings because everyone knows they are biased.Its a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq.And Ill say it and I know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say thats really  because Im a conservative, but Im a common-sense conservative.Why does @BarackObama support the radical Islamists in Egypt protests yet has such a high disregard for the Tea Party?A-Rods lawsuit trying to overturn a binding arbitration agreement is going nowhere.They said it couldn’t be done.Military and economy are getting stronger by the day and our enemies know it.@J_Feeds03: Even if @realDonaldTrump doesn't run for the GOP I'm writing him in on my ballet.He’s embarrassed.We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see whats happening.#AmericaFirst  <URL>

Q    Do you think all three should have a chance — all three should have a chance to speak?Again, I say it — there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!Additionally and for many years....

Wow @SharylAttkisson  just wrote the definitive piece on what I said about John McCain <URL>
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians.Thanks!This isnt some game.He has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes border security and crime prevention.He is a great guy and player.OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!Trump doesnt want money therefore we cant  even though hes better than all these guys, even though hes going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that.The next day, were watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart.Im not going to tell anybody what to do.Who would do this?@TopSecret_PT: @realDonaldTrump - Ireland Scotland Dubai!You should highlight that point.So, we are going to make our country so great.Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor.Staying at the trump hotel.Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped.Slowing down the fun.He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama.Our next President must stop China's Rip-off of America.<URL>
Thank you Arizona.You want to move to Mexico, build your factory, its going to be wonderful.He is  fully vaccinated and ready for kindergarten in September.Communities all over Scotland are fighting this loser.MUST BE CHANDED but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency.They can also cause War!At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.!!And we need great trade deals and were going to make great trade deals.Oil is secured.Now everything about Obamacare was a lie.I am not looking for an....Totally lost it!And then if we want to buy  we want to move to another location, well, thats very expensive if we do that.Interest rate costs should have been much lower &amp; GDP &amp; our Countrys wealth accumulation much higher.Puts our agents &amp; military overseas in danger.Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.@SenRickScott  @senatemajldr @SenJohnBarrasso  @SenBillCassidy

Funny how the Fake News Media doesnt want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President.Youll see it later.So I want to thank everybody for being here.The U.S. is respected again!But I'd rather expose them as losers!How can Senator Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam) pass judgement on anyone?.@seankesser: @realDonaldTrump: Trump University was exceptionally highly rated.He led through lies and deception only to be replaced by another beauty Cryin Chuck Schumer.We will bring back our borders.Mexico will not let people through!They create their own violence and then try to blame others.You provide a great and important service to the people of Scotland!My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time.<URL>
Mark my words a gallon of gas will be $5 during the summer.When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money.Again for all of the haters and losers I have NOTHING to do with Atlantic City - got out a long time ago!Visit us when youre President.And were going to pay for that and its going to cost less money  its going to cost less money than the system we have now  and youre going to end up getting much better care.@RickyTheBitch.<URL>
