Karl Rove --lost GOP both Houses of Congress and the White House--gave us Obama.We’re here today to launch our plans to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers.In making big money knowledge is far more important than any other ingredient including money itself!@BarackObama  does a great job for the country.#TrumpForPresident2016 We need someone who loves America in office!I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR.If we stand for these things — safety, prosperity and peace — then there is no limit to what we can achieve:  A future where millions are lifted from welfare to work.Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, its obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension
Where the hatred comes from and why, well have to determine.Tremendous guests a must see  Enjoy!Besides they smartly just left the project.There was NO Collusion &amp; Mueller knows it!And by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular.Will be leaving the Philippines tomorrow after many days of constant mtgs &amp; work in order to #MAGA!The @USCG @FEMA and all others along with other countries that have been helping have been asked to move people in the badly hit sections of the Bahamas to other sections of the Bahamas.....And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy.Unless youre @KarlRove.I will be on State of the Union @CNN with @jaketapper at 9am.#trumpisawesome #trumpcard #capitalism

Its sad.Thanks!Let them!Carl Icahn, one of the great businessmen, and others have endorsed me.What about their criminal records?Five?@BarackObama will hear loud and clear today the message NY-9 is sending by electing @Bobturner9th -- @Israel is our friend and ally.And then what happened  I ran against all these Senators and Governors.At least 3.5M fellow Americans are going to lose their healthcare plans because of ObamaCare.Also on my first day I’m going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.Great!I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.Started by little Eric Schneiderman &amp; Coumo.You’re doing precisely what you’re criticizing the President for doing.Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan.If the Democrats win it is all over.Islamophobe.It’s almost like, in the meantime, we won.Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes.<URL>

It's good to see that @FLGovScott is protecting the sanctity of this November's elections Voter fraud must be broken.Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!They say, "Is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?"The win was far bigger than anticipated - there was just nothing the Fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory.@h5o_dano: @realDonaldTrump We are on course of imploding as the once great Roman Empire did.Docks &amp; electric grid dead.<URL>

I dont know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading but it sure wasnt the one given to me.DOJs Emails &amp; Notes show Bruce Ohrs connection to (phony &amp; discredited) Trump Dossier.And we’ve just started on that one.Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger stronger party!They will soon!The enthusiasm blows away our rivals on the Radical Left.Isn't that what you want for your president?@The_Life_Of_DG: @realDonaldTrump you know how to lead!If he actually read the biased Mueller Report composed by 18 Angry Dems who hated Trump....
....he would see that it was nevertheless strong on NO COLLUSION and ultimately NO OBSTRUCTION...Anyway how do you Obstruct when there is no crime and in fact the crimes were committed by the other side?It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.If this is the new standard every President from here on out is impeachable.Unbroken.Over the last 15 years Iran has gained more....

I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning.Going up fast.Iran is toying with our president - buying time and laughing at the stupidity of our leadership.Having ZERO impact.Cant do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN whose ratings have suffered gravely.The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment.This has been an amazing evening.I want to get into the business.My patients are beside themselves.But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement.I wrote down some notes...and its like devastating.#CelebApprentice

@FuctChecker: We need less #isis and #ebola and #obama and more @realDonaldTrump True!Agent - Not good for Kremlin.You can see the contrast between the steady assured informed and strong leadership that VP Biden (Sleepy Joe) has shown and the bungling chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. (not Pres.)Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.12 <URL> What took @CBS so long to release this footage?And to the congressmen and congresswomen, we very much appreciate you all being here.@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Thank you!She was two hours late.Mainstream media seldom mentions!They gave us the insurance policy.Looked great on Letterman.We must simplify the tax code and start making our own products again to bring our jobs back from overseas.@moviesharkd: Must See" Interview!And they take our jobs and a lot of other things.Thank you!We got to reduce it.They had no intention of having a proper investigation.Look, I disavowed.Then they said, "Well, hell never sign and hell never file his financials because who knows, maybe hes not as rich as people think."We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see whats happening.Lets do it'

Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING but would Peace House/Freedom House on the Border of North &amp; South Korea be a more Representative Important and Lasting site than a third party country?The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam.Now doing The Today Show with Ivanka.We could make America great again by spreading ObamaCare throughout the World while at the same time  dropping it from U.S.!We need more Republicans!Great going Janie!Under my Administration Medicare Advantage premiums next year will be their lowest in the last 13 years.Elisabeth is a tremendous person and will be missed on @theviewtv.Via @DMRegister BY @JenniferJJacobs: @SteveKingIA ramps up with first TV ad Trump event <URL>
